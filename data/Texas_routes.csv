Going to the effort to set up a TR for Pointless Wonder probably is pointless; it feels much easier than many other 5.4 routes I have climbed.

This is not a route for a new trad leader, as it is on sketchy limestone. It's not really a route for anyone except a trad climber desperate to place gear in an area swarming with bolts. The rock is weak, some of the placements are questionable, and the top-out and belay are a mess. But for some reason, I've done this route twice now, lol. And it provides an opportunity to use a coveted Black Totem if you have one!  The finish is brushy and dirty, and then you have to fight through brush to set up a belay off trees. Lots of fun. Fortunately, you can lower your second and then crash through a little more brush to reach a trail that takes you back down.  Although my two ascents in the spring of 2018 are the only two lead ascents of which I know, I'm not claiming an FA on this because someone had probably at least free soloed it already. But if I ever find out I did do the FA, then I might name it ""Really Pointless Wonder.""

Originally, this was a trad route and can still be done that way, but almost all of the few who climb it now toprope it. The PG 13 rating refers to the sketchy placements and run-out sections if you do this as a trad route.  Start below the lower end of a diagonal crack. After the pretty burly start, climb to a thin crack that leads up to a cave. The original trad route, which goes at 5.9, stops here and the climber walks off left. But the 10a finish involves pulling through the cave. Until you figure it out, it may feel a lot tougher than 10a.  This is a fun route and, if it's not beneath your dignity to toprope in a sport area, it's worth doing and you can almost always find it open because you have to actually build an anchor and not a lot of Austin climbers relative to the size of the community know how to do that or have the gear for it.",{200358036: 3}
Arete/Bulge,112806790,Sport,106090212,5.10a,30,1,2.5,38.0,"Presently, there are five bolted routes on Guide's Wall. This is the one farthest left.  There are actually several ways to do this route:  5.7 (Arete)-- Climb the face to the roof below the cave and pull up onto the big ledge next to the cave. Finish on the arete. Many think that this feels harder than 5.7.  5.9 (Arete direct)-- Instead of stepping onto the huge ledge and then back onto the arete, go straight up from the third bolt. Opinions of this grade range from 5.8+ to 5.10a.  5.10a (Bulge Lite)-- Pull up into the cave and traverse left onto the arete to finish.  5.10b (Bulge)-- Pull the cave to the anchors.  The bolt placements seem to suggest the 5.7 or 5.9 in mind.  For extra fun, clip one of the anchors and then top out, using older chain anchors up above as your anchors. To avoid a potential backclipping-like situation, put a draw on one of the anchor bolts instead of using the sport anchors. The topout moves are fun and make the route 5.10a or b for sure. If you do this, I recommend rapping off; lowering from there or belaying a second from there will have the rope moving over a sharp edge.  Although this is a bolted route, there are older bolts up above for toprope anchors. Walk to the right past the wall and find a rugged, brushy use trail that leads up and back to the top. Or lead one of the easier routes on the wall and top out.","{200659448: 4, 200434283: 3, 200293111: 3, 200148173: 3, 200415292: 3, 108549143: 3, 200358036: 3, 200059845: 3, 200129067: 3, 200133999: 3, 110098525: 3, 111256939: 3, 200839231: 3, 200393716: 3, 200871869: 3, 200615388: 3, 200395027: 3, 200654652: 2, 200088662: 2, 200476847: 2, 200155823: 2, 200436783: 2, 109376488: 2, 111612282: 2, 106963532: 2, 108679988: 2, 200060285: 2, 108691931: 2, 200097611: 2, 111968792: 2, 200162881: 2, 108280591: 2, 200200829: 2, 200444279: 2, 200241666: 2, 110816370: 2, 200944849: 2}"
Flash Crack,112134969,Sport,106090212,5.7,25,1,2.1,37.0,"In the middle of the wall are three crack systems. Flash Crack is the one on the right.  This route, and the other two crack routes to its left, was bolted in the fall of 2016, and there are sport anchors above it and the others.  The old TR anchors above are still there for those wanting to take the dirty trail approach to the top. For that, you need around 30' of cord or webbing to get your master point over the edge. From the ugly grooves atop some of the routes at this crag, I can tell some people have TRd without a properly set anchor, and this damaged the rock and could potentially damage the rope, no matter how polished some of the rock here is.  There apparently is disagreement about whether routes at the Greenbelt can go on gear, but this one can if you trust the rock and your placements. One problem is that there is no pro for the start of the route (which is easy but still slick enough that even an experienced climber might slip off). You can get a Tricam in one of the pockets lower down, but it doesn't inspire a ton of confidence. After the run-out, there is good pro, with good stances, the rest of the way. Passive gear recommended.  The newest edition of the guidebook slightly downgraded this route to 5.6/5.7. We'll see what the community says in the long run, but I feel many of the Greenbelt routes actually could be bumped up at least a grade due to the polish, which is definitely a factor on some climbs, including this one.","{200234460: 3, 111256939: 3, 200358036: 3, 109376488: 3, 200476847: 3, 108549143: 3, 112357776: 2, 107993865: 2, 200293111: 2, 200029569: 2, 200405738: 2, 200415292: 2, 200180818: 2, 200129067: 2, 200615388: 2, 200155823: 2, 200400897: 2, 200434283: 2, 200678912: 2, 110948161: 2, 110652833: 2, 112423730: 2, 106963532: 2, 108679988: 2, 200060285: 2, 112383380: 2, 110098525: 2, 200151120: 2, 109568674: 2, 111968792: 2, 200162881: 2, 200444279: 2, 200477015: 1, 200080589: 1, 112070348: 1, 200241666: 1}"

Stand Off is the third as you go from left to right. Until September 2016, this was a TR route using bolts located on a short wall above the top-out ledge, and it served as a sketchy trad lead as well. Now it has three bolts and sport anchors. On at least one other website, this route is listed as a 5.5. It is not 5.5; the submitter likely confused this with Thin Crack (once 5.5 here but 5.6 in the guidebook), and a new leader may very well find himself in way over his head if he jumps on it thinking it is 5.5. The crux is an awkward sequence from the third bolt to a great jug below the anchors. Moving between B2 and B3 also gives some people trouble. In the photo, the rope is set on Thin Crack. Stand Off is just to the right.

Snowtards,117951140,Trad,105976829,5.6,30,1,2.3,4.0,"Sometime by summer 2019, the huge tree at the right end of Seismic fell, and its absence cleared the start of an entirely different line about a yard or so right of Black Slabbath. So on July 19 I led Black Slabbath and set some directionals to facilitate TRing this ""new"" route.  On September 22, I went back and led it trad. Because the placements were sketchy and there were fewer than I thought there'd be, I will not describe them or recommend gear. Basically, I led it trad just in case I really did do the FA and someone came along and said it didn't count because it was on TR.  To anchor, I crossed over to the Black Slabbath anchors and placed a cam and a hex along the way to protect that short, easy traverse. While I have used that rock before for directionals and have rapped off such placements, that time I found that the rock there has gone from questionable to terrible, and I even trundled some large pieces. However, there is still okay rock if you look for it.  If there is a party on BS, you will need to go up into the brush to find solid trees for anchors; the rock around the topout is not sufficient for building a safe anchor. You can TR this off the BS anchors, but a fall will mean a big swing left, possibly crashing into a climber or rope on Die Easy just  left of BS. So basically don't climb this route unless DE and BS are unoccupied or you are willing and equipped to lead the route and then crash through brush.  My 5.6 is based on not using the fallen tree to start and on pulling onto the ledge just above where the anchors likely would be were this a sport route. Otherwise, this is maybe 5.4.  As to the name-- there has been a recent fervor in the Austin climbing community to rename ""offensive"" route names. My name for the route is a poke in their collective woke eyes.

A classic Jeff Jackson route, only saw a handful of ascents in the 90s before falling into the obscurity of Urban Assault. Thanks to EvJohnson and Matt Glass this route has been rebolted with glue-ins (Oct. 2018) and outfitted with a few permadraws, and it's a true monster of a route. Route tops out on a triumphant ledge with an amazing view of the Greenbelt.  Thought of as Starfish's older brother, this sport route will test many weaknesses with its variety of moves, holds, and angles. Be it known that there are drilled/chipped holds on Plate Techtonics [sic, as named in Jefe's two Texas Limestone guidebooks], as there are on many UA routes. Also in keeping with UA fashion, many holds on this route get quite manky in wet weather, fortunately not quite as bad as on Starfish. Jeff Jackson thought this route ought to be restored, as the best, most historical route at Urban Assault.  Hardest route on the Greenbelt? For a long time the two hardest were Disneyland and Plate Techtonics, both at 5.13b. During the rebolting of this route, a few holds (jugs) broke off due to the choss of Urban Assault, and this route is significantly harder than it was, Hank Caylor even suggesting that it could be 13c or 13d in its original state. That being said, we're comfortable giving this 5.13+ now, until one of those team kids flashes it...

But to make it fun, just run it out...In Hogge's guidebook, it states the climb starts to left on a chimney up to the ledge (dirty too) and walk back the roof, or you can direct start on face below ledge for a bouldery start up to ledge. Once you reach back of the cave, find first bolt, and either lay back and traverse left or hand jam across...I've done both and they are both effective. Crux is definitely pulling the lip...there are a few techniques you can employ to reach anchors...I hand jammed and it hurt like hell...the stone is sharp inside those cracks.

Also, the route does not appear to have been touched anytime recently if ever at all. However, it would not astonish me if someone has free soloed this route before, and I have no problem being corrected and removing my claim of an FA on a 20' limestone trad route.  Since the routes at the Matrix have names that are references to the movie, my name for this route is in keeping with that since it alludes to Agent Smith's famous assessment of humanity. It also is a nod to the coronavirus outbreak at the time I climbed it. Note to virtue-signaling scolds-- the park was open to climbing at the time, and the one person with me was someone from my household.  This route has no bolts and no top anchors, and it would be nice to see it stay that way, unlike Trinity, which never needed to be bolted.  About the grade-- my son thought it felt no harder than 5.6 except for the slipperiness of the mossy part, but he admitted his perspective could have been skewed by being on toprope. I thought the bottom was harder due to tougher feet than what is typical of 5.6 around here, but I think 5.8 might be pushing it.",{200358036: 1}

The route makes a nice final climb of the day because it is easy to top out from the anchors and then the parking lot is just seconds away. You can sling a large tree a few yards back from the topout to use as an anchor.  This route can go on trad gear, though the rock quality is questionable. Passive gear recommended, but to protect the finish you need large cams or to rely on a pocket that will take a cam or Tricam. Clip one of the anchor bolts if you are topping out.  I believe in deferring to the FA when sharing a route here, and so I have submitted it at the grade the FA gave, but I really think it is more like 5.4 or 5.5. ",{200358036: 2}

Prototype is the right most of two lines that share the first bolt (the other is Mas Cerveza, 5.11) just to the right of the shallow dihedral at the base of Clone Call. The start overhangs a little - pull up onto a bulge using a good flake. Be sure to clip the first bolt before making any moves up the bulge or you could deck if you slipped. Look for a good two finger pocket with the right hand while you pinch with the left. Pull through the bulge to a good stance (crux). The middle part of the climb is thin, but has plenty of rests. Look for a great hold at the last bolt (a ""squirrel cage""). The second difficulty on the route is moving from the last bolt to the chains.

At the start, there's a ledge to post up on. After a little hop to get up on the first foothold, the first 12-15 feet are very juggy - easy holds and plenty of feet space. About 15 feet up, the easy jugs run out, and you are left with a crack about 3 ft below the top. Place your fingers within the crack, and hike your right foot up and get a solid footing in the hold to your right. From here, you can lift up and grab the top, which is a high angle and easy to grab. Place your left foot in the small hold to the left, and use that to press up and top out. Climb down on the right side - but watch out for the thorns.  Be warned with this route - it's a pretty high boulder, and the water below is only about 3 feet deep with rocks on either side.

Fun climbing, great protection, and a unique location make this climb a must do.  The start of Cave Crack is located above Jack Knife (see Throne Rock).  While it's possible to scramble through the boulders to reach to base, climbing Jack Knife is a lot easier (and more enjoyable).  From the top of Jack Knife, scramble down the back side of the summit block and scamper through a small opening under a large detached boulder.  Once you stand up, you'll be in a narrow, chimney-like space with a hand crack that splits the back wall.  Follow the crack for about fifty feet until you reach the top of the cave.  The crack starts as a hand crack and gradually widens as you move up.  At the top of the cave, step left onto the face, continue around the corner, and work up the widening crack.  Above the cave, the angle eases significantly, and you can walk up the rest of the climb until you find a comfortable spot to belay.  To descend, scramble down the easy slab to the anchors above Orange Peel and rap with a single rope to the base.

Two rappel bolts are located at the top of the rock on a small summit block.","{106908078: 4, 106371030: 4, 110690111: 4, 107430316: 4, 108531417: 4, 107771964: 4, 105992870: 4, 200311897: 4, 200288599: 4, 200378490: 4, 107565147: 3, 106008811: 3, 106118197: 3, 107731330: 3, 107903022: 3, 107742336: 3, 107590530: 3, 106028280: 3, 105955823: 3, 106548716: 3, 106657189: 3, 106693041: 3, 107229353: 3, 108436130: 3, 109182254: 3, 107193262: 3, 109127888: 3, 108940753: 3, 105911703: 3, 106980350: 3, 107590584: 3, 108659753: 3, 110578804: 3, 110866997: 3, 110416190: 3, 111971498: 3, 110875347: 3, 108819880: 3, 108865746: 3, 107931921: 3, 112383272: 3, 112357776: 3, 200130915: 3, 200251166: 3, 200132139: 3, 108744559: 3, 110330190: 3, 110692734: 3, 108846339: 3, 200393659: 3, 108280591: 3, 200232920: 3, 200405738: 3, 200643791: 3, 108088813: 3, 200432921: 3, 110948161: 3, 200749748: 3, 200411906: 3, 200476847: 3, 107572100: 2, 10186: 2, 107460058: 2, 107415519: 2, 105853720: 2, 107932671: 2, 107596919: 2, 106308650: 2, 106610639: 2, 106793054: 2, 105805097: 2, 106949749: 2, 107168466: 2, 107469950: 2, 108948173: 2, 108236363: 2, 109325110: 2, 109239913: 2, 108192046: 2, 109862305: 2, 105942841: 2, 107552170: 2, 109699387: 2, 108025275: 2, 108995157: 2, 111819602: 2, 107390101: 2, 111694003: 2, 107993865: 2, 109212991: 2, 109525599: 2, 109423069: 2, 111965953: 2, 107041196: 2, 107441340: 2, 108679988: 2, 111031033: 2, 111268597: 2, 109970746: 2, 108746269: 2, 111153232: 2, 109266549: 2, 109067090: 2, 107697969: 2, 112783567: 2, 112112202: 2, 111612282: 2, 112444283: 2, 111135486: 2, 200065690: 2, 110274904: 2, 111997608: 2, 200220853: 2, 200266087: 2, 200216014: 2, 111496831: 2, 110802587: 2, 200395005: 2, 200066042: 2, 200173921: 2, 200463986: 2, 200178248: 2, 200631679: 2, 110816370: 2, 200222568: 2, 200400897: 2, 106858324: 2, 200500333: 2, 200673180: 2, 200601914: 2, 112154993: 2, 200200829: 2, 106883214: 1, 106065156: 1, 107764168: 1, 108207349: 1, 109463255: 1, 108385860: 1, 106709484: 1, 108355105: 1, 112329508: 1, 112405167: 1, 110652833: 1, 200279628: 1, 200184824: 1, 107489940: 1, 200393716: 1}"

The Kracken is named for James Crump's internet handle. Crump is responsible for much of the parks early development and many of it's first ascents.    This route was bolted on lead in 2008 in old school traditional style. To my knowledge this is the last line at Erock to be bolted from the ground up. Since then it has become a very popular line. Presumably because it is quite reasonably protected by Erock standards.    Pitch 1: Start on the low angle slab and clip one bolt before the overlap. The second bolt can be found on top of the overlap and can be clipped before pulling the first of two cruxes. Above the overlap continue up easy well featured slab, following the line of bolts. Belay on the large comfortable Boston Ledge under the trees. Double bolted rap bolts are found here. Take long slings or know how to anchor in with the rope. The anchors are otherwise placed a bit too high and far apart to allow for a comfortable belay.    Pitch 2: There are two bolted lines leaving the ledge. The first bolt above the ledge can be used for both. Kracken is the line to the right and Newark goes left. After clipping the second bolt it may be helpful to back track and unclip the first bolt to reduce rope drag. The third bolt protects the second crux. After the crux, climb the lower angle black streak that is shared with Dome Driver. Three more bolts are located on the black streak before reaching the double bolted anchors that are also shared with Dome Driver. From here there is a short 4th class scramble to the top if you are walking off or rappelling with a single sixty from the News Wall anchors.

Mark of the Beast,105860218,Sport,105860215,5.8+,0,3,2.8,105.0,"Mark of the Beast is probably the longest, vertical, non-contrived route in the park.  The route is a well-protected three-pitch slab route that climbs the right side of the Devil�s Slide.  The first pitch is also known as Christine�s Variation and is a great 5.6 climb just by itself.    P1. Start at the base of a long, clean slab just left of the prominent overlap that marks the left side of the Cheap Wine Wall.  Climb past seven bolts to a pair of top anchors in a shallow dish just right of the Fatman Flake.  While there are a couple sections where the wall is a little steeper, there is no real crux.  Fun, 5.6 climbing to the anchors.    P2. Climb up and left from the P1 anchors past the Fatman Flake.  The crux is a steep smooth headwall that leads to the first bolt (5.8/5.9 range).  Once past the first bolt, the angle and the climbing both ease significantly.  Climb past two more bolts to a two-bolt belay on the Broadway Ledge.  Short pitch.    P3. Another short pitch.  Climb an easy slab up and right from the P2 anchors to a two-bolt rap station.    From the rap anchors on top of P3, rap with two ropes back to the P1 anchors near the Fatman Flake.  A second two rope rappel gets you back to the ground.  You could also scramble up a low angle slab and walk off the top of the dome.","{108948173: 4, 109193330: 4, 110692734: 4, 200042162: 4, 107931921: 4, 200220853: 4, 107771964: 4, 200659448: 4, 10186: 3, 105995251: 3, 107590530: 3, 107969058: 3, 106157321: 3, 105955823: 3, 105932818: 3, 105872171: 3, 106610639: 3, 106657189: 3, 106992957: 3, 107372520: 3, 107430316: 3, 108055813: 3, 107680316: 3, 106175151: 3, 106371030: 3, 108653005: 3, 109182254: 3, 109325110: 3, 109591746: 3, 106980350: 3, 108365880: 3, 107742336: 3, 110195133: 3, 110422165: 3, 111085397: 3, 110789762: 3, 110690111: 3, 109373054: 3, 109840153: 3, 108746269: 3, 111709307: 3, 111769296: 3, 111819602: 3, 112203230: 3, 110948161: 3, 107441340: 3, 111031033: 3, 111268597: 3, 112472466: 3, 111153232: 3, 112566193: 3, 108819880: 3, 110874352: 3, 107069753: 3, 106252975: 3, 112357899: 3, 200185091: 3, 108744559: 3, 200132139: 3, 111849078: 3, 111870632: 3, 107958810: 3, 200210266: 3, 200054289: 3, 109978240: 3, 200358036: 3, 200463986: 3, 200415292: 3, 108341207: 3, 200643791: 3, 200441231: 3, 200411906: 3, 200452561: 3, 200130915: 3, 200274148: 3, 108679988: 3, 105836027: 2, 106929372: 2, 106771485: 2, 106464390: 2, 107347962: 2, 107247400: 2, 107415519: 2, 109239913: 2, 109862305: 2, 106709484: 2, 108390129: 2, 109481110: 2, 107993865: 2, 107079403: 2, 106782997: 2, 108865746: 2, 109525599: 2, 112306364: 2, 112405167: 2, 108736782: 2, 200031119: 2, 200156348: 2, 108280591: 2, 200076423: 2, 112153709: 2, 200400897: 2, 107938148: 1, 111174316: 1, 112233101: 1}"

However, according the story I heard, the ground below the problem was washed away and badly eroded after it was first documented. Consequently, getting off the ground is much harder than the 5.9 grade implies.    After figuring out a way to start it, continue up the lower angle slab. Then pull the tricky to protect boulder problem found on top of the slab to the climber's left.    The descent is also less than ideal.

The rock quality is generally pretty good, but it tops out into a semi-rotten trough that is pretty much always filled with debris. About 4 years prior to this writing I cleaned out the crack which was quite packed with mud and debris. As of about a year and a half ago it was still clean. Honestly, this is a pretty good crack and worth doing.    Please don't be tempted to sling the large egg shaped boulder that is balancing on the edge of the trough above We Be Joes and use it as an anchor. I absolutely would not trust it to stay put.

It starts left of a large tree and follows a black water streak to a chute up top. Along the way, there is an overlap to pull, and this is probably the crux. People sometimes drift left along the overlap and use some of the Baba Wawa holds. That's fine, but that's not the 5.9.  Originally, this was done as a free solo by James Crump and Mike Head, and in Crump's Dome Driver's Manual, it is a 5.9- X. Just about everyone topropes it now, and it is listed as a TR in a newer guidebook, but I have listed it in keeping with the FA.  If you wanted to lead this on gear, you could get a marginal/poor piece to protect pulling the overlap, and there is a horizontal flake below the top-out that would probably break if you fell on a cam or cammed Tricam. If you fell on either piece and it blew, you would deck, so considering that and the quality of the rock, this really is an X lead.  In the chute at the top are two Metolius rap bolts known as the News Wall anchors. Please leave these open for parties rappelling, especially on weekends and on other busy days. There is a large boulder behind the anchors, and you can hang a TR masterpoint over it. Doing so will also result in much less rope drag than using the anchors will.  Note: in DDM, this route and Baba Wawa are part of the Prok Wall, which is part of the Shield. However, the newer O'Grady guide has them on News Wall. Since the person who submitted the BW page put it with News Wall and since most people call the anchors above BG the News Wall anchors, I have included BG under News Wall as well.",{200358036: 3}

Prok likely went up a short time later. In keeping with traditional principles, the shallow dihedral was left unbolted. Accordingly, this climb carries an X rating.

Once above the crack you encounter another mantle and access to the fourth (5th) bolt. Move a little left and climb up to a short ramp and the fifth (6th) bolt. A long run out of around 35' up and right takes you to the rap anchors and finishes the first pitch. The second pitch is on easy but run out rock to the top. There are belay anchors at the base of a large boulder at the top. You may also use the rap anchors that will deposited you at the base on French Route.,"{107465641: 4, 200389770: 4, 108746269: 4, 111819602: 4, 109325110: 4, 200031119: 4, 107931921: 4, 200054289: 4, 12023: 4, 109082144: 4, 109285131: 4, 106371030: 4, 106657189: 4, 106323527: 4, 105939248: 4, 105829612: 4, 107680316: 3, 108355105: 3, 109239913: 3, 107069753: 3, 107938148: 3, 106573189: 3, 107547293: 3, 106709484: 3}"

Move your feet around and reach the pinch right at the lip. From here there are several ways to finish, and the next move or two are the crux. However you do it you will be tic-tacing your way up some pretty small holds that are on a vertical wall while your feet are still on the overhang.

The left finish is nice for top roping the 5.11+.  The right hand connection to Flake Roof is the recommended classic.

Thornton. -Tyler    1080p HD Video of the first send by Tyler Garrett VIA GoProCam.  youtube.com/watch?v=NEB-HUQ… watch to learn the moves to make this a must see at mineral wells.    Route Name:   When working this out I felt like we were on mission impossible because of how close to the ground you are, can't even get a pad underneath it. Luke, a sick sick sick sport climber, thinks this is a V5, but since I made the video I'm calling it a V4 ;-) because I sent it first.    Route Rating:   There are a lot of ways to go about solving this problem. My beta/moves will make it V4. A lot of intermediate moves to get to the finish but these moves will give you a challenge. At the very least do the start, drop into the bottom shelf, and work your way to the largest shelf and continue on to the finish, I wouldn't give the other beta more than a V2 rating.    Beta:   Two hand start, fall into the lower shelf of holds. Heel hook and move your way up to the crimpy right hand then off to the AMAZING pocket on the left. From their high feet and dyno for the sloper. The slope is a terrible hold, very sharp rocks near the top, and bumping to the last pocket from this is very challenging and I would consider it a V4+ if you use the slope and bump to the finish.     Rules:   Now remember boys and girls... bouldering or free climbing as they call it, is not allowed in the Park... But one climber is allowed to free climb to set the top rope! But only one person can do it!! So every time you start bouldering, be sure to tell everyone what your intent is.    Hope you enjoy the route, drop some feedback in the comments.
