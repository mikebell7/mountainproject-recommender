Crab Traverse DWS,107526170,Boulder,107523825,5.10-,30,1,2.0,2.0,It was named crab traverse for the several crab shells found in the horizontal crack as well as the crab like positioning on the first half of the traverse.    Start on the right or do everything opposite and start on the left which may be more natural but dangerous being tired over rocks at the end.  Start in the obvious horizontal crack at the first prominent overlap in the roof.  Move left on really good hands and ok high feet.  When the crack tapers off you should be above and just right of the main cove.  Move to overhanging holds and stay above the cove.  A few tricky moves into big pockets moves you down and left of the otherwise blank face.  Finish by moving a little lower and around the low overhanging arête.    The leftward variation is advised just to be cautious of the exposed rock on the first few move on the right.,"{107229353: 2, 107610322: 2}"

Rip Hide DWS,107523832,Boulder,107523825,5.10c,25,1,3.0,9.0,Named Rip Hide because it was sent when swell was big and it sliced through my hands and feet when I tried it first without tape.  Because it is a DWS route I am giving a detailed beta filled description that for some would ruin the onsight.    Traverse in from the left or climb from the water into the central cove big enough to stand in the mouth of it.  From the cove traverse up and further right to the main wide crack in the roof.  This section of the roof is surprisingly easy with huge jugs elbow deep in the offwidth roof crack.  Find a solid doorknob sized hold at the lip with your right and move your left hand to the base of a mini arête at the lip.  The next move pulling the lip is the crux.  Move your right hand to either the crack (looks easier but is probably a slightly harder move) or on the next good placement on the arête.  These moves are all fairly laybacking with your left foot plastered on the left side of the lip.  Shift a little further left and reach far with your left hand for good holds and top out.    This route is probably the safest top out route being directly in the center of the cave you would land exactly where the cliff jumpers do.,"{200112845: 4, 200442463: 4, 107229353: 3, 106602432: 3, 200280280: 3, 106735252: 3, 200188028: 3, 110625617: 2, 112826729: 2}"
