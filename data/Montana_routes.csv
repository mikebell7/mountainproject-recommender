Pitch 2 (5.9, 100'): Continue up corner system, the first half is a little sketchy/delicate with marginal gear; pull fun moves above fixed piece (equalized pin and slung block) and continue climbing to small platform in an alcove with webbing and rap ring.    Pitch 3 (5.9, 100'): Move left over roof, climb in corner system moving to the south face of the pillar to a comfortable belay ledge to the left of white roof; there's webbing slung around a rock.   Pitch 4 (5.8, 120'):  Climb left and into chimney, to corner and back into chimney; build anchor before final corner crack. Watch for lose rock on this last part.    Pitch 5 (5.8, 50'): A few moves with good hand jams into a corner crack will bring you to the top; belay from tree or slung rock.     The route can be done in 4, or even 3 pitches. I would suggest:    P1 (5.9+, about 120') Go past first nest of belay slings, continue up slabby ramp and belay at fixed piece (pin and slung rock);    P2 (5.9, about 120') Go to top of original P3    P3 to the top, save a #1-#2 Camalot for last 30' of crack.

Start at rock pile on large grassy ledge.    P1: Climb less than ideal rock for a short ways, veering right, then ascend excellent large left facing dihedral, reaching a nice ledge with 2 bolts. (5.10a, 100')    P2: Climb through overhang on right side of ledge, then up chimney. From good stance on top of the chimney, follow thin, flaring crack, past a bolt up high to large ledge and traverse left on ledge to 2 bolt anchor. Small/Micro nuts useful. (5.10a, 120')    P3: Traverse left along ledge for 60', past 1/4"" bolt, and then down large chimney to stance with a 2 bolt anchor. (5.4, 85').     P4: Move right and up from belay, then left along ledge, which slopes down, to a large horizontal flake. Hand traverse up and left to excellent vertical finger crack. From ledge at top of finger crack, follow easy, slightly winding terrain and make belay (1 rusty pin available) near the base of the large sloping OW. (5.10a, 100')    P5: Climb long, easy dihedral with 4.5"" OW crack on left (Some might want a #5 Camalot for added comfort on this pitch, but it isn't totally necessary - you can get lots of supplemental gear in cracks against the left wall and there is at least one chockstone that can be slung. Both times I've lead this pitch I didn't place anything bigger than a #3). Make belay on nice, small ledge below roofs, above small dead tree (which may not be around much longer). (5.9, 180')    P6: Start up and left through easy roof with excellent hand jams and great feet below. Continue up through more strenuous 2nd roof (big hand jams), and tricky section just above (past a 1/4"" bolt). Continue over more moderate ground to small belay ledge below left leaning crack and dihedral. (5.10+, 110').     P7: From belay, start up left facing dihedral and then move left into tricky left slanting crack. Continue up, and then move right when difficulty eases up. (NOTE: From here there are many possible variations on how to finish P7 & P8. The way I did was by going about 120' on P7 and belaying on a large ledge 20' left and around a corner from a large, healthy pine tree) (5.10c, 120')    P8: Again many ways to do this, I traversed right to the pine tree, then up easy ground to summit (not quite true summit), topping out just right of a very large but dead tree.

It is a healthy combo of sport bolted pitches and gear protected cracks. It climbs the large arete feature up the gut of the west face. It gets morning shade and afternoon sun once the sun comes around the prow. The final bit of the approach up the Mordor-esque gully can have quite a bit of fresh loose talus. Also be aware that falling rock gets funneled down into the middle of the gully, so a helmet isn't a bad idea.  P1 - 5.10c/d - Climb twin cracks and up right, through chockstone roof crack. After the roof, continue on somewhat runout 5.10-. Have a red alien or purple C4 to protect the runout and a #4 in a horizontal to the right to end the runout. Continue up blocky ramp to a tree. Belay here. 100'  P2 - 5.8 - From tree belay on good, grassy ledge, climb up well featured, but dirty slab. Skirt right around steeper slab and up into 5.6 chimney. You can sling a block for belay. You will notice a two bolt anchor to the left of the base of the chimney. This is a rap station. Just pass it and continue up the chimney. ~75'  P3 - 5.12a - Start up slopey right facing lieback flake, follow thin crimps through a traverse out right to the arete. Lieback up to a jug and continue to a horizontal where a #3 can be placed. You may want to link this pitch into the next one. Belay in right facing dihedral at single bolt and fixed nut. 5 bolts ~50'  *You can easily link P3 and P4.  P4 - 5.10b - Step left around arete and climb straight up crack system. As the crack peters out, traverse hard left to a small ledge where you can build a belay in a large, left facing flake. Belay below the first bolt of the next pitch. I don't recommend belaying from bolted anchor on far right (rap station). Hands and finger sizes, #1, #3 for belay. ~60'  P5 - 5.12b - The green and orange colored wall. A test piece of sorts for Blodgett face climbing. Awkward wide lieback flake to ledge/roof. Head up steep thin crimps to a wild shouldery boulder problem. Rest up and tackle the physical climbing above. 8 bolts, 2 bolt belay. ~70'  P6 - 5.9+ - Pretty solid, pretty juggy. 3 bolts and gear, 2 bolt anchor at summit. 130'  Descent: Walk off or rappel.  Rap w/ single 70m rope to top of P5. Single 70m rope rap to top of pitch 4. Single 70 to top of P3. Another single rope rap to a rap station down and left of the P2 chimney on a good sized ledge.

Timebinder,106954084,Trad,107251007,5.11,900,8,4.0,28.0,"P1: Entrance Exam pitch. Begin from a grassy ledge, aiming for a lone medium/small tree about 160' up and 40' right. There are 5 bolts (I think) with the first being about 25' off the deck under a small roof. Belay off tree. 5.10    P2: 25' (if that) pitch to good sized ledge with 2 bolts for belay. 5.5 Can be linked with P1 but rope drag gets very bad and it will be very tight (but doable) with a 60m rope.    P3: Slab pitch. 90' up a moderately tough slab with a cruxy akward long reach from an odd pocket. A few bolts and a think 1 pin. Leads to large ledge with double bolt belay. 5.10    P4: Traversing pitch. Climb 15' up from belay (there used to be a hidden pin that would protect from a factor 2 but it's gone now, however you can get good small cam), traverse left a little ways to nice 20' finger crack up a dihedral. Then, continue left again, to a dihedral with a bolt on its left side. Do not go up the dihedral with the bolt but continue traversing. After rounding the corner, start up, pull a small roof with good holds. Continue another 30 feet to ledge with 2 bolt belay. 5.10c 110'    P5: Hematoma pitch. Go straight up small crack with fixed pins and a bolt or two to supplement good wires and cams. Tops out at decent sized ledge with 2 bolt belay. 5.10d, 120'    P6: Red Tower Pitch. Best pitch of the route and one of the best pitches in Montana - very aesthetic.    Climb easy ground above belay, moving left to the base of the tower.  Climb 100' up sustained crack on right side of the tower, laybacking and jamming. Belay off two bolts on top of tower - small but good belay. 5.10c/d   120'    P7: Climb up and right on an easier pitch. I always seem to have trouble finding good pro on this one, but it really isn't that hard, however you may have to clear a little moss out of the cracks. Tops out on decent ledge, 2 bolt belay. 5.9, 100'    P8: Crux headwall pitch. Climb up crack from belay. 30' up moves a little left past bolt, up tough finger crack (sandbag?) for 25' feet of sustained climbing. The jams are all there but can be finicky. Top is slightly easier but not super secure. Leads to a semi-hanging belay that is now bolted, but can also continue right to alcove and belay. 5.11 100'    It seems most people rap from the top of P8 because it's so easy with all the bolted belays; however, if you traverse an easy 20' right you reach an alcove with some fixed nuts and slings, and can continue to the summit from there over short, very easy ground. My third time doing this route we finally went all the way to the top and I now regret not doing it earlier. The walk off to the back and right down a large chute is really easy and quite scenic, and it eliminates the need to drag 2 ropes up the route.    If you want to rap, two 50 meter ropes will do the trick, but if you use two 70s you can link some rappels (I've linked from the top of P5 to the top of P3, and if I remember right from top of P6 to top of P4).

There are many possible choices, apparently the center splitter up the small tower is the original start.

Continue until your rope runs out and belay from a tree. P2: (5.7 – 200 ft.) Choose from many variations, and climb up to the ledge that separates the spire into two sections.

From this ledge, walk north and around to top out.  Descent: Walk off the east side of the summit picking your way down some slabs until you can gain the gully on the north. Follow this gully down while hugging the east side of Shoshone Spire until you come to a big cliff band (you most likely hiked directly under this cliff band on your way up).

When I led this, I was by myself and had to use my Soloist and a ground anchor, and I also had to rappel the route in order to clean it, and I found that the best anchor was tying off two trees that were a little skinnier than I'd have liked but which had to do. Those first skinny trees I had any faith in were also well back from the top, maybe a good 50', so plan accordingly if you want to set a toprope.  Alternatively, you could probably belay a second from the Two Pines anchors and set a directional at the top of this route without too much trouble.

Fieval Goes West,119195985,Trad,119195578,5.10b,115,1,3.8,5.0,"Fieval Goes West begins on the canyon floor at the base of Rat Castle and climbs up through moderate and varied terrain to the ledge bisecting the cliff two-thirds of the way up (this is the access ledge to the upper climbs at Rat Castle). This route was equipped to be climbed in 2 or 3 pitches in order to practice multi-pitch technique, although it is commonly climbed in one long pitch. An ambitious climber can even tack on Ratsberry Belay, a short slab climb which begins just above the top anchors, to create a 155' line – the tallest at POR.  After two bolts above the ground, a climber reaches a sizable ledge. At the third bolt, a climbing party can set up an anchor using this bolt and a #3 Camalot. This is a good spot to belay the rest of the climb, although it is unnecessary and is there primarily for practice. If climbing the route in one pitch, one can safely skip this bolt to reduce rope drag.  Halfway up the route is a set of chain anchors just below another large ledge, which can be utilized to break the route up into smaller pitches or to use as a rappel station if the route has been climbed with a rope shorter than 70m. (The ends of a 70m rope will just barely touch the ground from the top anchors, exercise caution when rappelling!)  The bottom half of the route is mostly bolts with a couple cam placements. The upper half follows a nice crack (splitter for POR) and is protected with gear and one bolt near the top.","{108939134: 4, 112203354: 4, 112295522: 4, 200832496: 4, 200097453: 3}"

Although it is a long single pitch (55m), I set it up with a mid-station rap point. This allows the choice of two raps from the top (with a single rope) and it allows a two pitch climb with a nice bolted station at a small ledge. As there are very few two-pitch climbs at Stone Hills, it's nice to use as ""practice"" for multi-pitch climbing.  Although one of the guidebooks attributes the first ascent to another climber, don't believe it. The nature of the cliff surrounding Flame has huge variety in route selection. One or two other climbers may have halfheartedly attempted death-defying trad routes in and around that area... But Flame was prepped solely by myself, with a great amount of scrubbing, cleaning and drilling, in 1996... and I can say with great confidence, no one climbed it before me.  I chose the route very carefully and I believe it is the best climb on that whole section NW of the bridge (maybe one of the best climbs in the whole Stone Hills area). As I haven't climbed there since 1997, I really hope there has been more route development in the last 10 years?  Going from memory... I think the crux (very thin face) was on the first pitch? The second pitch is steep and sustained, with great exposure and a great view.

Go up and behind the 2nd one, which will be on your right (west). Scramble up the gully until you find a good spot to traverse onto the rib (some may want to rope up for this). Once on the rib continue 4th class scrambling up until you no longer feel comfortable ropeless and start belaying.Continue up the rib, which is mostly low 5th class interspersed with small sections of 5.8ish climbing.Eventually trend up and right through better rock until you are at the base of the prominent rock scar/headwall revealing excellent rock. Traverse right below this area to prominent chimney/left facing dihedral.Climb up the chimney/dihedral for a few pitches (mostly 5.8/9 with one move of 5.10 that is through excellent rock) until you arrive at large ledge at the top of the chimney. From here crawl through a tunnel (it's a fun squeeze at the end) at the back of the obvious cave to south face and scramble path of least resistance to summit.We belayed four 60 meter pitches, 2 on the rib and 2 in the chimney. Some parties might opt for as many as 10 pitches if you climb shorter pitches and scramble less.To descend from the summit start by scrambling southeast down 3rd class hikers route. After about 200-300 vertical feet you enter a couloir. From here you must ascend a short distance up this couloir to a col and then down the narrow couloir on the other side that leads back to North Face. This couloir had snow in it in late August that was easy to downclimb in our approach shoes but could be more challenging in different conditions, possibly requiring an axe/crampons at times. In the event you found this section too difficult it would be possible to escape down the 3rd class hikers route via Baker Lake and take the (very) long way down forest roads back to the Trapper Creek Trailhead. When the couloir/gully turns west and the gully looks ominous cut north (skier's right) and downclimb shallow dihedral. This downclimb is 4th class that gets easier the further you go, until you're back below the north face.Despite being technically moderate this is a serious route. Escape would be difficult.

Climb out of the alcove through 15 or 20 of better than it looks rock. Then climb 60 feet of sustained, technical crimping. Either climb to shiny anchor with rap rings straight up OR take the original line and climb left through two bolts and a bush to a chain anchor at the top of pillar.  Pitch 2, 5.11c -- Enter crux off the chain belay and continue through relatively sustained climbing with a few crux bits. Again you have to options for the belay. Either take it to the chain anchor (which is the rap station), or climb to the camouflaged anchor to the left.  Pitch 3, 5.11a -- Trend up and right on beautiful, featured, and sharp rock. If you aren't climbing the last pitch, I recommend lowering off the anchor and have the follower climb it as a traditional TR set up.  Pitch 4, 5.8(?) -- This pitch is much lowered angle and allegedly only takes gear. I did not climb it. It looks great though.

Handmade,113249916,Sport,111920320,5.11a,200,2,1.0,1.0,"This climb is on page 243 of the Dockins/Kalakay guidebook (Bozeman Rock Climbs 3rd Edition) and ever since the book came out, I've been curious about the crag because of it's spectacular location, but skeptical about the rock quality. I was not dissapointed with setting and the rock was about what I expected - maybe a bit worse. The route itself follows some of the only goodish rock in that section of the cliff - though I fell twice in the crux section, first by busting a big foothold, then by ripping off a handhold. The crux is the first few moves getting off the ground, then it remains sustained 5.10 for several bolts with rock that is a bit hard to read. At the two-bolt belay at the top of the first pitch there was a very ancient piece of tat from someone who rapped here. I think this route gets done very infrequently! I was about to do the same until I spotted more bolts on the second pitch and saw that it looked OK - and most importantly that it was offset from the belay so the belayer would be safe from rockfall. Overall, I thought it was worthy of the one star it gets in the guidebook. It's an interesting adventure climb in a cool location, as long as you don't get too flustered by choss. The crag is a massive choss heap, but I might go back some day to check out the 5.10",{108322788: 1}
Honey Bee Ridge,111921385,Trad,111920320,5.8,700,5,1.8,4.0,"Honey Bee Ridge climbs from south to north on the ridge that forms Evening Rock, mostly on the east side of the formation. It is an adventurous route, with lots and lots of loose rock, some runouts, and interesting route finding. It would be 4 stars if not for junk rock. The positioning and exposure are fantastic!  Most of the climbing on Honey Bee is 4th to low 5th class, but there are a few sections of ""real"" rock climbing. We would have soloed or simul-climbed significant portions if not for the hollow, exfoliating nature of much of the rock. I wouldn't recommend this climb for a new leader, but for a competent party, this climb is a great outing (if you can get comfortable on choss).  I'll describe the path we took, but if you want to keep a spirit of adventure, skip this and just go up and climb it. For those wanting more info, read on:  P1 (5.6, 30m): Scramble up on the right (east) side of the ridge till you see a brushy dihedral. Rope up here. Boulder up to the base of the dihedral, clip a fixed pin, then move through the dihedral. At the top, make an exposed step left, clip a fixed ring pin, then scramble up to a good ledge belay. It may be possible to run the first and 2nd pitch together, but rope drag could get heinous.  P2 (5.8, 30m): Go straight up the ridge from the belay on incipient cracks (harder), or traverse right from the belay and up an easy face (run out). I chose the easy face, mostly due to speed considerations. Once you regain the ridge, there are several options. I took the path of least resistance with somewhat solid rock, and found this to be decently protected steep 5.8. I was also in approach shoes, so my grades might be off. Once through the steep section, solid gear runs out, but the climbing is easy. Belay on ledge with somewhat solid gear.  P3 (5.2, 45m): Continue up loose ground and traverse the knife edge ridge. Clip a bolt where the ridge steepens. We belayed here due to rope drag, but it might be possible to continue on another 10 meters to a large, flat ledge.  P4: (5.8, 55m): From the bolt, we traversed right and off the ridge proper. This area is full of large, loose holds. Be extremely cautious. I tried to clean some of it up, but there is just more loose underneath. Tunnel up on the left side of a large boulder/protrusion on the ridge line, following the path of least resistance. This leads to a large bivy ledge. From here, make your way up either a brushy corner with marginal pro (easier) or head straight up a steep face with good gear in a flake. I chose the steep face and found it to be on good rock. From here, tend up and right till you are back on the ridge. Eventually you will reach a knife-edge portion that leads to a steep, rounded section of the ridge. I found this to be the crux of the route. It's short, and is protectable with small gear, but the rock here is marginal and a fall would be bad. Once you pull through, continue up the ridge until you reach a ledge belay with slung horns for an anchor.  P5 (4th class, 60m): From here, if you feel comfortable scrambling on junk rock with big exposure, you can unrope. We were unsure of what was coming, so we just belayed for this pitch. It is reasonably simul-climbable, but it might just be quicker to pitch it out. There is an anchor on the left that you can clip along the way to the top of the formation.  Descent: Walk-off to the north. It's pretty straightforward, but there is a description on the Evening Rock page if you want more info.","{106610639: 2, 109550390: 2, 111848070: 2, 109171331: 1}"

The third pitch (5.9) has some hollow rock, so be careful what you pull/step on. The fourth pitch (5.10) heads straight up, then follows a shallow right-leaning corner to an anchor.

There are many  ways to break up the climb due to plentiful ledges, but basically parties follow the ridge crest, finding an interesting mix of climbing problems including chimneys, slim crests, face, and  cracks, with many variations that offer harder climbing. One might choose to run out the rope if the party is experienced, and, alternatively, short pitches can be done to maintain communication and ease rope handling.    	 A single rope is adequate for completing the route.    	Begin climbing on the north side of the initial buttress by ascending a chimney. Continue to a ledge where a rap station allows descent to the south, to the base of another chimney. Climb this enjoyable and somewhat odd feature, involving a narrow squeeze through a hole at the top, or for bigger people or those carrying a pack, climbing out and right. .   	Continue up steps and reach a section of short towers which can be passed on the north. Beyond this section is a small notch, and from this point  finish left into a strange chimney/corridor, as one alternative.

Climb the corner with a good crack, but suspect rock, to the cruxy hand (or foot) traverse left 7' under the roof.

This is a strenuous and strange pitch up shallow flared cracks with cerebral climbing and sometimes tricky pro. The crux is climbing up the lower rib and wrapping around right toward the chimney into the twin upper crack-grooves. (5.11a 100')  Once around, you can make a big stem across the Skyline Chimney to rest in spots, but you have to leave the stem to enter the upper cracks.

HOWEVER, it is one of the more extreme sandbags I've encountered in Gallatin Canyon. Crux low on the route with 3 bolts, 5.11a, how bad could it be?? Well, I ended up feeling a bit like Charlie Brown trying to kick Lucy's football... should have known better, it's Gallatin Canyon!     The crux felt like maybe 11c, followed by lots of very sustained 5.10 with some 11a moves thrown in here and there. In the entire 70' pitch there are very few rests where you can shake out, and nothing close to hands-free.     Moreover, while I don't think I'd give it an R rating, it is still a somewhat serious undertaking due to the very sustained climbing with multiple tricky and fairly desperate gear placements above the bolt protected crux. I placed several clusters of two or more pieces because there were very few placements I felt great about. And even the crux felt serious because clipping the second bolt felt a bit desperate, and if you fell trying to make the clip there's a good change of hitting the ledge/giant flake that you stand on to make the first clip.      The bottom line is that this is a pretty cool route, but it would probably be rated 12- at least in the local gym.

Mostly done simply to set up for the last pitch and to avoid rope drag.Pitch 4 (5.8)Starting from the south edge of the belay tree, climb up a broad corner approximately 15 feet and then step out left onto the main face. Climb up the main face using whatever features seem most interesting (many variations possible), generally staying on the right 1/3rd of the face, aiming for a large ledge crossing the face at 3/4 height. This ledge is most easily exited by taking a groove from the left edge to the top, but many variations are possible.There is a two bolt anchor on a small ledge just before the top that makes a convenient belay.

True value, this route comes full circle with a variety of climbing styles and techniques.  With three wandering pitches, good route finding skills are a must as well as a balanced knowledge of building anchors.    P1: Begin on the north, front face with a hand sized crack that climbs about 15 feet before it turns into a bushy, tree filled section, climb past this to a large, clean belay ledge. Build an anchor. Dirty, vegetated, and barely worth it, protection here is decent and the climbing is mellow.  50' (5.6)   P1-a: Alternatively, a better way to begin is up and around the north side corner on a clean face where three more obvious variations exist.   P2: Move up and right to a small stance and continue straight up to a broken left-facing corner. Climb this until it ""empties out"" and cross right, back onto the face to a hand sized crack that ends at another obvious and clean ledge. Exciting climbing up a clean line with good and spacious gear. Build an anchor. 55' (5.7)   P3: Continue up and right through a short corner (more direct) or traverse immediately right off the belay onto the face and gain a large groove or ""birth canal"", being it Mothers Day and all? Make a straight shot following the crack towards a flake on a small bulge (crux). Fire the roof, top out, and fashion a belay. Grunting and groveling on this pitch are not uncommon. Good rock, good line, good fun. 65' (5.9)   Descent: Descend via a long walk-off to the left or right of the buttress or just walk 15' to the south and rappel using The Watchtower's Standard Route anchors if they aren't occupied.","{108116958: 4, 7063368: 4, 107568149: 3, 10517: 3, 108185849: 3, 112266335: 3, 106243568: 3, 200176344: 3, 106232467: 3, 107560585: 3, 110470284: 3, 106805065: 3, 200722765: 3, 107493445: 3, 106881716: 3, 107105339: 3, 106732485: 3, 200446602: 2, 106646308: 2, 106954045: 2, 200209525: 2, 110495353: 2, 105805486: 2, 108349379: 2, 110143545: 2, 109171331: 2, 107088515: 1, 106564849: 1, 200189307: 1}"

Either continue up the flake until it becomes too loose for comfort and traverse left (foot traverse option) or make a big reach left to a jug below the 2nd traverse bolt (hand traverse option). From here either option will require a decent span out to the best thing you can find around the corner on the arete.  ...  Crux time!

Marvel at how unlikely it is that the 1/4 pinhead bolt will actually hold as you traverse into the crack to the right of the small roof.  Climb up and follow the crack for about 25 feet until you notice a couple of horns and knobs to your left that lead into a small dihedral.  Climb up a few feet to protect and then put your big boy pants on.  Traverse the 20 feet left into the dihedral and then continue up to the crack until you reach some webbing.  Sling out your placement that you place once you hit the dihedral or prepare for suicide inducing rope drag.  Bring extra webbing and a #1 camalot to back up the anchor.   Pitch 2 - 5.8   Take the crack up and to the left of the cyclops eye passing through the crux at the roof.   Continue up this crack until you reach a small ledge with two bolts for an anchor.

Extra points for moans of agony as you scrape your body up the offwidth.  Ends on a large chalkstone suspended 400 feet off the ground.

Either build an anchor in the rat infested stank hole that is the chimney, or continue to the top if you feel like screaming at your belayer is more your forte.

Poo yourself a little as you walk across the knife edge and look for a couple of placements along the way.  Clip on in and breathe easy.

There are many variations to get to the start of the Southeast chimney route itself. Take any of the routes to the top of the balcony or use the first pitch of Exit 99 for a more direct start.    P1- (5.7) The Butterknife   Climb the obvious Butterknife flake, then make moves out to the face on the left continuing up to the manky 1/4 bolts on the face above.

Southwest Face,108184861,Trad,114088819,5.8,450,5,3.1,24.0,"This fantastic route is another one of the classics out at Humbug Spires.  This climb has jamming to face climbing to offwidthing to chimneying in 5 pitches.  While no move is harder than 5.8 the route is rather sustained in nature and packs a bit of a punch.  Shares the first pitch with the also excellent Mutt and Jeff.    Pitch 1 - 5.7    Climb the flake aiming towards the two side by side bolts. Marvel at how unlikely it is that the 1/4 pinhead bolt will actually hold as you traverse into the crack to the right of the small roof. Climb up and follow the crack for about 25 feet until you notice a couple of horns and knobs to your left that lead into a small dihedral. Climb up a few feet to protect and then put your big boy pants on. Traverse the 20 feet left into the dihedral and then continue up to the crack until you reach some webbing. Sling out your placement that you place once you hit the dihedral or prepare for suicide inducing rope drag. Bring extra webbing and a #1 camalot to back up the anchor.    Pitch 2 - 5.8   After climbing up around 20 feet take the right crack that leads to the right corner of the cyclops eye.  Just before getting to the chimney step left to a small ledge that has 2 bolts on it.   Pitch 3 - 5.8   Step right off the belay ledge aiming for the chimney formation that takes you to the right of the cyclops eye.  Clip two terrible looking bolts and then sling a nut on the third, using the attached wingnut to make sure it stays on.  Ask yourself what the hell you are doing and then continue up the chimney.  If you are wearing a backpack I'd suggest trailing it before braving the bowels of the chimney.  Continue up the chimney until reaching a vertical crack.  Continue on this vertical crack until a horizontal crack appears on the left (takes a great #2!) and then traverse back into the chimney.  Continue up until there are some large wedged chalkstones that make for a great belay spot.  This pitch can be a bit intimidating as the rock can get rather ""kitty littery"" if you get even a little off route.  Hold on tight.   Pitch 4 - 5.6/7   Continue up the large crack for 70ish feet.  Stop here to belay or if you are feeling brave and don't mind the rope drag continue to the summit.  Build an anchor on the ridgeline of the formation.   Pitch 5 - 5.3/5.4    Get your slab runout face on! Really easy climbing with one placement in the 100 ft of climbing. Heels down and mantle your way on up until you reach the anchor bolts at the top. Marvel at the view! Contemplate how the hell you will get down!     The descent is possibly one of the scariest parts of this climb. Head north towards the mountains following the ridge. Crane your neck and you will see in the distance along a thin 3 foot knife edge a bunch of bolts. Your goal is to get to these. Stay roped in for this maneuver; it is a lot weirder than it looks. Poo yourself a little as you walk across the knife edge and look for a couple of placements along the way. Clip on in and breathe easy.
