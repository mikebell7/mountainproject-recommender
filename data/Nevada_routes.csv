The section that accesses the Willow Beach gauging station has been maintained and is worth seeing.    The Nevada and Arizona gravel dumps were created when the canyon walls were scraped and the river bottom dredged to reach good bedrock for the dam.

The Dam Police also keep a small gun range in the gravel dumps just above where the trail dives into the gravel.

From there, you step left and make some thin moves off the ledge to stand on a crimpy edge and clip the last bolt.  You'll run into some exfoliation at the top of the third pitch so climb weight distributed.  Run it to safer ground. Easy to set gear anchor at the summit.  Descent is scramble climbers right around a bulge in the middle of the white slab and solo or short rope your way to the chains located under the bulge.  A 70 m may get you down without incident.  We always had two 60m ropes.  Alternately you can rap off Get Up Stand Up with a single 70 m.

Mr. Bones' Wild Ride,117005328,Trad,112494136,5.9+,600,5,1.0,2.0,"In an attempt to find an ""easier"" route up the Lake Mead Buttress, a buddy and I went on quite the adventure up the dark seam left of the main prow.  Avoid all lines that look decent, and head into the dark shadowy feature on the left side. Approach as if for Lake Mead Buttress, up the rock-studded gully to climbers right of the prow. At the base of the main wall, move left until the rock falls away and the only option is up. This is the first pitch.  P1) 5.7 - Foreshadowing. Short, easy, a warmup for what's to come      Look up towards a ledge that stands between you and the massive gully you're heading towards. Climb up on rock that is super sharp, and not confidence inspiring. The rock is mostly solid, but some parts are suspiciously wiggly. Some would say this might be a sign to turn around. Keep going. Follow the largest seam to a roof. Pray to whatever gear you've plugged below you, and commit to the better rock left of the roof, pulling over the bulge onto a great ledge. Walk up and right for some good anchoring cracks in layered rock that is somehow solid.  P2) 5.5 - The Adventure Begins. A scramble into the unknown.      Walk into the giant gully left of the main prow. Reassure yourself that all those shadows mean easy climbing and great protection. Simulclimb through the first few hundred feet of class 3 and maybe 4, gently sloping upwards and following the massive gully. Push through the plant life that seems to wisely be trying stop you from climbing this. Remember to remind yourself that the questionable stemming moves straight up or mantle onto a crumbly plant-filled ledge was totally fun and not scary at all as the rock gets worse.  P3) 5.8 R - Lead Head The rock gets worse, more vertical, and gear disappears      After a few hundred feet of class 3 or 4 gully shenanigans, a point comes when the gully starts to get vertical and one really should be on belay. We broke this up into two or three mini-pitches of 40ft or so, but it could all be done as one pitch. Gear is sparse or non-existent, and does not inspire safety. Pitch finishes with a heady, shitty climb straight up out of the gully that's swaddled you this whole time, then moves right onto a surprisingly good ledge with minimal pro. A fall from any point would be ill-advised. Belay your partner up off a slung horn that looks sorta solid, maybe.  P4) 5.9+ X - The Ride You better put on your big boy pants for this one.      Look straight up from this ledge, and spot the giant overhanging chimney/offwidth. That's your goal for the start of pitch 5. It's also the start of the good rock. Between that big crack and you is an 80 or 90ft pitch straight up an overhanging choss fest. Actually, choss doesn't even begin to describe the complete and total lack of adhesion of the cracked and layered limestone / dolomite pile before you. At this point, a rap down is not feasible in the kitty litter you've surrounded yourself in, and the only way is up. Place pro as you slowly move up and the route crumbles around you, knowing fully in your heart that the 0.5 C3 you placed is only there to look pretty. Pulling off a bread loaf sized chunk and making use of the hole it left to move upwards is a valid strategy. Finish inside or just below the chimney, anchoring on cracks that are the best you've seen in the last 300 feet with some smaller nuts and cams. Hopefully by this point you've realized what it is like to truly want to get off this wild ride.  P5) 5.8 - The Exit Gate Squeeze through and escape      Using the power of friction and adrenaline left over from the near-death experience, squeeze straight up through about 10 feet of an overhanging, perfectly parallel chimney/offwidth. A number 5 shoved above you is really useful here if you need a rest once in awhile. Exit from the top, and follow the beautiful, hand-sized crack on solid, reliable limestone to a ledgy finish with plenty of cracks for an anchor. After the terrible rock below, the amazing moves on this bomber crack make it almost worth meeting your maker the pitch before. A hundred feet or so of class 4 scrambling after this pitch brings to you to top, and off of this wild ride.  But Mr. Bones isn't done with you yet. Don't forget that what goes up, must come down. Follow the descent directions for Lake Mead Buttress.","{111550625: 1, 200232512: 1}"

The Cathedral Route,105859047,Sport,108605968,5.11c,300,3,3.3,12.0,"The crux of this route is encountered on the first pitch, and consists of a tricky sequence of moves as you move onto and off of the arete at the bottom. This is followed by a series of small edge crimps on lower angled black rock. There is another crux right below the first set of anchors.    Pitch 1: 8 bolts to LO (5.11c)- Follow the bolts through an initial loose section to an arete that leads to lower angled rock full of thin black ledges. Climb this slab to a corner with no more bolts in sight until you move right. Climb past two more bolts on clean gray rock to the anchors and a small belay ledge.    Pitch 2: 7 bolts to LO (5.10b)- Climb up and right from the anchors on clean gray rock. The starting moves are tricky, and felt hard for 5.10-. Follow the black horizontal bands upward. There is a short loose section encountered just before the next anchors.    Pitch 3: 11 bolts to LO (5.11a)- Head up and right from the anchors on good gray rock. The first three bolts through the roof are quite sustained. After about 100 feet of wavy gray rock, and several sustained sections, finish the pitch up a semi loose corner crack to anchors twenty feet below the top of the cliff. I thought this pitch to be more challenging than the first due to the continuously difficult climbing on vertical to slightly overhanging rock.    It is highly recommended that you climb to the summit, especially to see the faces of the surprised hikers as you emerge from the cliff.  Another fun alternative is to have someone meet you at the top with a picnic lunch! Be careful as the final 20ft of rock is loose... but easy.

Pitch 1, 5.9- Climb a flake with beautiful washboard holds until it ends at about 50’, continue up past a bulge to ledge with an anchor in hollow rock. Go up more washboard holds, passing a small roof on the left and aim for the shallow slot left of the dihedral. Belay on a nice ledge made of stacked blocks with a couple bolts in solid rock but wonky positions.   Pitch 2, 5.9- Step right for 10’ and go up steep rock between bulges. At the fourth bolt traverse hard right, staying below the whiter rotten rock, aiming for a short, thin, and dark crack about 80’ away where the cliff bends. Get gear in this crack, go around the corner and up easier rock to a small overhang. Belay above the overhang on a small stance on the left side go the huge cleft in the middle of the wall.   Pitch 3, 5.10c/d Climb steep rock straight up to thin ledge below the big roof. Follow the ledge right to where the roof is smaller and not as steep. Use a long runners on the bolts across the ledge or you’ll have big time rope drag. Belay on a nice small ledge above the roof.   Pitch 4, 5.8 Climb left and up easy terrain to a dihedral that ends at a big ledge. Continue on the face to the right and up to the huge ledge with the pine trees that runs across the top of the cliff.    Descent: Rappel, with two ropes, the last two pitches, then from the top of pitch two, a short rappel straight down to an anchor at the bottom of the large cleft in the middle of the wall.

Dark Matter,117393834,Sport,113361045,5.13a,640,6,3.0,2.0,"...is a demanding and super high quality new 6 pitch sport route on the North Face of the Universal Wall. Two very tough pitches (3rd and 6th) are seperated with awesome, sustained 12- level climbing. The vast majority of the rock is utterly bomber but as with any new route always be a little heads up! Wear a helmet, especially on your first time up it. Also, although it is entirely protected with bolts be aware that some easier sections on the route will likely feel quite adventurous.  -An 80 meter rope is mandatory as several of the pitches are huge -Every belay has a two bolt anchor and an easy rap set up -Goes in the shade around 11am during the summer  Pitch 1 --- 5.12a (10bolts, ~35 meters) Start off of the top of a small boulder against the wall. Climb up through grey rock turning blue and yellow to a crux getting to and over a 3 ft roof. Amazing easy chert climbing takes you to the ledge, belay off of a tree with a rap anchor.  Pitch 2 --- 5.11b (8 bolts, ~22 meters) Start 10 feet left of the tree on the ledge up great, tricky low angle rock to a belay at the base of the big blue streak. Be especially mindful of loose rock as you approach the anchor.  Pitch 3 --- 5.13a (14 bolts, ~37 meters) The crux. Several V4-5 boulder problems separated with good rests. Thin at times, thuggy at times  - an awesome pitch that just keeps going! Generally superb rock quality, especially in the second half.  Pitch 4 --- 12a (8 bolts, ~22 meters) Impeccable limestone slab trending up and right. A great warm up for the 6th pitch. Short crux section. Very comfy belay at the end of this pitch.  Pitch 5 --- 5.11d (10 bolts, ~26 meters) A little boulder problem off of the belay followed by sustained climbing to another bulge crux up high.  Pitch 6 --- 5.13a (13 bolts, ~40 meters) Impossibly thin, heartbreaker slab crux on perfect rock! The difficulty eases off after an obvious no hands stance several bolts above the business but be mindful of loose rock. Belay in a small (loose) corridor.  Rappel the route with an 80 meter rope. From the top of the crux pitch (pitch 3) you can rap straight down to a nice rap anchor to avoid the traversing nature of the crux), but it’s CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT to start a healthy swing as you rap, as it is overhanging and you will end up in space if you don’t swing as you rappel in order to reach the rap anchor and ledge. Once you reach the ledge at the top of pitch one it is possible to walk off by traversing to the climbers left.","{14659: 4, 10168: 2}"

Try not to cut feet and pull the finishing move which tops out the leaning slab that creates the shelter. If super psyched, continue up to the top of the Monkey Bar Boulder.

We added a new first bolt (with Mark's permission) to make the start a little less intimidating for climbers leading at this grade.  Thanks Mark.    P1: (5.7)  Climb the bolted face to the second anchor.  Use the first to clip a draw but continue literally 10' left and 15' higher to the second anchor for the belay. This is a really comfy ledge, be careful not to get complacent and forget you are about 60' up. (60')    The second anchor was placed by Chris Burton and Mike Burton (not related) for a single pitch route called ""Greek Tragedy.""  This climb ascends the shallow ramp to the left (east) of the direct start for the first pitch of All that, Jazz.  Looks like it takes small gear.  Thanks for the information Chris!    P2: (5.8) Trend 10' right to gain the shallow, left-facing corner/crack.  Place gear as you like in the crack using long slings to prevent drag. Use the ample face features and crack to stem, lie-back, and smear your way up. When the crack ends, look for a bolt up and to the left. Traverse to the bolt (if it seems too high, look for feet) and then continue left to the crux, a short, dead-vertical headwall that will ""go"" easily to some really fun moves!  There is a protection bolt smack in the center of the headwall to protect these moves.  Pull the headwall to a bolted anchor and a reasonable, slabby ledge. (110')    P2 Option: (5.8) If you have time, rap or lower back to the first station after the your second cleans the pitch and top rope straight up the face back to the second anchor - fun climbing that adds another 110' to the day!    P:3 (5.6) Step off left and make a few moves on the solid-varnished vertical face to a single bolt (the only one on this pitch) about 8 feet off the belay.  Continue straight up this face as it slabs off and becomes easier.  Place gear as you like in ample horizontals and try to stay to the left in the black varnish.  Trending right leads to climbable terrain but the rock quality is not as good and the placements will be fewer and more questionable!  Watch rope drag as you move higher on the slab.  There is a bolted anchor at the top, no rings or links.

Caustic Cock,105820098,Sport,105732024,5.11b,40,1,3.4,739.0,"This route follows the stunning arete feature on the NE side of the Cannibal Boulder.  Easy climbing up to the second bolt, where the real fun begins.  From here it gets steep and interesting.  The crux begins after the third bolt is clipped and includes a few desparate moves to surmount the cock, and a very desparate and kind of scary clip for the 4th bolt.  From there, a few airy crimpers lead up to bolted anchors.    This is a wonderful spot to get good climbing shots from the ground if you are a photographer.  The arete stands out against the skyline from both sides and the overhanging line looks absolutely awesome.  Be sure to bring your core face for the onlookers who frequent the area!","{107230627: 4, 107341465: 4, 105817062: 4, 106755817: 4, 107628457: 4, 106785304: 4, 105825753: 4, 105952525: 4, 107820434:

Cow Lick Co. Crag,105934692,Sport,105917681,5.7,80,1,2.2,119.0,"Once upon a time, the rotten sandstone devil had its loose hold on two, unprotected, power-hiking scrambling girls of Red Rock, until they saw the sign to save themselves. Other people have seen the signs too.   Scramblers beware    So, after many near death experiences, the girls thought they may be able to live longer as rock climbers, as it would teach them how to be safer hikers. So off they went to Borders books, and bought ""How to Rock Climb by John Long. They purchased the gear that they needed to get started, and went to the gym to learn how to use a GriGri. No classes, and two brief times in the gym was enough for the ex-prison guard red head who ran a mens pod, and the brunette who grew up in the not-so-nice neighborhoods in LA. Besides, John Longs book was their new bible.     So off they went to lead a climb, and practice with their new toys. The girls decided to go to Calico Basin, after working day shift, where they had once seen bolts while out hiking on this climb called Cow Lick Co. Crag. The girls discussed, Well, the guide book says its a 5.7, and that seems to be a beginners grade, for a sport climb, so they both decided it would suffice for a first lead. They both looked at each other, and wanted the other to jump on the lead.  The feisty red head blurted, You were the one who talked us into doing this crazy shit, so you can lead it, this is YOUR deal!"" The brunette gave a nervous laugh, and said, Whatever, okay.    They did all the right things with the knots, rope, and double checking each other, so off the brunette went on lead. A few dance moves up the slab, and she stopped for a second, and said, That bolt looks a little high. The red head reassured, All the climbs are probably like that. A little bit of continued smearing, and crimping that the brunette had learned from her Red Rock death scrambles, finally got her to the first bolt, and she quickly, and proudly clipped her first bolt outdoors, and ran the rope through. She took a deep breath, relieved, but now seeking reassurance from her red headed partner that she really did have her on belay, and then the brunette climbed on.     The brunette climbed a few feet above the first bolt, and the red head asked, Are you back clipped?"" The brunette didnt really want to think about it at that point, so without looking she replied, No, and climbed on very slowly. Some of this rock sounds hollow,"" the brunette said with a shaky voice, as she was clinging to a little under-cling, looking for where she should go next. Oh, theres the next bolt, okay, she had thought to herself, and with a little Elvis in her leg. Well, this is Vegas, baby.    Anyway, the second bolt was soon clipped, and the brunette felt a lot better, until she got up to a little roof. Now what? she had thought. By this time she was electively mute from being frightened, but found hope when she had blindly reached up over the bulge, and felt on some hard balls. They were small balls but when she finally had the courage to look at them, she saw that they were solid, and could be very useful to pull up over the annoying bulge, and it was even more encouraging when she had also seen another bolt nearby above her. ""Whew, that was fun,"" the brunette called down after she had pulled the move.    The proud brunette happily scampered up the easy, low angle slab with positive holds that felt similar to the scrambles in Red Rock that they both loved. She was finally smiling again, and was soon at the strange looking cold shut anchor; she clipped into it, and did all the text book things, rapped down with her tuber, and it was on!    The red head found that she didnt care too much for that kind of rock climbing after Cow Lick Co. Crag, and stuck to her power hiking, and unprotected scrambles, sold her climbing gear on ebay, and eventually moved to the island of Kauai.

It is truly a ""choose your own adventure"" type of route. If you really wanted you could make almost any crack/feature an eliminate and get more laps/climbing in. Either way, the most recognizable pitch is the large chimney that makes the 2nd pitch and summit buttress of the route.  Another stand-out feature, and possibly the crux highlight of the route is an offwidth roof (5.10-) midway on the first pitch.  This can be avoided by climbing cracks to the left that come in at about 5.7/5.8. More info below...Pitch 1 - Start to the left of a pillar that forms two corner cracks, with another finger crack/flake just to the left. Up this to a ledge, then decide if you'd like to get funky up the roof or keep it easy by heading left up the handcrack. If going left, follow another dual crack system to another good stance, then scramble up easy 5th class to the base of the wide chimney. 5.7 100'Variation - Climb the wide roof midway on Pitch 1.  Because of the ledge below the roof, it is recommended to break this into two short pitches, as to avoid a ledge fall if one comes off the roof. Get creative with the roof and continue up the offwidth to easier 5th class to the base of the large chimney.  (two #6's and #5 will be handy) 5.10- 50'Pitch 2 - The large chimney.  Probably the highlight of the route if you skipped the roof.  Squeeze into the chimney and squirm your way up, eventually getting a small nut some ways up.  Keep chimneying until you reach a slanting foot ledge/ramp inside the chimney that traverses up and into the chasm diagonally. Follow this until it ends and continue upwards to a good cam placement.  Onward to the summit... 5.8R 75'",{106974860: 2}

Good movement with high points for continuity.","{200212139: 4, 200022962: 4, 112404904: 4, 200195925: 3, 107946583: 3, 111163750: 3, 106697740: 3, 106031999: 3, 105992127: 3, 112003012: 3, 107890277: 3, 110963235: 3, 108386412: 3, 107464370: 3, 109328345: 3, 108466105: 3, 107889629: 3, 107442016: 3, 106142131: 3, 10168: 2, 10788: 2, 7130366: 2, 106974860: 2, 107841551: 2, 106554608: 2, 200147308: 2, 200093609: 2, 109266549: 2, 106681424: 2, 106372949: 2, 108248066: 2, 106558554: 2, 106708690: 2, 200173263: 2, 108437387: 2, 108886435: 2, 10382: 2, 111415956: 1, 108468640: 1}"

History: According to Wendall Broussard aka “The Dean of Red Rock,” both “Couldn’t be Schmooter“ and “High Class Ho” are both named after a French craps dealer that worked at Caesar's Palace in the 1980’s.

This may be one of the better routes at Moderate Mecca, but is not a destination climb for Red Rocks.    To find Fleet Street, first locate Scalawag. Starting from the left end of Moderate Mecca's Left side, walk back to the right to find an obvious roof crack with hands-to-off-hands jams and a few holds above the lip; this is Scalawag. Perhaps 2-3 meters still further right is a second crack system that climbs out and round the roof's right side, which is Muckraker.    Fleet Street is the relatively low-angle face just right of Muckraker. Some distance up there is a bolt, and some distance above that one, a second bolt. The climbing continues on small sloping holds, and although not difficult, is insecure. As well, the sparse protection reminds you that it's best to be careful here. Climb upward and onward, occasionally encountering a shallow crack until a ledge is reached. Rap from an anchor on that ledge 90' back to the ground.

Follow the low-angle crack/seam above (5.8) to the anchors on a small but comfortable ledge. 11 bolts, 90ft.Pitch 2, 5.10a: Climb up the easy slab following the bolts through the scoop to a crux mantle out of the scoop. Follow the low angle ledge to where the bolts continue up the vertical face through the varnish. The anchors are on the left side of the cap of rock that forms the top of the buttress. Most of the climbing on this pitch is in the 8 or 9 range except the well protected crux, 13 bolts 110ft.Descent: There are three descent options: 1) Walk off the back side of the buttress down an easy ramp and scramble down the wash back to the base. 2) Rappel the route. 3) There is a rappel line off the other side of the buttress that involves a free hanging rappel into the gulley (anchors on very top of buttress).","{107531903: 3, 200559037: 2}"

Snake Charmer,106395717,Trad,106395713,5.7,200,2,2.0,5.0,"The Snake Charmer is a fun little route that may be found on the right side of Reptile Rock.  The line ascends an obvious dogleg crack in 2-4 pitches (depending on how you do it.)    Pitch One:   Ascend third class terrain to the base of the dogleg crack (3rd 45').  Certainly this may be scrambled and not pitched out.    Pitch Two:   Climb the right trending dogleg crack.  The crux is right off the anchor -- it's a good idea to put in an anchor, because if someone blows off, you'll both take a ride down the third class terrain.  Follow the crack to a double bolt anchor at a ledge at the base of a vertical crack (70' 5.6)    Pitch Three:   Climb straight up the crack, passing an annoying tree, to the face above.  Beware the loose holds on the upper face. Pass three bolts to an anchor.  It is possible to rappel the route from here.    Pitch Four:   Optional pitch -- some may find it easier to do another short pitch to the top of the feature.      From the top of the crag, step across a small gully and climb a low angle crack to an easy descent.","{109334029: 3, 13816: 2, 200041527: 2, 107559644: 2, 106588555: 1}"

The route starts on a flat sloping rock (which slid down the gully about 5 ft in Oct 2015 during really heavy rains).    P1  5.9, 8 bs, 70 ft, for the most part is a jug haul on vertical desert varnish, 2 chained anchors.   P2  5.8, 8 bs, 80 ft, Red Rock slab climbing with a thin crux midway, 2 chained anchors.   P3  5.8, 8 bs, 70 ft, the slab soon turns vertical with more large holds to the finish, 2 chained anchors.   P4 - 5.0, 2 b's w 2 bolt anchor, no rappel rings, 30 ft, mini-pitchette for those wanting to walk off climbers left and safely get to the walk off ledge. Look up and right for the 1st bolt. Pitch is shaped like a crescent moon up and right. Anchor is directly above P3 chains.    Pitches 1 & 2 or 2 & 3 can be combined with a 60m rope and 17 draws, or combine all 3 pitches with a 70m rope and 26 draws.    Descent Options:    Preferred Descent: Walk off climbers left: climb P4 to arrive at the walk-off ledge, being very careful with all of the loose rock on the ledges. Continue south east (climbers left) until you see the gully with the tree in it and descend.

This thing felt a good bit harder than 5.9 to me... but I think it was because there were a number of massive, loose blocks and the route was super chossy.

South Calico Ridge,112487912,Trad,112487892,5.6,4100,1,3.0,1.0,"The South Calico ridge runs SE to NW in a nice setting with big views, interesting rock situations and climbing sequences, thoughtful navigation, and fairly close to trailheads.  strategy: The idea of this route is to attempt to traverse the ridge and find the most interesting climbing sections staying as close to the crest of the ridge as possible, and touch as many of its summits as possible (all about the same elevation 4320 ft).  The key difficulties along the crest of the ridge are chasms that cut across it. Sometimes the harder climbing is in getting down into the chasm, other times it's getting up out of it.  . . (A different strategy would be to avoid the more difficult chasms by going off the ridge to one side or the other: . . . . See the route South Calico Traverse).  which direction? Likely the navigation is a bit less tricky going in the SE to NW direction. Also likely the majority of the 5th class climbing is upward while going in the SE to NW direction (but still need to have some down-climbing skill and experience).  route: The terrain on and around the ridge is complicated, so it's difficult to remember and accurately describe the details. My memory from February 2017 is that there was one chasm where I had to drop down a ways off to the SE side of the ridge in order to avoid climbing substantially harder than 5.6 difficulty. And at least one high point of the ridge crest which I skipped because I did not quickly see a low 5th class way up onto it. . . (So likely there is a ""direct direct"" version of this route at difficulty greater than 5.6).  . . (Also perhaps there might be a more clever route close to the crest which holds the difficulty lower to 5.4 or 5.5 ... . . . . but perhaps Not -- or perhaps it takes more time to find that -- and . . . . perhaps miss out on some more interesting climbing sequence).  some Details ... . . . (for those who want that sort of thing). Starting from the SouthEast end of the rock of the ridge: * Got onto the rock just West (left side) from the end, with an interesting 5.3-5.4 sequence, then some hiking, then scrambled around NW (left) side of a rock nub, some more hiking, then close to the crest ... * Interesting chimney with 5.3-5.4 crux. * more hiking + scrambling up to the ""SE summit"" (N36.1453 W115.4235). * NW down from this soon to a wall, with a sustained exposed 5.4 sequence up a right-trending crack to get over it. * Looking ahead from there seemed like straightforward hiking, but then surprise encounters with chasms cutting across the way. Seemed like at least one 5.6 sequence in there somewhere. * Next reached the ""Midway summit"" (N36.1490 W115.4278). Down a nice ramp. A bit later down a short gully to the NE, immediately back up a gully SW, and * Reached the ""mid-North summit"" (N36.1502 W115.4293) - (above the popular Panty Wall sport crag). . . . (one previous time I next went down NE way off the ridge over 150 ft, then long rising traverse to get back onto ridge, but more recently was able to stay close to the ridge continuing NW). * at least one more difficult sequence in the next section. Around (N36.1506 W115.4297) went NE down a short gully, but soon got back up onto ridge crest. Then into a SW-NE running ""valley"" cutting across the crest. NW over over another bump and * reached the ""North"" summit (N36.1518 W115.4307) - (near the Ultraman sport crag). * continue NW to reach the ""Far NW"" summit (N36.1531 W115.4326) -- perhaps easiest around on its N side. . . . (If short on time, could exit early around (N36.1524 W115.4316) just E of another bump, and make a downward traverse onto the SE (right) side of the ridge (with a short sequence 5.3-5.4), then find a way E and SE on some sustained slabby rock (not many positive holds but not so steep) down to the Stairmaster Pass).  * descent from the ""Far North"" summit: At first down N, weave NW then SE, then find a down NE to reach the Stairmaster Pass (N36.1534 W115.4323).  link-up? This route could be followed by climbing the (more difficult) ""Stone Sweet Ridge"" route of Red Book Point -- or even a complete traverse of the Red Book Ridge (by then descending the ""NorthWest gully + ridge"" route to the Middle Pass).  warning: Many loose rocks and weak breakable hand- and foot-holds on and around this route - (even when the rock plenty dry).

Red Slippers,117078831,Trad,113065116,5.5,800,4,2.5,2.0,"This route has the most ""narrow exposed arete"" climbing of the SW + South ridges of Calico Peak -- plus some other interesting situations, like crossing chasms. It takes the middle of the three ridges, and (unlike before August 2019) the climbing on it is pretty well worked-out from bottom to top.  Protection is the critical deficiency. The bottom wide ridge lacks belay anchors (and perhaps could use some directionals to protect the followers from side-swing impact), and while the lower part of the main narrow ridge has anchors, the upper part of the main narrow ridge lacks belay anchors - (then the connection to the Calico Viewcap summit does have some anchors).  So until someone works out some clever careful ways to construct more trad-gear or natural anchors, or (more likely) a team puts in some labor hours and expense to install fixed-bolt-hardware anchors, most of this route must be regarded as interesting Free Solo.  context: There are three South ridges for Calico Peak [see Photo]. The most prominent from the Red Rock Scenic Loop road is the left (W) one [see the route SouthWest Ridge], which goes up directly to the south ViewCap (N36.1585 W115.4380) - (which is not the highest summit) - and it requires more difficult climbing to get onto it near its bottom.

Stone Sweet Ridge,113108574,Trad,113065116,5.6,750,1,2.7,3.0,"The main (east) south ridge of Calico Peak rises up above the Stone Wall and Sweet Pain sport crags. And its stone climbs sweet - [ see GPS track on Map ].  Lots of interesting climbing in a variety of situations (much on ridges). . . . Also a significant percentage of the approach and descent offers additional interesting scrambling situations. . . . Variations offer choices of different rock situations or short sequences of easier or harder moves.  The 5.6 and 5.5 moves can be avoided (at least by the followers), keeping the overall difficulty more like 5.4.  Three main climbing sections with some walking in between. Often the last section to the true east summit is skipped, because the lower south ViewCap is so nice. Or those feeling tired can stop after the first main section and still have gotten lots of interesting climbing even without reaching the ViewCap.  context: This route (with alternate start down from Middle Pass) fits well into a ""grand traverse"" of the Calico Ridges S to N. Or a less-long ridge traverse from the 2nd Pull-Out parking: first hike/scramble up to Stairmaster Pass, next traverse Red Book Point summit and ridges from S to N to reach Frostie Shack Pass, then S Ridge + S Groove to Calico Peak, and descend SE Gully and back to 2PO parking.  Climbing only the Lower + Middle parts with finish to the south ViewCap makes a varied exciting shorter outing.  There are three South ridges for Calico Peak [see Photo]. The most prominent from the Red Rock Scenic Loop road is the left (W) one [see the route SW Ridge], which goes up directly to the south ViewCap (N36.1585 W115.4380) - (which is not the highest summit) - and it requires more difficult climbing to get onto it near its bottom. The right (E) one aims more at the two highest summits of Calico Peak, but has some ups and downs along the way. There is also a ridge in between these two with some rather interesting climbing / scrambling [see the route Red Slippers]. This route is for the right one. Since it is easiest to get onto near its bottom, has the most interesting climbing, and aims most directly at the highest summit, makes sense to think of it as the ""main"" S ridge of Calico Peak.  equipment: Tight-fitting technical rock-climbing shoes are not needed, because very few moves depend on stepping on small edges. But many moves stepping on slopy footholds, so a sticky-rubber rock-climbing style sole on a well-designed climbing-oriented approach shoe is valuable.  Using Trad gear to ""fill in"" the long runout sections of the lower part is unknown. Many climbers with lots of outdoor experience are well-capable of solo-ing this route in approach shoes (except for the risk of a hold breaking).  Three quickdraws and a single 40-meter rope sufficient for leading (thoughj 40-meter is not sufficient for rappelling, which is not recommended anyway). Might want to bring a ""trad draw"" with extendable runner/sling for the second intermediate bolt on the Pitch 7 of the Lower part. Perhaps a long sling for the natural anchors at the tops of pitch 1 and pitch 2.  Hiking poles (collapsable) useful for approach and descent.

Where ""direct"" progress seems blocked, usually it's easiest to bypass them below on the left (NE) side of the ridge.   descent:   Easier to descent the SSW face (or WSW face?) of Tank Peak, then return to Sandstone Quarry parking by the maintained Calico Tanks trail.","{108337488: 3, 106942612: 2}"

Then the ""white gully"" has lots of nice scrambling, less obstructed by vegetation than might guess from below. Next on a wide ridge on white rock up to the red summit cap (with no easy way on or off).    Two crux sections much more difficult than the rest -- short and not very exposed, but a slip could result in a broken ankle. Might be more difficult getting back down than going up -- so study carefully before committing to going up.    Shoes with high-friction rubber useful (for slopy holds), but real ""rock climbing"" shoes (for serious edging) not necessary.    Though the shortest approach is from Sandstone Quarry parking, this route could also be reached from Calico Basin parking (outside the Red Rock Scenic Loop road).    More photos and different detail on SummitPost.org.   details:   Up the gully, with the unvegetated rock mainly on the left (E) side. Pretty sustained with lots of slopy holds.

From here it's another 0.1 mile (150 meters) SouthEast (left) on a wide ridge crest to the summit cap. But first there is ...    the problem of getting up over a wall -- not tall, but not with positive holds on or above. The ""cheaters"" way is to notice some rocks stacked on top of a pine tree. The climbers way (5.3) is to notice to the right (SW) of the tree some slopy holds going up diagonal right. Either way, an injury from slipping or a stacked rock collapsing is likely going to result in a very difficult exit and a long unhappy finish to the day.   Also good to think hard now about how you're going to get down this later coming back - (might be scarier and more difficult).    . . (There is a report with photos on SummitPost.org of another way - ? down the other side ? South ? - that avoids this wall).    Once past this, hike about 400 feet SouthEast along the broad crest of the ridge to almost reach the red summit cap. There might be water in the depression (tinaja) just below / before (NW from) the cap.    Next big problem is to get up onto the to the cap. The least-difficult way is to find on its west side a short vertical groove (5.3) - to the right of the tinaja. The sequence to get up it take some thought. Perhaps even more thought to climb back down it, so might want to practice that now while it's still fresh on your mind. Not real tall, but breaking an ankle would make for a long unhappy finish to the day.   - - > There is no easy way down off the summit cap.    . . variation: There is a fun overhang finish (5.6) up onto the cap a few feet to the left. But still a good idea to first check out the sequence up and down the groove, since down-climbing the overhang is surely harder.   descent:   Going back the same way is the simplest route-finding, likely also the least difficult climbing.   . .

Red Cap Ridge,113121085,Trad,113075401,5.4,3400,1,3.0,1.0,"The idea is to traverse the ridge of Red Cap from SouthEast to Northwest. Lots of interesting 5th and 4th and 3rd class climbing and scrambling, with lots of big views. Not so far from the road (Sandstone Quarry parking).    Fits well into a ""grand traverse"" of the Calico Hills ridges.    Since the SE end of the Red Cap ridge is at Tank Peak, first need to climb that summit. The NW end of the ridge finishes with a drop-off (which would be much more difficult ciimbing than the rest of the route), so instead finish by descending the N Gully of Red Cap.   route up SE side to Red Cap summit:   Reach the SouthEast end of the ridge by first climbing to the summit of Tank Peak, either by the SSW face route (more ridge-y) or the WSW face route (shorter).    From the summit of Tank Peak, go about 1800 ft (0.35 mile) generally NorthWest along the ridge to around (N36.1654 W115.4418).

Where ""direct"" progress seems blocked, usually it's easiest to bypass them below on the right (NE) side of the ridge.    Next comes some complicated navigation to get to the summit of Red Cap. The obstacle is a chasm on the SE side of the summit cap. So    ... from the ridge crest around (N36.1654 W115.4418) about 300 feet SE from the summit ...   Bear left off the left side of the ridge about 150 feet W + WNW. See a gully (or two) above right. Aim for the bottom of the (right) gully - around (N36.1658 W115.4421) - go about 120 feet NE. Next bear left and scramble up this gully NW about 25 feet. Then exit this gully left and traverse WNW to reach another gully.    Scramble up this second gully 130 feet generally North, then up another 40 feet W + NW to reach the high point of the chasm cutting through the ridge on the SE side of the cap -- now roughly ENE from Red Cap summit at around (N36.1661 W115.4425).

Hike down about 400 feet NorthWest along the broad crest of the ridge until blocked by a wide gully whose side wall is rather steep and perhaps lacking positive holds.    The puzzle is how to get down into the gully without getting hurt. The ""cheaters"" way is to notice some rocks stacked on top of a pine tree. The climbers way (5.3) is to notice to SW of the tree some slopy holds going down diagonally toward NE.    Once down in the gully, get near the crest of the ridge and find the narrow top of the North gully -- which below soon gets wider, with white rock showing especially on its right (E) side.    . . Ridge aficionados can continue past this key gully about 200 feet NW then N to visit the steep drop-off at the N - NW end of the Red Cap ridge, then return to the top of the North Gully.    Scramble N down the gully, with the unvegetated white rock mainly on the right (E) side. Pretty sustained with lots of slopy holds.    Continuing about 50-100 feet N from the bottom of the gully, meet an unmarked trail around (N36.1685 W115.4442) (perhaps this trail comes from the east from Calico Basin parking?). Can use this to help go Left a short ways West.     But the main idea is to go around below the NW side of Red Cap, not using a trail but rather finding the main ""wash"" (gravel streambed) and mostly following that 0.3 mile at first SW then WSW  - (likely will find it easier to get out of the wash on its left SE side for at least one section) - until meet the main (unmarked) Calico Tanks trail around (N36.1666 W115.4484).    Hike on this trail 0.4 mile gentle W then SW then S, back to Sandstone Quarry parking.   warning: Many loose rocks and weak breakable hand- and foot-holds on and around this route - (even when the rock plenty dry). The rock becomes especially weak for a couple of days after significant rain or snow, so holds are even more likely to break off.",{106942612: 3}

Definitely must have been others who have done it before, but adding it because it's such a perfect moderate route with already placed chains for easy rap.

Remember, pull down and not out and don't climb when the rock is wet.  One would hate to contribute to the destruction of such an amazing climbing area.    Below the main wall, a flat ledge narrows and angles upwards the farther right you go.  It eventually opens up again below a lower angled portion of the face which allows 4th class access to set up tope ropes above.  Silk Panties starts midway up the narrow up-angling portion of the ledge and passes 5 bolts to a 3 bolt anchor.

While in the book as 2 pitches, I did not find the belay to be inspiring and was climbing with a novice at the time, so I chose to run to the top, to near the end of my 70M rope. This worked well, and he didn't mind the potential rope stretch so much as the thought of hanging on small gear in soft stone.    From the crack which splits the center of the Tuna and Chips wall ('Tuna Cookies', 5.7) walk up and left around some shrubs for 7 meters to reach a starting point on the left side of the face with good holds... and a few bolts. Climb more or less straight up on small edges and crimps past 3 bolts to a small crack, then up and onward again to the rounded top of the wall. The belay up top is reasonably secure, but may require (if memory serves) a long cordalette or webbing if you want to sit up at the edge to watch your second.    This is a fun line and will provide good climbing for a party competent to lead it. For the second, be aware of rope stretch potential, but really the climbing is straightforward and simple. Both my beginner friend and I enjoyed it.    Edit to add:  Another user comments on the belay opportunity:   ""After the last bolt it's about 20 feet to a good cam placement. Above this there is an obvious finger crack splitting the upper slab. Belay here on good medium cams and stoppers. Belay is good but semi-hanging. Stone is surprisingly good for the belay.""

If you proceed left through the huecos the climbing is easier, but more reachy; proceed to the right, and you have a few harder moves but they are very straight forward.","{105891238: 4, 107464864: 4, 106819472: 4, 106999805: 4, 111284682: 4, 111585366: 4, 108904483: 4, 107533223: 4, 108856432: 4, 111372813: 4, 110965145: 4, 107593049: 4, 200145674: 4, 109140350: 4, 110970969: 4, 108030216: 4, 111872966: 4, 112059446: 4, 200437216: 4, 200359801: 4, 200743333: 4, 200145349: 4, 200101910: 4, 107070954: 3, 106055734: 3, 106741416: 3, 107002874: 3, 105817062: 3, 106555971: 3, 105916328: 3, 10382: 3, 107326021: 3, 107748911: 3, 105871767: 3, 107069370: 3, 107356939: 3, 107765496: 3, 108023481: 3, 107301514: 3, 107545719: 3, 106303677: 3, 106400271: 3, 106540505: 3, 106522843: 3, 106048386: 3, 106351162: 3, 106774751: 3, 106806991: 3, 106705516: 3, 106347294: 3, 105994004: 3, 106554608: 3, 106974860: 3, 106386195: 3, 14248: 3, 105963968: 3, 108057626: 3, 108121368: 3, 108087433: 3, 108091988: 3, 107554754: 3, 106697740: 3, 107117061: 3, 107257835: 3, 107043617: 3, 108785124: 3, 107589858: 3, 108702790: 3, 106852393: 3, 108542105: 3, 106803961: 3, 107929813: 3, 108065923: 3, 107654077: 3, 107534146: 3, 108762582: 3, 108491912: 3, 110217587: 3, 107985072: 3, 108465688: 3, 111359927: 3, 108419580: 3, 109645277: 3, 107323577: 3, 110225247: 3, 111746759: 3, 110315255: 3, 11591: 3, 107521989: 3, 110192825: 3, 111252595: 3, 108331469: 3, 109513381: 3, 112323726: 3, 107968558: 3, 107000115: 3, 105908890: 3, 108295148: 3, 112826724: 3, 107870857: 3, 111833511: 3, 105801073: 3, 200063475: 3, 108322996: 3, 111670150: 3, 110729900: 3, 112078683: 3, 108222837: 3, 111920334: 3, 200068984: 3, 112212753: 3, 111359086: 3, 111239574: 3, 111670286: 3, 200173263: 3, 200202844: 3, 200198879: 3, 112023123: 3, 200059845: 3, 200163959: 3, 109180494: 3, 200281073: 3, 110956309: 3, 109648338: 3, 112105385: 3, 107890277: 3, 200433701: 3, 108386412: 3, 112174414: 3, 112370412: 3, 200211321: 3, 106116385: 3, 11331: 3, 109554938: 3, 200217095: 3, 200254965: 3, 200094340: 3, 200520993: 3, 200540606: 3, 107987371: 3, 112295616: 3, 112116113: 3, 200840464: 3, 200280192: 3, 200423063: 3, 111347304: 3, 107612260: 3, 200170142: 3, 112054084: 3, 107588602: 3, 200760174: 3, 111161104: 3, 106930760: 2, 106020445: 2, 106444007: 2, 106758324: 2, 107846290: 2, 13937: 2, 106782439: 2, 106434221: 2, 107138810: 2, 107153125: 2, 107792163: 2, 107783414: 2, 106076447: 2, 108177813: 2, 108816190: 2, 107663850: 2, 105807147: 2, 10168: 2, 108266520: 2, 108647959: 2, 108032974: 2, 109033018: 2, 107116940: 2, 107779884: 2, 110822578: 2, 108277411: 2, 110459813: 2, 108983186: 2, 112823251: 2, 108410463: 2, 110904756: 2, 112096428: 2, 109521445: 2, 109692317: 2, 109424881: 2, 111896676: 2, 110592577: 2, 110750765: 2, 107011842: 2, 106372949: 2, 107400819: 2, 200350656: 2, 111737073: 2, 112386936: 2, 111971885: 2, 107152512: 2, 109083004: 2, 200311173: 2, 111812689: 2, 200278987: 2, 107878003: 1, 108401191: 1}"

Climb the easy holds up to the third bolts and then crimp your way to a great left handed undercling. This will require smearing you feet on the way up.

The crux involves a balancy corner about a third of the way up, and right below a small roofed edge.    The numeric name comes from the fact that it is a 7 bolt 5.7, and a section of a 2x4 plank was used to assist in the anchoring while the route was bolted.    **Note: One concern is that the anchors are set back behind the top of the climb, creating a lot of friction on the rope as you lower off. For very small climbers (kids) it can be almost impossible to get enough weight on the rope to get them back to the ground, resulting in some forceful down climbing.  As there are already numerous links on the chains above, the only likely solution would be to add another anchor bolt below the current anchors to reduce the rope drag.","{107461378: 4, 110312676: 4, 111163750: 4, 109092361: 4, 107536111: 4, 105890157: 4, 200488374: 4, 107154237: 4, 105817062: 3, 107572371: 3, 105801857: 3, 14098: 3, 107553463: 3, 105960717: 3, 107583642: 3, 107554754: 3, 107890277: 3, 106129363: 3, 106315188: 3, 106310836: 3, 106804138: 3, 106351162: 3, 106601971: 3, 106903881: 3, 106758324: 3, 107375962: 3, 106405531: 3, 105807147: 3, 106494476: 3, 107410756: 3, 107758055: 3, 108123128: 3, 107025325: 3, 108091067: 3, 107928417: 3, 107923457: 3, 108708700: 3, 108625148: 3, 109570682: 3, 109021811: 3, 108676969: 3, 109277437: 3, 106649121: 3, 110044455: 3, 106341443: 3, 109151895: 3, 110963235: 3, 110946269: 3, 110763740: 3, 111356306: 3, 109076559: 3, 107233302: 3, 111816786: 3, 110834596: 3, 106743502: 3, 112116128: 3, 112299780: 3, 105860008: 3, 112528646: 3, 111886893: 3, 108189980: 3, 112411053: 3, 109948410: 3, 110177459: 3, 108254193: 3, 112430708: 3, 200148182: 3, 200089710: 3, 111096280: 3, 200174103: 3, 200189833: 3, 109854270: 3, 200056643: 3, 108300756: 3, 112449870: 3, 200155559: 3, 7117535: 3, 108628649: 3, 110965145: 3, 200289114: 3, 111321602: 3, 200272142: 3, 111987917: 3, 200059845: 3, 109222097: 3, 109585594: 3, 200334588: 3, 110787439: 3, 200067312: 3, 200192280: 3, 108280591: 3, 112293455: 3, 200103187: 3, 200242710: 3, 200302724: 3, 200334705: 3, 200511155: 3, 200442430: 3, 200625337: 3, 200678274: 3, 200741505: 3, 200612535: 3, 200152964: 3, 200038210: 3, 200711171: 3, 200101910: 3, 200243062: 3, 110152429: 3, 107115089: 2, 107002874: 2, 106237951: 2, 106200408: 2, 106827872: 2, 107349767: 2, 105900841: 2, 105914540: 2, 107576336: 2, 11591: 2, 105997456: 2, 107295479: 2, 107451199: 2, 107704803: 2, 106257523: 2, 106377649: 2, 106009899: 2, 106824315: 2, 106081147: 2, 107889753: 2, 106088934: 2, 107831706: 2, 108023481: 2, 106018260: 2, 105797645: 2, 106379528: 2, 106133387: 2, 106514333: 2, 106522843: 2, 105822976: 2, 106048386: 2, 106622959: 2, 106782439: 2, 106280199: 2, 106705516: 2, 106683764: 2, 105871395: 2, 107230627: 2, 106554608: 2, 105846944: 2, 106226365: 2, 105963968: 2, 107875596: 2, 107858706: 2, 107325943: 2, 106974860: 2, 107134664: 2, 106697740: 2, 107894727: 2, 108261555: 2, 107821937: 2, 107680316: 2, 108122275: 2, 108141805: 2, 108416920: 2, 107803888: 2, 106571266: 2, 108389474: 2, 108048090: 2, 106838734: 2, 108735409: 2, 106630015: 2, 107689317: 2, 109305114: 2, 107442963: 2, 109212991: 2, 107929813: 2, 106195833: 2, 107534146: 2, 110217587: 2, 110209164: 2, 110685425: 2, 106662993: 2, 110195350: 2, 110577142: 2, 111030895: 2, 111322443: 2, 107435323: 2, 10168: 2, 109943766: 2, 108381948: 2, 111656243: 2, 107042723: 2, 107116332: 2, 106463225: 2, 109527528: 2, 111665201: 2, 111806754: 2, 110937405: 2, 110080172: 2, 110192825: 2, 107153125: 2, 108981414: 2, 111900208: 2, 111848939: 2, 108436633: 2, 111757042: 2, 111350357: 2, 106596992: 2, 110831889: 2, 112078683: 2, 110220158: 2, 108015415: 2, 107216693: 2, 109153442: 2, 111910551: 2, 108406663: 2, 112250778: 2, 108601850: 2, 200068094: 2, 110536605: 2, 106116385: 2, 109692317: 2, 200083510: 2, 112426189: 2, 112410461: 2, 110878282: 2, 111914207: 2, 110457315: 2, 106306579: 2, 108234286: 2, 105859360: 2, 200241582: 2, 106962670: 2, 110750765: 2, 110592577: 2, 110041508: 2, 200198010: 2, 200085637: 2, 200065408: 2, 110767228: 2, 112105385: 2, 7074784: 2, 112383380: 2, 200034945: 2, 200165817: 2, 106822110: 2, 110970969: 2, 106372949: 2, 109015980: 2, 105795302: 2, 112035468: 2, 110298630: 2, 111991113: 2, 110909700: 2, 109571658: 2, 200392723: 2, 112392255: 2, 200070835: 2, 200822567: 2, 200953222: 2, 106744344: 1, 105964496: 1, 107544688: 1, 107878003: 1, 107748312: 1, 106150571: 1, 107301514: 1, 107348218: 1, 108127987: 1, 106397969: 1, 107839970: 1, 107318493: 1, 108195060: 1, 106518393: 1, 108270440: 1, 109823981: 1, 110054827: 1, 108130186: 1, 110711271: 1, 111833511: 1, 107011842: 1, 111454181: 1, 109280064: 1, 112232712: 1, 110618917: 1, 107600470: 1, 111670150: 1, 200007471: 1, 105892004: 1, 110452690: 1, 111525178: 1, 110185189: 1, 200284087: 1, 200175067: 1, 200817106: 1, 200760174: 1, 107459332: 0}"

The Gift,105732371,Sport,105731999,5.12d,70,1,3.7,103.0,"One of the best and most famous hard-12 sport climbs in North America.  It's been called 12c for years, but most of the current guidebooks now rate it 12d.  This is an awesome, steep, strenuous route, involving thuggish climbing to a delicate crux at the very end.      Much of the climbing in the lower section would probably clock in at about 12a/b.  The crux, involving a technical high step and reach to an elusive pebble, is not that hard in of itself, but the precision required for this move is usually hard to come by after the pumpy climbing below.  For those who project in this grade range, the key to the redpoint is to ruthlessly wire the lower section so that one can arrive at the crux fresh.    On a sunny winter day, one can enjoyably spend the afternoon watching numerous people cruising the lower section only to be spit off by the crux, again and again and again.","{10315: 4, 12075: 4, 106693919: 4, 105787473: 4, 105817062: 4, 106441684: 4, 106006184: 4, 105846604: 4, 15043: 4, 106194391: 4, 10116: 4, 106202599: 4, 105975214: 4, 106207441: 4, 106404987: 4, 14152: 4, 106389004: 4, 106951875: 4, 106271741: 4, 107830214: 4, 105985185: 4, 10168: 4, 108996063: 4, 105979363: 4, 109495327: 4, 106649121: 4, 107650191: 4, 106159111: 4, 106859002: 4, 108552057: 4, 110171029: 4, 109392078: 4, 107878550: 4, 108468640: 4, 108824777: 4, 106983776: 4, 107016978: 4, 111442565: 4, 106741742: 4, 112267364: 4, 106517269: 4, 106119395: 4, 106195490: 4, 111623347: 4, 111256590: 4, 109649642: 4, 106139678: 4, 7042780: 4, 107521255: 4, 106506620: 4, 107938599: 4, 107574666: 4, 107085584: 4, 200189526: 4, 108091273: 4, 111373936: 4, 113374239: 4, 106220386: 4, 200454934: 4, 109881129: 4, 111585366: 4, 109564564: 4, 111649446: 4, 111235518: 4, 200246689: 4, 108043082: 4, 110752881: 4, 107608977: 4, 200212139: 4, 200785460: 4, 106838734: 4, 112532915: 4, 107684774: 4, 109425692: 4, 7056718: 4, 11228: 3, 105787222: 3, 105802320: 3, 105849172: 3, 106104499: 3, 106460502: 3, 105806690: 3, 106048386: 3, 105990845: 3, 15142: 3, 106974860: 3, 107580987: 3, 106498738: 3, 107985325: 3, 106646308: 3, 11509: 3, 109277227: 3, 106325793: 3, 200146694: 3, 112851513: 3, 112169632: 3, 109101477: 3, 200400067: 3, 109868740: 3, 108043324: 3, 200049399: 3, 10232: 2, 111841723: 2}"

The location of this climb is obvious.  It more or less climbs the giant left facing dihedral, aka The Great Red Book...    P1 (5.8): Climb up past a few vegetated ledges and work over into the corner proper for about 10-15 ft.  When the crack becomes too thin, head back out onto the face and up to the bolted anchor where a memorial for Randall has been scratched into the rock (technically this is a chipped route :)    P2 (5.8 PG): Climb up the face on small edges past 2 bolts and lieback around the OW in the corner.  Shoot for the top via the face or chimney.

From there things can get a bit nebulous. An easier bolted obvious line is to keep trending right up to an easy to spot anchor station shared with Dangling Participles. A second pitch (5.6) then goes 100 ft up to anchor in a cave. There is also a seeming bolt line that goes straight up after the first bolt on pitch one to a second older type bolt. I tried to follow that line but it seemed to peter out and once I was way to high above any kind of pro I ended up downclimbing and traversing right to the other line. Maybe I missed something so have it if you want!

Stone Hammer,106738092,Trad,105732120,5.8,200,1,1.0,5.0,"Start up a right-leaning seam to a high 1st bolt.  The crux is finding a stance to place a cam before that bolt.

Trend up left of the shallow alcove that marks the end of the ""Seams Novel"" route, marked by a chained rap station.    I sort of lost the Stone Hammer here, and it appears that things might have changed since Handren's description (2007:292-293).  Handren may have the topo plotted too far left (?).  There are supposed to be 2 more bolts that lead to the top, but the only other bolt I found was about 25 feet directly above the Seams Novel rap anchors.  Now, the current Seams Novel rap anchors are about 10-15 feet left of the location shown by Handren, so maybe the original 2nd bolt location for Stone Hammer has been taken over by the Seams Novel anchor, and the bolt I saw directly above that is the old 3rd bolt for Stone Hammer?  Confusing, I know.   Anyway, past the last bolt, runout climbing on brittle ledges takes one to a gear anchor in a seam at a rope-stretching 60 m, just below the summit.

Climb up an awkward start (perhaps 5.9?) and reach the first bolt. Then up and to a second bolt before angling up and left to join Technicolor Sunrise, clipping the final bolt and anchors of that route. The line is note as nice nor as continuous as the others at the cliff, and felt awkward at the bottom.    Like its neighbor, the Swain book suggests that a TCU or small wires will assist at the base, but I don't recall inspiring protection - I remember awkwardly trying to place a piece that wasn't great in the end anyway. I'd advise to just boulder it out to the first bolt and would not advise this as a good route for a blooming leader.","{108091067: 3, 106903881: 3, 106784621: 3, 109340087: 3, 110181635: 2, 10481: 2, 107762552: 2, 105787348: 2, 106681424: 2, 106601971: 2, 106764511: 2, 106683764: 2, 105941791: 2, 106435914: 2, 109585732: 2, 109649642: 2, 109392078: 2, 107085584: 2, 105795302: 2, 200187164: 2, 200078679: 2, 110402551: 2, 106860947: 2, 111342263: 2, 108584079: 2, 107652586: 2, 109048457: 2, 106656746: 2, 107390765: 2, 110362807: 2, 106096353: 2, 108023481: 2, 14098: 2, 11591: 2, 105906559: 2, 105794390: 2, 111905416: 2, 107572777: 2, 105929502: 2, 105922116: 2, 105863852: 2, 10185: 2, 105812457: 2, 107890277: 2, 107554754: 2, 107588101: 2, 105990845: 2, 106874601: 2, 107992064: 2, 106398812: 2, 107342926: 2, 105951192: 1, 110530156: 1, 14015: 1, 107519230: 1, 111816786: 1, 107323577: 1, 106081147: 1, 10232: 1, 105801857: 1, 112078683: 1, 14213: 1, 106018444: 1, 106553289: 1, 107301514: 1, 106411326: 1, 106225792: 1, 106974389: 1, 106554608: 1, 106128017: 1, 107405626: 1, 108361107: 1, 106055829: 1, 105964496: 1, 107377680: 1, 107153125: 1, 105846944: 1, 108121087: 1, 107134757: 0}"

At one time the bolt hangers were red, and still may well be.","{108016252: 4, 106492129: 4, 109891415: 4, 109145003: 4, 109704780: 4, 110054827: 4, 110919861: 4, 109188550: 4, 112775974: 4, 112792557: 4, 200160322: 4, 200144283: 4, 111895157: 4, 112297981: 4, 200221787: 4, 200219620: 4, 7036783: 4, 107390765: 4, 112383380: 4, 110428332: 4, 200436408: 4, 200132295: 4, 107290327: 3, 14015: 3, 105787348: 3, 11591: 3, 106506620: 3, 107572777: 3, 10762: 3, 105812457: 3, 106726952: 3, 107606573: 3, 107605726: 3, 107572371: 3, 10185: 3, 106176621: 3, 105863852: 3, 107553463: 3, 10481: 3, 105929502: 3, 107474229: 3, 105964496: 3, 106055829: 3, 107554754: 3, 12293: 3, 106664344: 3, 105896749: 3, 106100991: 3, 107783937: 3, 107902567: 3, 106006184: 3, 106268558: 3, 106225792: 3, 107636562: 3, 106913698: 3, 106254332: 3, 106347294: 3, 10788: 3, 106756364: 3, 106213339: 3, 106398812: 3, 106133387: 3, 106522843: 3, 105814982: 3, 106607219: 3, 106627248: 3, 105846944: 3, 106804138: 3, 106657189: 3, 106553289: 3, 106152309: 3, 106697740: 3, 106536997: 3, 106468895: 3, 107348218: 3, 106058154: 3, 108125580: 3, 107758055: 3, 106202961: 3, 108506705: 3, 108091067: 3, 108718416: 3, 107178013: 3, 107548992: 3, 107178132: 3, 107192325: 3, 108659936: 3, 106096353: 3, 106567319: 3, 108118179: 3, 108142594: 3, 109014244: 3, 108702790: 3, 109881922: 3, 108088424: 3, 108852723: 3, 107080237: 3, 109823981: 3, 109585732: 3, 110963235: 3, 107159816: 3, 110125608: 3, 111288572: 3, 110047909: 3, 110518768: 3, 109922291: 3, 110239629: 3, 109132699: 3, 107342057: 3, 110946269: 3, 111418963: 3, 107761738: 3, 107134757: 3, 107042723: 3, 109212068: 3, 110869349: 3, 109340087: 3, 107022803: 3, 111252595: 3, 111599770: 3, 110459813: 3, 112539593: 3, 200053243: 3, 111256590: 3, 110536605: 3, 112341274: 3, 111757042: 3, 200040708: 3, 7045170: 3, 105890911: 3, 111041954: 3, 111914207: 3, 200182656: 3, 108341962: 3, 110457315: 3, 110402551: 3, 110896256: 3, 111372813: 3, 112793085: 3, 200232158: 3, 108628649: 3, 200187164: 3, 105795302: 3, 110152429: 3, 200390508: 3, 109648338: 3, 200211321: 3, 110756813: 3, 109468689: 3, 200410411: 3, 200427072: 3, 200086994: 3, 110454201: 3, 110967113: 3, 106596992: 3, 106822110: 3, 200299483: 3, 11331: 3, 112035468: 3, 110200383: 3, 110298630: 3, 200567096: 3, 105832216: 3, 112878807: 3, 110530156: 3, 200326525: 3, 112186449: 3, 200175067: 3, 111791264: 3, 200172373: 3, 200463882: 3, 200624878: 3, 200168968: 3, 200272767: 3, 200903066: 3, 105951192: 2, 10168: 2, 10232: 2, 107535270: 2, 105787493: 2, 14098: 2, 105790272: 2, 105794390: 2, 107099202: 2, 105801857: 2, 107631412: 2, 107654576: 2, 13318: 2, 105789759: 2, 105922116: 2, 105999140: 2, 106299993: 2, 105906559: 2, 107595718: 2, 106784621: 2, 107053390: 2, 107890277: 2, 106088934: 2, 107588101: 2, 106987273: 2, 105990845: 2, 107917541: 2, 107368416: 2, 107831706: 2, 107457024: 2, 106086757: 2, 108023481: 2, 107884234: 2, 14595: 2, 105799633: 2, 106296252: 2, 105998198: 2, 106253603: 2, 105892730: 2, 106310836: 2, 106158835: 2, 106535625: 2, 106018444: 2, 106617437: 2, 106028814: 2, 106435914: 2, 105941791: 2, 106518393: 2, 106280199: 2, 106411326: 2, 106731930: 2, 105986261: 2, 106903881: 2, 106683764: 2, 105899248: 2, 106764511: 2, 106974389: 2, 106303677: 2, 107296299: 2, 106554608: 2, 107301514: 2, 106974860: 2, 106601971: 2, 106681424: 2, 107475857: 2, 108033421: 2, 12988: 2, 106237951: 2, 108233790: 2, 107471163: 2, 107405626: 2, 108416200: 2, 107561676: 2, 106379824: 2, 108059981: 2, 107989551: 2, 108346369: 2, 105829570: 2, 108389474: 2, 108073007: 2, 107664633: 2, 107992064: 2, 109881930: 2, 107638654: 2, 108363077: 2, 109018466: 2, 110362807: 2, 108225228: 2, 107414542: 2, 109392078: 2, 110254579: 2, 110948697: 2, 111065940: 2, 106656746: 2, 109048457: 2, 112116128: 2, 106095990: 2, 106838734: 2, 110841071: 2, 14213: 2, 107652586: 2, 106780021: 2, 109127888: 2, 110580188: 2, 111003869: 2, 108584079: 2, 106210225: 2, 111096280: 2, 109527528: 2, 112256990: 2, 200075761: 2, 112229507: 2, 112826452: 2, 200068094: 2, 111700011: 2, 109424881: 2, 106860947: 2, 110878282: 2, 107521255: 2, 106426493: 2, 109609107: 2, 105946742: 2, 108300756: 2, 200078679: 2, 109811571: 2, 111704014: 2, 112078683: 2, 200074903: 2, 111670150: 2, 112318210: 2, 107085584: 2, 110181635: 2, 110230805: 2, 108200547: 2, 200364704: 2, 200374524: 2, 106945872: 2, 110331339: 2, 200449836: 2, 12023: 2, 110383761: 2, 108752039: 2, 200267777: 2, 7104073: 2, 107987371: 2, 200066719: 2, 107054992: 1, 107451199: 1, 105829161: 1, 107365491: 1, 106128017: 1, 107878003: 1, 107552577: 1, 107539963: 1, 106514333: 1, 108436633: 1, 106271035: 1, 107377680: 1, 107153125: 1, 108236363: 1, 111816786: 1, 107323577: 1, 106081147: 1, 111905416: 1, 111841723: 1, 112526509: 1, 108981414: 1, 106981917: 1, 106354287: 1, 108055282: 0, 108127987: 0}"

Technicolor Sunrise,105732335,Sport,105732027,5.8,70,1,2.3,254.0,"To find this route first locate Neon Sunset, as described on this site.     From Neon Sunset, walk 3 meters right to a set of thin cracks tending up and right (Zipperhead) then 2 more meters to the left edge of a pyramid like feature.     Climb up on this then straight up the wall passing (5 bolts, now that it was retrobolted...) to reach a fixed anchor. The line is pretty straight and continuous and is a nice climb.    According to the Swain book, this route will take small wires at the base, but I don't recall inspiring protection and instead just bouldered it out with a spot from my belayer.

If you do this via the “normal” start the route is going to check in at 5.12. The only way to keep it at 5.11 (maybe...) is to start with a wild leap directly to the jug above the third bolt. It doesn’t seem possible but it goes!  This route is really fun but I have to dock it a star for poor engineering: The placement of the anchor creates an arbitrary clipping crux at the end (though the final moves are good)... But worse is the fact that every bolt save for one are spinners or loose in their holes. This tells me these holes were not cleaned properly and/or the bolts were not tightened properly. This route would be a good candidate for glue-ins.,{10168: 2}

This really seems like a sweet boulder problem that continues up through a series of juggy heucos to the anchors. Be sure you are solid in clipping the third bolt, as there is a potential for a groundfall if your belayer isn't proficient. Most people I've seen climb the route stick-clip the first two bolts for protection. The crux moves earn the grade for the climb, yet after the crux it is more like 5.10 climbing. Word has it that the first ascensionist would do a ""superman"" dive from the elevated bushes behind the route to the jug rail as an alternative start. Kudos to Dan!! I tried this on toprope.

Near the far right end of the Sweet Pain wall there is a big rounded bowl inset into the wall.    Climb up and into the bowl of rock, clipping one bolt. Reportedly this route can be done at 5.10a by moving right, up and then back left to the second bolt, but this seemed broken-up and less of a natural line to me. As well, I watched a 5'2"" partner try to pink-point the route this way, and she was unable to get to a good stance to clip the second bolt this way, eventually electing to pass the crux, then clip it below.     Climbing up and left for the first few bolts felt like insecure 5.10c, but was a better and probably safer line. Climb past 3 more bolts on easier terrain to the fixed anchor on top of the route.     This is not a good line to push your limits on.","{107092072: 4, 106975876: 4, 107604888: 4, 108254193: 4, 106554608: 3, 108541081: 3, 107254662: 3, 106910356: 3, 108708700: 3, 108381164: 3, 109551617: 3, 109385864: 3, 107116940: 3, 111252595: 3, 200241390: 3, 109913807: 3, 109424881: 3, 109811571: 3, 200053243: 3, 111685256: 3, 200401898: 3, 14305: 3, 200159225: 3, 200272142: 3, 200477699: 3, 112296561: 3, 107117061: 3, 112117428: 3, 106347294: 2, 106785304: 2, 106889918: 2, 107765496: 2, 106974860: 2, 106379824: 2, 105953019: 2, 105872158: 2, 107130978: 2, 107820434: 2, 14595: 2, 107015796: 2, 108121087: 2, 106498738: 2, 108780591: 2, 107442963: 2, 106649121: 2, 106744940: 2, 109124792: 2, 109258734: 2, 108358112: 2, 110365118: 2, 106031999: 2, 107654077: 2, 109392078: 2, 110690111: 2, 107464370: 2, 112296835: 2, 109227512: 2, 110494556: 2, 106838734: 2, 106662918: 2, 109393259: 2, 109609107: 2, 108142594: 2, 110315255: 2, 200238081: 2, 106168914: 2, 112035061: 2, 111829790: 2, 106910362: 2, 200073182: 2, 107847782: 2, 200060911: 2, 110236936: 2, 110935614: 2, 109554938: 2, 200040901: 2, 109083004: 2, 107909507: 2, 107230627: 1, 10232: 1, 106367524: 1, 107301514: 1, 106077459: 1, 108023481: 1, 105952525: 1, 106522843: 1, 106018444: 1, 106536997: 1, 106202961: 1, 106351162: 1, 11884: 1, 106489988: 1, 106967373: 1, 107792163: 1, 107247400: 1, 107567141: 1, 106731930: 1, 106913698: 1, 106909362: 1, 107531373: 1, 107497265: 1, 107323577: 1, 107159816: 1, 107011842: 1, 200065410: 1, 107059069: 1, 110192825: 1, 200173263: 1, 106013776: 1, 108091273: 1, 109447295: 1, 112074286: 1, 111129685: 1, 108271128: 1, 200278380: 1, 105807147: 0, 106167043: 0, 108625148: 0, 108386412: 0, 108747074: 0, 108446880: 0, 108015415: 0, 112858426: 0}"

A bouldery start leads to a good rest near the first bolt, and from there it is pretty much a race against the pump clock.     Sustained climbing separated by a few places to catch a shake lead to a challenging crux towards the top.  Once past the crux, pull over the bulge at the top and climb the slightly heady slab on rounded, slopey holds.  Full value for 40 feet.    In Handren's book this route is rated ""12b?""

This description caused my curiosity to get the better of me so I decided to see what was up with this thing.         As far as difficulty is concerned, I can't really say just how hard this thing is, because it is the hardest thing I have tried this year.

A car was in the ditch, a burro lay in the road, and the head was nowhere to be seen.  We don't know if the passengers were okay...    We decided to name the route after the event and wanted to remind people not to feed the burros.  When they are fed, they come to the road and things like this happen.

This splitter climbs right over the tunneling pitch on Tunnel Vision.  Unfortunately there are some unnecessary bolts below the splitter and before where you reach the belay below the tunneling pitch.  These bolts are new and are placed next to a splitter 1.5"" crack.

Fleeting Boldness,111304885,Trad,105732102,5.10-,580,5,4.0,2.0,"Pitch 1: This is a bit of an approach pitch. Follow gully up to base of the crack system that begins the business pitch of the route. Mostly 4th class, till a large chockstone, tunnel behind this or climb a rail system to the left till one comes to a second chockstone. Climb over the second chockstone or the rock to its right and belay at a bushy ledge. 100 feet, 5.7.       Pitch 2: The business. Off the ledge climb a #2 handcrack and stem to get over a small wedged boulder. Leave the crack and climb around a bush growing in the crack via thin face holds on nice varnish slab. Continue up left leaning #1 handcrack either via jamming or laybacking. Continue up crack as it quickly widens to #5s, and climb twenty feet of perfectly parallel tipped out #6 off width. A #3 big bro would be perfect here. It is possible to layback this. Climb the beautifully smooth varnished squeeze chimney. Without large big bros or valley giants a very large runout is necessary. The easiest way to climb the chimney is right side in and to go all the way back into the chimney. Climb the chimney past some smallish chockstones reaching a ledge large enough for two climbers. 200 feet 5.10        Pitch 3: The elevator shaft pitch. Climb up crack via stemming and face moves to a hole created by a large chockstone reminiscent of Frogland and tunnel through to the ledge created by the mass of blocks. These blocks are more stable than they appear from below. Belay at spacious ledge formed by blocks and enjoy the view. 60 feet 5.9       Pitch 4: Either climb the off width directly above the belay (5.10) or climb the horizontal slab ramp on the right (5.7) further back from the belay. If one chooses the second option a nasty swinging fall is possible but the climbing is easy, the only gear is a decent horizontal #6 in a hueco. Follow the crack / gully system further up on heavily huecoed rock (5.7) through a few bushes. Belay at a long ledge. 160 feet 5.7 or 5.10       Pitch 5: Walk to chimney in the back of the ledge and climb it to the top. No gear. If one went further back into the chimney gear is possible but it may be harder climbing. 60 feet 5.7     ...........       If one squeezes all the way back in the chimney, the optional gear larger than #6 might not be necessary. I led it with nothing larger a BD #6 and wanted bigger gear  but I stayed too far out in the chimney and had my left side in, which made it harder.    My partner and I have some disagreement about the grade. He says 5.10b/c and I say 5.10 - . Climb it and let us know. I think its a pretty good route but Im rather biased. The business pitch is excellent, if a little spicy. The chimney has stellar varnished rock reminiscent of Epinephrine but much tighter. Larry DeAngelo and John Wilder attempted this line a long time ago and bailed perhaps 50 feet into pitch 2. Larry couldnt remember why they bailed, but we found his bail hex  the only sign of previous climbers. Larry encouraged us to give it a go. His encouragement was a big reason we finally did the route. Big thanks Larry!","{106794218: 4, 108177328: 4}"

The pitches above the giant chockstone could have also be unascended,'but we are not sure. The route name pertains to certain dubious anchors built by some persons on other routes that are to remain nameless, but perhaps are included in the FRA description...    Just to the right of Purblind Pillar is the gigantic gaping chimney system which is accessed via the same approach as Fleeting Boldness. (Foolish Woman)  Up some class 4 ramps on good rock to the terrace, then find your way easily to the base of the chimney system.  The 4th Class climbing is beautiful, with fantastic varnished huecos on both walls. Some might want a rope as bulges and some smears would cause a bad fall. Belay as the chimney gets shorter and the angle steepens, just before it turns to the right. 200+- ft    p2 Preparing for an easy squeeze and the unexpected, pop through and go right, leading up a low angle beautiful varnished pocketed face, and then an ever hardening well protected chimney. Belay at a boulder with a thread. Hint: clip rope directly to the thumb loops of big cams here, or the rope will reorient the cams. 5.8- 110 ft    Scramble up into the cathedral-style room, look back outside and the big boulder and corner above your thread and to the right is where the route continues. Inside the mountain behind you is another pitch not part of the route.     P3 after a small bulge, a fun corner with hidden holds brings you to another varnished slab. 5.7 100ft    P4 A slippery looking slab with a corner that widens into a chimney. A short section up to where the chimneys pinches off and you get gear again. A horozontal .75 protects the face moves up to the tree on the pocketed slab. If you clip the fixed hex you've gone too far up the corner. Kind of scary looking climbing above the slab, but short.  After going up the face and slinging the tree, it's all scrambling from here to the top. My least favorite top out of any route on the wall. 200 +- ft 5.8    Back to the hidden pitch....    After pitch two, if you head up into the big room, climb a short 10 ft chimney to another ledge. Up the overhanging OW/chimney (Foolish Man) with no bottom up and with hard squeeze moves up to a talus ramp in a chimney. As the ramp dissipates and the chimney is vertical and with few weaknesses, continue up and eventually towards the outside of the chimney to a big chockstone and thread. A single 60 or 70 will require rapping off a deadman anchor, and double ropes would get you down ok. You can see the actual route outside the top of the chimney, but getting there is kind of impossible without some shenanigans. A strenuous and scary lead.  5.9     If it wasn't for the crappy top out this route would be bad ass. The first 4th class pitch will have you telling your partner how awesome it is, and they will describe that they cannot understand you and to repeat yourself.... The enclosed nature of the route was great. More squeeze chimneys than wide chimneys, and the other pitches are pretty cool as well. Great rock!","{107993865: 3, 108177328: 3, 106794218: 2}"

The tech crux may be the first ten feet starting in a bulging straight up crack that begins fist and wider for a few feet with sandy face holds on either side. At the obvious bulge about 3/4 height, the crack thins from hands down to rings and stacks for a move or two and then fingerlocks just above. At that point you can stem to the wall behind you and use it as the crack pinches off and facey climbing or stemming takes you to the top. There is some mystery fixed tat just before the topout that despite it's appearance, you may be happy to clip.    While the texture isn't bad on this, there is a nasty bit of fin/offset on the bottom on the crack through the middle section that chews on your wrist.

Group Therapy,105732473,Trad,105732102,5.7,755,6,2.9,279.0,"Approach as for Tunnel Vision. From the base of TV, work right about 100' to an alcove with a pine tree.  P1: (140', 5.5) Climb up a ways toward the massive cleft above (Healy's Haunted House) but then swing left onto a well featured face. Climb up through an easy bulge and belay on ledges at the base of a prominant off-width that splits the yellow face above. This crack is easily seen from the ground as you approach.  P2: (140', 5.6) The crack soon turns into an offwidth in relatively low angled rock. The moves are pretty easy if you use wide crack technique (heel-toe time!) but this section is fairly sustained. Thin flakes in the side of the crack offer somewhat insecure pro. A #5 Camalot could probably walk up this whole section. Belay at a ledge where the crack thins down again.  P3: (110', 5.5) Climb up the crack and work left before it ends, moving to an obvious crack system coming down from the large roof above. Belay in ledges.  P4: (110', 5.5) Continue up to an area of bushes in the crack. About 20' of easy simulclimbing combines this with the previous pitch.  P5: (180', 5.7) Work up the widening crack to the roof using the slab on the left side. The roof looks improbable but by working in (for pro) and out (for good holds) you can surmount the roof without too much effort. Continue up the crack / chimney into a big alcove and belay.  P6: (150', 5.4) Climb up another 30' or so then avoid the wide crack above (a 5.8 finish) by traversing left on a ledge system to easier ground and the top.  P5 is classic Vegas climbing: an improbable line through a big overhang that looks far harder than it is. You'll need a few big cams (or hexes) to feel comfy on this pitch. We didn't have much big stuff (#2, #3, #3.5 camalot) but the pro seemed adaquate. Just use little stuff whenever possible. The easy part of the chimney below the belay was runout but not scary.  This route was a lot more fun than Tunnel Vision. Plus less waiting in line.

(P1) Climb the chimney until reaching a ledge at about 135'.There will probably be rap slings at this point(5.7+). Belay here and wonder why there are rap slings.    (P2) The next lead is more than just interesting. I was able to place two marginal pieces of pro here to protect myself stemming the chimney to the jam above; one pulled; I doubt the other would have held a fall. A fall here would result in a bounce off the ledge then a plunge into the dark pit below 30'(5.9). On the ledge above the jam, there will again be rap slings. By this time, some parties will be late; some will be freaked out; and some will have lost all faith in the guide .    (P3 through P5) continue up the chimney/crack system to the top max 5.7.     Descent: go southwest to the gully and down. There will be one rap. The problems with this route are known to the climbing rangers at RR.

Killin' Time,106304713,Trad,105732102,5.7,70,1,2.0,2.0,"Not so much a route on Angel Food Wall but rather, a short crack on a good face on the small buttress that splits the Angel Food Descent Gully about half way down the gully.  If you've just completed a climb of Tunnel Vision, Purblind Pillar or any of the other fine lines on the Angel Food Wall but need to kill some time on the descent while waiting for your slower friends (like we were recently) this is a fun little line to climb as you walk right past it while descending from the wall.     This is the mostly-fingers crack that splits the east face of the major buttress in the middle of the descent gully about 1/2 way down. As you descend down the gully, look back up at the east face of the buttress. Start climbing near some small bushes and find good .4 to .75 camalot placements to protect the initial bulge/roof. Up higher a tricky move past a tiny roof on less than perfect rock leads to better rock and good patina face holds along the crack to the left side of a bigger roof. Find a nice .5 camalot placement in the corner back under the roof to protect the moves left around it and enjoy fun face climbing to the flat top of the buttress.","{200398692: 2, 14595: 1}"

Purblind Pillar,105821892,Trad,105732102,5.8,900,6,3.1,297.0,"""Purblind"" starts at the obvious crack system about 80 feet west and slightly up from the beginning of ""Healy's Haunted House"".  Approach as for both ""Group Therapy"" and ""Healy's"".      Pitch 1 (5.7): Begin climbing the easy crack/corner system for about 20 feet to a ledge with trees and shrubs.  Pass the vegetation on the right and continue up the stellar crack system until you reach the end of the crack at a sling belay (190 ft.)    Pitch 2 (5.8)  From the sling belay head up and right along a crack/flake line below an overhang.  When the crack diminishes, move right on white, slabby face to a bolt.  From the bolt move out right on rounded holds to cross over a shoulder to easier ground.  Scamper directly up for a few feet to a flat ledge below another crack system and the belay--takes 1-1.75 cams (85 ft.)      Pitch 3 (5.7)  From the pitch 2 belay move directly right about 20 feet along a ledge to a water groove/crack system.  Do not climb the crack/chimney system directly above the pitch two belay unless you plan on doing the 5.9 variation*.  After traversing out right you will encounter a water groove/crack system.  Climb this for another 30 feet or so and then traverse directly right onto the obvious brown face (a bolt protects the move out of the groove).  Continue to traverse straight right--after clipping the bolt--on excellent holds until you reach the water groove/crack system that borders the right side of the brown face.  Climb up this for a short distance and then traverse up and right a bit to a spacious ledge area below an obvious vertical crack system (150 ft.)    Pitch 4 (5.7)  From the spacious ledge climb the obvious crack system to its end.  The crack is very wide in places, but adequate protection can be had.  When the crack ends, trend along a ledge system overlooking a large, brushy chasm/gully on your left.  At the end of the ledge you will find a bolted belay anchor in white rock.  This ledge is very comfortable for up to 4 people (180 ft.)    Pitch 5 (5.8): From the bolted belay head up the micro-crack system on white rock (a single bolt protects the moves off of the belay).  Continue up the crack system and then traverse directly right up easy ground to another excellent ledge area below an impressive left-facing dihedral (120 ft.)    Pitch 6 (5.7-):  From the large ledge head up to the base of the large dihedral.  From the belay you will see a large patch of shrubbery blocking the entrance to a menacing off-width.  Head towards the bush, but when feasible veer left to the face just left of the off-width.  You will see a bolt at the base of the face, clip this and climb up over excellent 5.6 terrain to another bolt, from here traverse right into the crack (the bush remains inviolate!) and head up to a class four ramp that ends at the top (195 ft.).     5.9 variation: instead of traversing right from the pitch 2 belay, go straight up the crack system directly above the pitch 2 belay.  This pitch ends at a bolted belay anchor (80 ft.).  From the anchor traverse right on easy holds to a water groove.  Climb the groove up until just below a patch of diabolical scrub-oak (50 feet).  Belay in the groove using a couple of large cams in pockets in the base of the groove itself.  The next pitch ascends the obvious broad corner to the right of the water groove/now gully, with the small crack in its right side.  A bolt protects the initial moves into the crack.  Although this 5.9 pitch is good, initially it is somewhat friable, and not easy to protect.  A Wild country Z3 cam (gray) protects the move above the bolt.  After a few moves the crack widens to accept .33 to .5 cams.  This is a technical pitch.  Upon reaching the top of the corner and the end of the crack, traverse right around an improbable shoulder (strange mud-colored rock) and then up easy ground to end at the normal route pitch 4 bolted belay.

Pitch 1 - Start in the corner system 30' left of Tunnel Vision. Climb past the bulge and wander up and to the right on big holds. Pass old bail webbing and climb into the huge chimney. There is more old rappel webbing here; ignore that and build a gear anchor. (200')    Pitch 2 - The deep dark chimney. You will know you are on route and heading in the right direction once you hit the ""Sandy Hole /Ledge"". Head straight up from here; once level with the glowing light, make an easy traverse over and out passing a rusty bolt with a homemade hanger. Build a gear anchor near the exit of the chimney. Be mindful of rope drag. (120')    Pitch 3 - From here I climbed up and right clipping a bolt, eventually linking up with the ""Tunnel Pitch"" of Tunnel Vision.

At the top of the chimney, where the crack narrows, exit to the left (which is easier than it looks) and belay.

P1) 5.6 Climb the right facing corner for 15', then hand traverse at the roof right for a few feet until the main crack system is reached.  Follow this crack system up, then through a chimney to the first belay.  Make sure to watch out for rope drag around the opening corner.    P2) 5.4 Chimney up the wide easy chimney, belaying at a fixed anchor.    P3) 5.7 Another chimney pitch. This pitch is hard to protect, and is steeper and more narrow than the previous chimney.  Stops at a huge ledge.    P4) 5.5 Continue up most of a rope length to another huge ledge.    P5) 5.3 Climb left into the vertical tunnel.  This is a very interesting and unique pitch.  However, the rock is quite slick, and pro is scarce until climbing out the other side of the tunnel.  Finish with a short crack to another big ledge.

Belay from a sloping ledge that is held together by a few large scrub oaks.    P2 (90', 5.10+): Move up the wide crack which is relatively easy at first and leads to a strenuous stance on an obvious foothold. From this foothold, the crack overhangs wildly and the next 15' are very difficult. Thrutch upwards to a salvation hand jam and mantle onto a flake for a rest. From here a relatively easy squeeze chimney leads up and into the ""hole"". I recommend moving just above the hole to a great stance for a belay off of medium wires. A memorable pitch.    P3 (60', 5.9): Climb up and left on a ramp. Perhaps the most logical option would be to move around the corner at this point to a large platform shared with the second pitch of The Ledger and descend that route, but the original line moved back right onto the face (one unprotected 5.9 move) to easier climbing up thin patches of varnish to the top of the wall.

Turn the corner of the arete and find another bolt. From here there are 2 option's. Option 1; continue across the obvious varnished face, on very poor(breakable) holds until you reach a bolt(5.11+). Option 2; head straight up the arete until you reach an obvious horizontal hand traverse then climb right to the aforementioned bolt(5.10).

On the north east side of this ledge I slung webbing around a large chunk of rock. One single rope rappel gets you back to the top of P1, 90' Rope stretch keeps you from popping off the ends.

Northeast Arete,105732404,Trad,105732072,5.5,800,5,3.3,32.0,"Here is a route with an approach that will take you longer than doing the route itself!  If this turns you off, no need to read farther.  This route looks intriguing from the loop road, but it is a huge effort to get to the base and the route is shorter than it looks (only 5 pitches).  It is best to take a very small rack as the climb is not that hard.  This route is the Snake Dike of Red Rocks, but that perhaps is too big a compliment.  Still, I highly recommend this route if you are up for an adventurous day of mostly hiking.    Approaches (from hardest to easiest): (1) Climb the Frigid Air Buttress, then wander up through the maze in front of the summit to the base of the climb.  In my photo this approach goes directly towards the summit dome from below.  Be warned that the easiest routes on the Frigid Air Buttress are considerably harder than 5.6, and could be up to 9 pitches long!  I don't know anyone who has done it this way, although I'm sure some parties have done it.    (2) Hike up the broad ridge south (left) of the entrance to Refrigerator Canyon.  This is the way we went, marked by the black line in the photo.  Most of this route appears to be easy, and indeed almost all of it is scrambling.  At one point there is a 200' high cliff (visible in the sun on the ridge before cutting back right), we couldn't find any way to scramble around it.  So we did 2 pitches up grungy rock with some 5.8 to climb the wall directly.  6 hours to the base of the route!  We marveled at the climbing ability of some bighorn sheep on this approach.    (3) Take the trail up Bridge Mountain (requiring a long hike from Willow Springs or 4WD to get to the trailhead).  Before reaching the summit, you will see the arch the peak is named after and beyond that the ""hidden forest"" in a pocket of soil in the slickrock.  Head NE down a slot and traverse east to the base of the route, I believe this approach is the red line I have marked in the photo although I have not done it.  See Swain's guide for more info.    The climb itself follows cracks on a blunt arete and goes quickly.  The setting feels surprisingly remote.    Descent: I suppose one could go back down using the descent on approach (3) and then down the east side using (1) or (2), but this sounds like an epic.  The usual descent is to go down the trail.  Beware that this route follows bare rock at the start and is not that easy to locate.  You can try hitchhiking back from the trailhead but no SUV's passed us and we ended up walking along the road all the way back to our car at Willow Springs, a distance of 8-10 miles from the summit.

Buffalo Soldiers,118633992,Trad,105732177,5.12c,750,6,4.0,1.0,"This excellent climb tackles the right side of the Buffalo Wall in six challenging pitches. Along with the Rainbow Wall and the Black Velvet Wall, the Buffalo Wall is the third great wall in Red Rocks, and although it is the smallest of the three, it is easily the most committing and intimidating. Likewise, Buffalo Soldiers, though ""only"" 5.12, is a route with both difficult climbing and a few serious sections. The FFA was done with top-down rehearsal, but I believe attempting the route ground-up is not an insane proposition if you are experienced and confident.The climbing is great and the location is stunning, but there's plenty of soft rock, fragile holds, and some loose blocks up there: Don't check your technique at the door and crank your way up this thing lest you destroy the climb or hurt someone. On that note, a helmet might be a good idea. Climb gets morning sun and afternoon shade, a good cold-weather outing.Begin on the right side of the wall on a nice, level, polished ledge system below a short left-facing corner with a thin crack.P1 (5.12a, 150'): Lieback up a short left-facing corner, then face climb more easily out left and then back right again. The beautiful varnished corner above is the crux: Typical Red Rocks trickery. You can stare it down as long as you want before you give ‘er. Belay at a good stance.P2 (5.12b, 120'): Continue up the beautiful corner: A hard move off the belay leads to some easier climbing and then another typical, tricky Red Rocks crux. Above, at a fixed hex, move left across a face and work towards another varnished corner, this time right-facing. Good route finding is essential here: The original aid line climbed this corner following a string of old 1/4"" bolts and rivets. Do not go this way! Instead, before reaching the corner, work back right around a roof and launch upwards via an intimidating runout on perfect varnish. Eventually you will move left again and back onto the aid line which leads to a small but comfortable belay ledge.P3 (5.11a, 150'): Move left from the belay, then up via some thin cracks to a gaping offwidth. Follow this for 100' then move back right to a great belay ledge. Without large cams this pitch has some run outs on easier ground.P4 (5.12c, 140'): Begin by stepping right off the belay and tip-toe up some fragile rock to a large ledge. From the ledge climb up into a left-facing corner and through a wide section passing a toaster-size chockstone. Be very careful with this - it is slung for pro and provides for a good rest but it may not be able to stand up to repeated abuse. Continue upwards with commitment to a devious stemming boulder problem (about V4) on fragile holds to a marginal rest under a roof. Immediately enter another, extended boulder problem (V5?) pulling the roof onto an initially desperate but gradually easing slab. Finish by crawling rightwards to a belay on a long, narrow ledge. The crux section of this pitch is complex, technically demanding and brilliant.P5 (5.12b, 100'): Move the belay to the right end of the ledge and climb past a fragile white flake to gain a left-facing, left-leaning corner. This strenuous Indian Creek-style pitch gets harder as it thins until you can make an heroic reach to a jug. Cop a rest and continue more easily up featured rock to another great belay ledge. The original route ended here: It is possible to scramble off to the right if necessary.P6 (5.11b, 80'): This new addition to the route ascends the exposed headwall directly above the belay - highly recommended! Aiming for twin black streaks, face climb up a slightly overhanging wall that seems straight out of the Sandstone Quarry and culminates in a dramatic top out to one of the nicest ""summits"" in all of Red Rocks.Rap the route with 2x ropes or walk down to Rocky Gap Road.",{10168: 4}

Descent: look for a big chockstone back and to the left from the top.  Either rap 50' or downclimb the chimney beneath the chock to easier ground - the downclimb is a lot easier than it looks from above.  Proceed along the ridge avoiding the temptation to drop off right to the upper part of the canyon - this is well cairned.  If you roughly follow the edge of the buttress you'll find a pine tree with rap slings about 60' before the ridge hits the slot where the stream runs.  Rap about 50' to a big ledge with an anchor.  From here, a 190' rap takes you to a new bolted rap station.  There is a ledge partway down this but we didn't see an anchor on it (but we didn't look too hard).  From the bolts it's about 100' to a big ledge.  There was an anchor on the left side of the ledge that takes you 100' to the streambed.    We took about 6 hours to do the route and 2 hours to descend.  We were in the sun till around 10am.      While this route lacks the elegant line of something like Crimson or Dark Shadows, it has a lot of fun pitches separated by big ledges.  It appears to get very little traffic even though it's very close to the road.  Check it out!

Tookish Instincts,116634342,Trad,105732099,5.9,700,8,2.0,2.0,"This was an accidental diversion from Middle Earth that turned out to have some decent climbing. I wouldn't be surprised if somebody has stumbled upon this before. We can recommend it as a variation if you've already done Middle Earth and want to mix it up on the second go.  The story is that on our first trip up Middle Earth, we missed the namesake tunnel and accidentally climbed the corner to the right. We couldn't get back into the chimney so we improvised our way to the top of the buttress. The next day we met with Larry to give him the story and show him some photos of where we went. His told us we should've trusted our Wimpstincts. By that he meant we were supposed to instinctively burrow into the secure tunnel instead of venturing up the scary-looking crack to the right. Oops. We had a good laugh about it. Our mistake carried a silver lining in that we stumbled into a very good wide crack pitch (Pitch 6) that is worth doing in itself. The rest of the climbing is mediocre at best. The route description follows:  Pitches 1-4 (320 feet): As for Middle Earth. First pitch 5.9 offwidth; second pitch 5.8 left-leaning handcrack; third pitch move the belay; fourth pitch 5.7 dihedral and traverse back left into main chimney system. Linking P2+3 is recommended.  Pitch 5 (5.8, 100 feet): Instead of burrowing into the tunnel, climb the exfoliating left-facing corner just to the right. The rock quality is a bit suspect at times (we did not clean it at all) but I'd say overall it climbs better than it looks. Above the corner, climb straight up the knobby face (5.5 R) up to a ledge guarded by thick bushes.  Wrestle past the bushes to the base of a hidden, straight-in offwidth crack.  Pitch 6 (5.7, 110 feet): Climb the super-fun featured offwidth. Bump that trusty 6"" cam as you cruise up the amazing jugs and flakes. Follow the crack as it widens to a chimney and slants to the right. This pitch ends at a wide ledge shared with Frigid Air Buttress (below that route's 8th-pitch headwall).  At this point, you can finish on the Frigid Air Buttress headwall pitch if desired. Tookish Instincts continues left:  Pitch 7 (4th class, 60 feet): Scramble up and left to the top of the pillar. Walk 40 feet left to the opposite end of the ledge and set a belay in the floor crack.  Pitch 8 (5.8, 110 feet): Step down and left off the pillar, traversing 10 feet left on crimp rails into a hand-fist crack. This traverse is fine for the leader but pretty dicey for the follower unless the leader resists placing gear until higher up the crack. The rock quality deteriorates and after a tricky bulge it becomes an easy scramble to the top of the buttress.  Descent: As for the original Frigid Air Buttress route.","{111575643: 2, 112536696: 2}"

Pitch 1: Start up the left facing corner system, there are a couple of ways to do this. Continue up the obvious crack and corner system aiming for the first big bush covered ledge and belay. 215ft, 5.10.    Pitch 2: Climb off the left side of the ledge up towards a slightly lower angle bushy area. Avoid most of the bushes by climbing on the right. Step back left through the biggest bush. The crack above the biggest bush is filled with loose blocks, these can be avoided by traversing out left on a ledgy area then back right into the corner(its obvious). Once back in the corner climb up until a ledge/foot rail/ramp thing appears on the right. Follow this out and around the corner to a ledge. Belay here if the rope drag in bad, or continue up another 40 ft(or so) to the huge bushy ledge. 150-190 ft, 5.10.    Pitch 3: Either move the belay to the other side of the ledge or climb the forty feet up from the previous ledge. On the ledge,stop under the only crack that doesn't pinch down into nothing, its 3/4 of the way across the big ledge. 150ft, 5.8.    Pitch 4: Climb the aforementioned crack. Get gear where you can. about half way up you'll encounter a slab section. The left side (where a crack should be) is full of vegation, so step over right and gain the corner. Once in the corner, there is a key #3 Camalot placement, have one when you get there. Do full foot to foot stemming up the wide channel, starfish! This wide channel is capped by a roof, pass it on the right. Yard up one last section of vegated and flared crack and belay on the nice, big, flat ledge. 130 ft, 5.10+    Pitch 5: Start by traversing out left on the ledge, balancy and exposed. Climb the corner/flake system above to a sloping ledge. Climb off the right side, over a bulge,to the face above. Climb past a tree and up the corner and slab above. Pass the first crux just after the tree. You're now climbing on the black water streak in the center of the wall. Get to a nice little ledge/stance, place some gear and contemplate the crux above. Figure your way through the bulge and small holds. There is a key thread (currently fixed) just above the crux. Climb up into another steep section. Here it gets tricky. Either continue up the weird,hard,steepness above or tension traverse off the now fixed #2 cam down and right into the obvious chimney/ flare. Climb the chimney/ flare up to a big bushy ledge. If you continue straight up find a belay up there somewhere!   150ft, 5.11, AO. or 5.11?    Pitch 6: We soloed off from here by heading up and right, then back left, then right again.

The Crack is the most recognizable feature - it is S-shaped - and it's on a large free-standing pillar of mostly brown varnished rock. Sight the pillar from the Icebox parking lot, head up the trail a ways until you can cut south through the wash and bushwhack up the slope to the base of the climb.    The route starts as an off-width chimney which is not very well protected. Proceed up the crack to a large ledge at the base of a dihedral on the right side of the pillar. Shoot up the left face to the top of the feature. You can climb the route in a single 200 foot pitch or belay at the ledge which would help alleviate rope drag.     Walk off down the gully on the left (east) side of the pillar back to the base of the climb. There is an optional short rappel at the start of this descent.    The Red Book describes this as ""a popular crack climb,"" yet I had the feeling that it hadn't been climbed in years.

Move rappellers right into the gully and still further into the chimney on the right side of the gully, continue down until you find firm ground in a tight slot. Careful pulling those ropes!    Now it gets fun!    Move down the easy ground in the gully until you reach a thread through with 6mm cord and a rap ring.  Rappel through chimney to terra firma!

This gully is on the left (east) side of the Wall. Approach as for Necromancer Wall then walk left until you are at the base of the descent gully. Scramble up ledges about 100 feet until you reach the base of the climb.    Pitch 1: Climb the dihedral through many off-width sections. At the top of the corner, go through the vegetation and loose blocks and belay under the roof that caps the left chimney.    Pitch 2: Stem the chimney, undercling the splitter crack on the left side of the ceiling and pull the well-protected crux move that surpasses the roof on the left side and then fire up the chimney to the top. This chimney is a tight squeeze.     Descent: From the top of the feature, scramble down to the climbers right (west) toward Necromancer Wall. Descend the gully that is between Atras and Necromancer Wall. There are a few slings in the gully for rappelling, but I've always downclimbed it.    Notes: This route is definitely a stiff 5.8 but a very fun climb featuring a wide variation of techniques. There is an easier escape chimney on the right side above pitch 1, probably 5.7.     Also, at the top of pitch 1 I actually set up a belay in the crack below the escape chimney and then did a short, poorly protected traverse left to the crux chimney at the start of pitch 2. This may be a good idea as the crux chimney had a lot of loose flakes that I was raining down on the standard belay position.","{11591: 4, 14098: 4, 14537: 4, 106684182: 4, 109334029: 3, 11048: 3, 109726056: 3, 111757042: 3, 108052600: 3, 107646590: 3, 14597: 3, 105805486: 3, 109638995: 3, 106291728: 3, 106310836: 3, 10900: 3, 10380: 3, 107325508: 2, 200177277: 2, 107663850: 2, 108177328: 2, 106069168: 2, 109285734: 1, 106434221: 1}"

Scramble out of the wash to a prominent blonde pedestal of soft rock piled against the Refrigerator Wall.  You'll see the bolts of Kisses Don't Lie around to the left of Breakaway while hiking in the wash.    The first pitch leaves the top of the pedestal past four bolts on some brown varnish.  Every hard (5.8) move has a bolt where you need it.  Near the top of the first pitch it slabs out.  Set up a gear belay (#1, 1.25, and 3 friend) in some cracks near the top of the slab.  You'll belay off some footholds, but still on the slab.    From the first belay, move up and left toward the first bolt and the beggining of the black streak.  A blue alien and #2 wallnut protect some 10a moves up to the first bolt.  Charge through the first two bolts on steep rock (crux, 10c).  The wall above looks to be about 11d.  You'll be thinking about those RP's you left at the base, but not to worry.  The holds next to the thin seam are always good, the bolts (a total of eleven on this pitch) are close enough, and the position is fantastic.

Nevertheless, when I first led this route one year ago I was addicted and made the decision then to replace the old star drives and rusted Leeper hangers placed in 1979 with new 1/2 inch expansion bolts (Two newer 3/8inch bolts remain part of the route).  Out of respect for the first ascensionists no additional bolts were added, but the anchor is moved higher up the route to what would seem a more logical stance at 95 feet (which also allows a midway anchor for a single 60m rope rap of Kisses Don't Lie).  It does appear that sometime between 1979 and present a bolt was added at the bottom of the route. The guidebook clocks this at 10d!, but the second pitch traverse left to finish on KDL is easily 11c and is an impressive onsite.    To the beta!  Climb up the ramp right of Kisses Don't Lie.      P1 (95', 5.10d R) The crux of the first pitch is the smooth friction climbing past the first two bolts. Some might consider clipping the first bolt given the precarious start. Continue up a series of easier crimps with widely spaced bolts to a small crack then move up and left in shallow corner to the new camouflaged chain anchors (5 bolts).    P2 (45', 5.11c PG13) The second pitch is heady with runout but the crux is protected by a new bolt on the traverse.  There is gear before the bolt at the crux.  From the anchor traverse out right around the rib then make easier moves working up and back left of the rib into the corner (5.8).  After clipping the bolt down climb and then traverse left using the short crack and some very tenuous footwork in small dishes (crux).  After a sigh of relief finish on the last 15 feet (5.9) of Kisses Don't Lie to the anchor.      The pitches can be combined into one awesome 140' pitch (bring a long sling) but isn't as awesome as its neighbor to the left.

This style of climbing will perhaps never be popular, but for those who are into it, or want to challenge themselves, this is a beauty.    P1 (140', 5.12a/b PG13): Climb up the slab passing four bolts with black hangers. The wall steepens and the route follows a vague rib feature of barely usable holds. There is a 15' stretch of climbing where you're just barely on - it feels hard as nails until you let go of your gravitational inhibitions and transcend. Then a rest and then higher another crux (11+) and a run to the anchor, but the whole pitch has multiple 5.10+/5.11- slab sections. 11 bolts which, despite their reputation, I believe are very well-placed for the lead (though the crux bolt is indeed difficult to clip without the draw in place).    P2 (110', 5.11b PG13): Step right from the belay and pull over a roof. Climb an exposed corner passing bolts and gear placements to a great stance on a hollow pillar. Ignore a bolt way up and left, and instead load up the face with gear, step down and move right with commitment. Continue upwards via laser-cut edges and then into a welcomed stemming section up two opposing flakes. Above these, pull the intimidating roof (key #2 Camalot) that caps the pitch and guards the chains.

Continue up a series of left-facing flakes (lots of hollow rock here - tread lightly) before pulling over a small roof to a stance, then up to the steep headwall above. Finally, step left (crux) following a thin crack and edges to a belay at a good stance.

Clip this repurposed bolt with a long sling and head straight up a seam in nice rock to a roof. Pull the roof and climb a final face to a fixed ‘biner anchor.  Descend by rapping the route.

You will pass several small caves and roofs before reaching varnished rock. Keep going - Spring Break lies slightly west of the Magellanic Cloud/Cold September Corner area on a rectangular face of dark rock immediately left of a huge right facing corner capped by chossy roofs. There is a ledge atop this face with a communal anchor at a large horizintal break where the rock becomes less neat and more cruddy.  Spring Break ascends the center of the rectangular face following a thin crack system and horizontals.  P1, .11+: A little grunt off of the deck will get you to an inviting horizontal crack/jug where you can assess exactly how far you might fall in the very near future. Proceed, following the thin vertical crack through the first roof, cramming gear wherever possible. More gear, more climbing lead you to a second roof, after which is a very much appreciated horizontal, rest and relaxation included. More climbing, more gear (trend to the right, back toward the middle of the face and straight up at the last thin crack), deep breath, clip anchors, rap with a rope, sit in the sun, have a snack or a drink of water. A nap is also acceptable.  This can easily be TR'd by leading Mister Masters (9+) around the corner to the east.

The crux might be short, but it's a showstopper. This fact combined with wide gear, en-route moss/bushwhacking, and ""surprise splitters"" give the route a unique character. It calls out to the Red Rocks climber wanting to get off the beaten path for some old-timey fun.  The route gets no sunlight - at least not in the winter. I doubt it would see much sun in summer.  Pitch 1 (5.10d PG-13, 160 feet): Screw your head on and climb the dark spooky corner up varied cracks to a ledge belay 30 feet below the Woods. The first 50 feet are mossy and gross but the rock gradually gets cleaner as you go. The crux is transitioning between thin corners about two-thirds of the way up. If you can get up this pitch, you will have no problem getting to the top.  Pitch 2 (5.7 R, 60 feet): Starting in an offwidth flare on the far right side, gradually trend up and left across the face (sparse pro - trust your instincts) to arrive at a cramped belay on the left side of the Woods, beneath an obvious wide crack.  Pitch 3 (5.9, 80 feet): Fun pitch. Climb the heinous offwidth into a sunken dihedral with several cracks at your disposal. You can see clear through one of the handcracks to blue sky on the other side of the enormous pillar. Belay on a good ledge on the right as rock quality deteriorates.  Pitch 4 (5.9, 90 feet): The money pitch. First you have to deal with a tricky bulge on junky rock, but then you get to jam an awesome varnished splitter up to the Deluxe Vista Ledge.  Pitch 5 (5.8, 100 feet): Walk to the middle of the Deluxe Vista Ledge where a single crack slices straight up the dappled headwall. Follow the crack past a trio of small roofs (be cautious with the oversized patina buckets) to a sweet belay nook.  Unrope and scramble (3rd class) ~300 vertical feet up to the top of the wall, which is the northeast spur of Bridge Mountain. From this ""summit"" you have splendid views out toward the expanse of Las Vegas and also back into the depths of Icebox Canyon.  Descent: Simply head straight down the gigantic slope to the road.

Approach as to ""The Brass Wall."" This route is on ""Brass Wall Left.""  The first pitch is also the start of a climb called ""The Big Horn.""  Starts on a ledge with a single scrub oak.    Pitch 1: Climb the obvious crack which shoots up to the big ledge. Continue up the well-protected varnished crack/face with lots of features for hands and feet. This pitch loves nuts! Climb straight up to the big ledge with a scrub oak. Bolted anchors. 5.6.    Pitch 2: Stay right of the chimney (the chimney to the left of the anchors is the start of pitch 2 of The Big Horn.) Start on the face above the anchors. Climb up to a left-facing corner. There are a couple of little offwidth moves in this section. Stay right at the top of the chimney, stepping out of the alcove, then move left into the crack, climbing up to a ledge with loose rock and a bolted anchor. 5.7.    Pitch 3: Climb up about 10 feet and look to your left, for a left-leaning, right-facing corner/ramp. Follow the fun, narrow ramp, continuing to traverse left, to a protection bolt. The pro a little tricky before the bolt: nuts in not too obvious seams. Move a little left of the bolt, then go straight up to the thin right-facing corner and up right to a ledge with bolted anchors. 5.7+.    Pitch 4: Climb up and traverse right about 20-30 feet heading for black varnished face holds. Climb up the black varnished face, following the path of least resistance, to a belay at a small stance.  The P4 belay can not be seen until about 15 feet from it. A good amount of gear can be had on this pitch. 5.6.    Note: Don't go straight up from the belay; the climbing peters out into unprotectable face climbing on less than inspiring white/orange rock.    Pitch 5: From the belay look up and right 60 feet or more for a light brown 2-3 ft roof (about 20-30 feet to the right of the belay). Birdland goes just left of the edge of that roof and up the nice crack that is above the roof and out of sight. This pitch ends with a beautiful finger crack to a triangular stepping stool to reach the anchors. The last moves to the belay are the crux. Fight for this pitch! 5.7+.

A 5'10"" climber with ape-like arms (me) or a 6'0"" man will find the grade about right. It will be a little easier for the very tall and could be much harder for the very short.

It is possible after the second bolt to escape from the face around the corner to the right to make the climbing much easier and better protected but I chose to stay out on the face as the climbing is more sustained and better quality there.  I placed 11 pieces of protection including the bolts in 150 feet of climbing.

Ascend three pitches of 5.7 up the corner (good protection,good belay stances-- a couple of short bulges make the first two pitches fun).  It is likely that these first two pitches were climbed in the 1980s.  The third pitch is short and ascends a weird chimney to exit behind a chockstone (tight) and unto a ledge system that extends right unto the Birdland face.  After exiting the chockstone squeeze,leave the corner system and traverse about 10 feet right on the ledge system to belay.           Pitch 4 (175') ascends the main Birdland face to the right of the corner system.  Climb to a protection bolt on a small white face about 30 feet above the pitch 3 belay.  From the bolt go up to a diagonal ledge/crack system (good #3-4 Friend placements).  Follow this ledge/crack up and a bit right 20 feet to just below and left of an overhanging black flake with white calcium deposits beneath it.  There you will find a series of solution pockets/holes going straight up (steep), the pockets take medium to large size cams (#3,#4 Friends).  When the solution pockets/holes end, bear right and upwards (another protection bolt) to the bolted station just below a small triangular shaped arch.           Pitch 5 (90') ascends straight up from the pitch 4 hanging belay.  A slider nut or very small cam is useful to protect the first 10 feet off of the anchors (perfect horizontal micro crack).  Follow various cracks straight up over the small triangular arch (well protected with stoppers in a horizontal crack at the base of the arch) to a small ledge.  Avoid climbing over the arch at its apex as there is a loose block that must be avoided.  From here ascend a white face with a small crack system on the left until you reach a good ledge with a bolted station.  This pitch is well protected with medium stoppers.

From the fixed anchor up top, Rap 70' to the ground on a single rope.","{106893421: 4, 10515: 4, 12448: 4, 10185: 4, 105789759: 4, 105798239: 4, 105834012: 4, 105988971: 4, 13937: 4, 107663850: 4, 105789549: 4, 12023: 4, 107819356: 4, 14595: 4, 106339217: 4, 105832409: 4, 106446644: 4, 14213: 4, 105956617: 4, 105932818: 4, 106755817: 4, 106449553: 4, 106794348: 4, 106874543: 4, 106744745: 4, 107326021: 4, 105944772: 4, 106182300: 4, 107301514: 4, 106384459: 4, 107405626: 4, 108252958: 4, 107897244: 4, 107300420: 4, 107469550: 4, 107067454: 4, 109107529: 4, 109664886: 4, 107992032: 4, 107080237: 4, 107623020: 4, 106945549: 4, 109554938: 4, 112212034: 4, 109727162: 4, 107591659: 4, 106983776: 4, 108852723: 4, 200064982: 4, 109104070: 4, 111284682: 4, 200172735: 4, 112432698: 4, 200235434: 4, 200109015: 4, 111895157: 4, 108746269: 4, 107819587: 4, 106486112: 3, 106740382: 3, 105787348: 3, 14098: 3, 105787222: 3, 11591: 3, 12486: 3, 13965: 3, 10762: 3, 105808624: 3, 105895326: 3, 10481: 3, 105905828: 3, 10996: 3, 105916916: 3, 13318: 3, 105872388: 3, 10445: 3, 105913057: 3, 105805486: 3, 105946742: 3, 105817062: 3, 106685212: 3, 105887189: 3, 15023: 3, 105826344: 3, 105805388: 3, 106160164: 3, 106351162: 3, 106697740: 3, 106596992: 3, 107374312: 3, 107137428: 3, 106268558: 3, 106690825: 3, 105970716: 3, 107554754: 3, 105807147: 3, 105904878: 3, 106372764: 3, 105834509: 3, 105791779: 3, 106210225: 3, 106522843: 3, 106411080: 3, 105851629: 3, 106119518: 3, 106561130: 3, 106525848: 3, 105832216: 3, 106435914: 3, 12237: 3, 106314797: 3, 105967115: 3, 105941791: 3, 105990845: 3, 105829653: 3, 106310836: 3, 105927097: 3, 106988369: 3, 106958423: 3, 105854232: 3, 106077459: 3, 106158624: 3, 106095805: 3, 106253603: 3, 106257523: 3, 105794043: 3, 107561676: 3, 106670517: 3, 12988: 3, 107989551: 3, 106974860: 3, 105975214: 3, 107254662: 3, 108150909: 3, 106601971: 3, 107390686: 3, 108773072: 3, 108142594: 3, 105833503: 3, 109334029: 3, 108967941: 3, 105820266: 3, 106794218: 3, 107889629: 3, 109117485: 3, 105936209: 3, 106886459: 3, 109883558: 3, 108358112: 3, 107650191: 3, 108793472: 3, 109050706: 3, 106945872: 3, 108070865: 3, 10170: 3, 106123628: 3, 107821712: 3, 106129363: 3, 109663521: 3, 106569438: 3, 107929356: 3, 110944667: 3, 110062569: 3, 108121087: 3, 107436418: 3, 106058175: 3, 105873502: 3, 109620395: 3, 108195060: 3, 106095990: 3, 108901800: 3, 111971885: 3, 105846944: 3, 107435323: 3, 111757042: 3, 110652445: 3, 111936426: 3, 109018466: 3, 107962119: 3, 106434221: 3, 110536605: 3, 112418846: 3, 108996063: 3, 7056718: 3, 108259749: 3, 109392224: 3, 108271128: 3, 111769420: 3, 107510204: 3, 111903631: 3, 107185927: 3, 200083957: 3, 108032974: 3, 112495943: 3, 200078679: 3, 200380908: 3, 12258: 3, 109260781: 3, 111417601: 3, 107390765: 3, 110619029: 3, 112073820: 3, 111278312: 3, 108170319: 3, 107559644: 3, 14977: 3, 109755410: 3, 111252595: 3, 108272772: 3, 111998109: 3, 110331339: 3, 108149490: 3, 107608314: 3, 108254193: 3, 111014490: 3, 200461130: 3, 200188108: 3, 200505425: 3, 110288256: 3, 200493116: 3, 107102882: 3, 107467696: 3, 107522382: 3, 200213605: 3, 110427239: 3, 200070559: 3, 111829790: 3, 110592577: 3, 107175792: 3, 107824729: 3, 200107185: 3, 112035468: 3, 106694660: 2, 105951192: 2, 10232: 2, 106227557: 2, 12273: 2, 12117: 2, 105867264: 2, 106337255: 2, 107763137: 2, 105790555: 2, 106771928: 2, 106662570: 2, 106652601: 2, 106928203: 2, 106018444: 2, 10168: 2, 105851541: 2, 106554608: 2, 11156: 2, 107256299: 2, 106692154: 2, 108405768: 2, 107065373: 2, 106405973: 2, 107377680: 2, 111823817: 2, 106514856: 2, 200094293: 2, 112082839: 2, 107117061: 2, 106081147: 2, 107600470: 2, 111496831: 2, 106822110: 2, 108479343: 2, 108270652: 2, 109352136: 2, 106246445: 1}"

Pitch one climbs out of the grotto, traverses somewhat right on a ledge and then moves up the right-hand side of the face (adequate protection available) some 30 feet to a protection bolt.  From the first bolt, continue up to a second bolt another 30 feet up and then bear slightly left to a short crack that ends the pitch at a good-sized ledge and solid belay/rap bolts.  This pitch, although only 5.7, requires some care in placing pro.  It's also hard to see the bolts from the ground.      Pitch two climbs the obvious and rather steep crack system directly above the belay.  This pitch protects well.  The crux is a technical bulge which rates at easy 5.8.  Pitch two ends at a bolted belay/rap station just to the right of an off-width crack and just above a large ledge.

With varied climbing on very good rock this route mixes in some of the best Red Rock has to offer. A must do.    Pitch 1: Begin by heading up slabby face holds. Look for a line of holds leading right to the obvious flake. The traverse right to the flake is 5.9 and has no protection. Once you gain the flake good gear is had. Follow the system of flakes up and right. After a wider section of the flake traverse directly right on a finger/hand rail(top of a flake). This is the crux. Continue up and left to the fixed anchor. 5.10a, 135ft.    Pitch 2: Climb left off the belay to a fixed(and pretty good) Knifeblade. Climb past this and into the left facing corner with a stem box on the left forming a channel. Continue up this channel, where you will encounter the crux. Follow the crack system up until you reach the fixed anchor. 5.10a/b, 125ft.    Pitch 3: Climb up the left facing corner above. Liebacking and jamming will see you through. The rock on this pitch is incredible and the climbing is 5 stars. Belay at the fixed anchor on a sloping ledge. 5.10a, 100ft.    Pitch 4: Climb up and right into the corner. Climb the corner until you can step left to a perfect finger crack on the steep varnished wall. Do not step over to early it will be obvious. Climb the finger crack in perfect varnished rock.   At the top of the finger crack abit of face climbing will lead you up then back right into the corner and 2 drilled angles. Alternately you can continue up the corner. Supposedly this is a bit easier, however there is a big white block you must climb around that is suspect. Another 5 star pitch. 5.10b, 100ft.    Pitch 5: The Offwidth.

Rope up below the most central crack system on the cliff and it also has a prominent little porch of rock below. You can also add two more pitches (5.8 and 5.10d) to the four described here.  Pitch 1) -5.10d: Start climbing up moderate terrain directly below the roof that marks the crux of the first pitch. Get below the roof and do some cool opposition moves to gain your position below the roof. Undercling and stem out the right side and keep your eyes peeled for a key foothold out right. Move up easier ground to a two bolt anchor with a small stance.  Pitch 2) -5.10d: climb up a nice crack and layback until it is possible to traverse right towards a little corner/alcove below the main right facing corner that marks the meat of this fine pitch. Climb up the corner using small stoppers for pro, and fingertip laybacks for skills. This eventually eases off and turns into nice hand pods and secure flared locks for about 50 ft. End at a semi hanger with two new studs. Really rad pitch.  Pitch 3) 5.10b: This pitch starts off sorta shitty but I guess is worth while. Do a big reach out right off the anchor and start your grovel through some vegetation for about twenty feet to gain a weird flaring groove. Climb this and gain better ground eventually perching up below a decent sized roof. Do some trickery and bust out the left side of this roof. Then do some more balancy stuff to gain a nice ledge with two bolts for the anchor.  Pitch 4) 5.10b: This pitch can be done one of two three ways. The original line goes up the thin right facing corner off the belay and goes up and right toward a short left facing corner. You can also hand traverse out a thin rail, no feet (5.11) right off the belay and gain the 4th pitch of Jupiter II.  We however downclimbed out right off the belay and traversed until it is possible to grab a cool undercling and crank off a few locks and holds to gain the 4th pitch of Jupiter II as well. Anyway you go it's a decent pitch of climbing with more good rock. Climb up the face with cool holds and semi hollow flakes. Offset Aliens would be nice for this pitch but can totally be done without as well.  The climbing is pretty moderate and never desperate. Make your way up toward the little left facing corner and eventually climb up the arete of this to gain another two bolt anchor with suspect tat. Watch out for the two huge loose death blocks on the left side of the corner.

From the base, it is impossible to tell what awaits you in this chimney route, but there is much more than mere chimney moves.  Start out climbing thin friction moves on white rock to gain a 15 foot white colored detached looking pillar/boulder on the right side of the deep crack. Climb this carefully but with good pro (this is the only suspect rock on the whole climb). Above this, enter the obvious black varnished chimney. Make classic 5.8 chimney moves for about 30-35 feet. At this point one may escape out back onto the face on the climber's right side of the chimney to keep the grade at 5.8, or if you decide to remain in the chimney, it is probably more like 5.9.  Once you arrive at the top of the traditional chimney section, you will actually bridge your body over the ever widening chimney black chimney and move your way further back into it where there is an improbable looking roof. Working your feet up and right, you will find some previously unseen jugs which keep this fun roof move at 5.8. Once above the roof, you will find yet another improbable looking roof. From here, you will also look to work your way right with some creative moves to escape around the right side of this roof. From here, continue up the beautiful black cleft until reaching the anchor which is found on the far right side of Eagle Ledge.  We always climbed and descended this with two ropes. You may be able to use a single 70 meter to descend or you may to downclimb a little at the end.  Long, great movement on perfect black varnish, interesting and engaging 5.8 moves most of the way.

This route initially was full of friable suspect rock, but after climbing it a handful of times, began to clean up quite nicely.

Blue Feathers,108092745,Trad,106733374,5.10+,450,3,3.0,2.0,"This route was another Jack lets go climb that mountain and find a route thatll take us up.  We wanted to climb bridge mountain and saw our chance through a series of crack systems that appeared on the east side of Bridge Mountain.  Rather than climbing all the ridge stuff up to the east face proper we decided to cut some vertical distance out by taking the approach to upper gemstone gulley and then looking for any obvious signs of weakness in the wall to our right.  This route was quite the rockaneering adventure as we started hiking in toward the route at 4:00 in the morning.  Since the loop road didnt open until 6, we decided that hiking in the 2-3 miles on the road and then up the trail from the Pine Creek Canyon parking lot was the fastest way to access the rock.  Despite the early start, we didnt actually start climbing until 8:00  after four hours of hiking!    Pitch 1: Climb up the awkward start, avoiding bushes on the right.  Then continue up fun face climbing through the corner system and up towards the large chimney above.  Either move out right underneath the roof just before the cave or climb the east ground on the face and continue upward.  Squeeze through the birthcanal through into the cave. Build anchor in the cave, get great pictures of your second trying to squeeze through the hole with a backpack on! 50 m. 5.8 FUN!    Pitch 2: Climb over the blocks just within the entrance to the cave and then climb DOWN out the mouth (moving to the north) of the cave again but up the black patina that is out in the sun! Slot the rope up through the detached flake and pull on some awesome patina face holds.  Head straight up and a little left as the ground gets easier protection is a little sparse.  Pull past small corner with a few bushes, pass up obvious hand crack on the right and head left up easy ground to HUGE ledge.  Sling tree for anchor near the back of the ledge.  45 m 5.7. FUN!    Pitch 3.  From this ledge there was no obvious way UP but look around to the right and follow easy ledge system up and to the right. These ledges intersect with a gully system which cuts left again Climb up to level ledge and pass small tree on the right then look up and see obvious chimney/slot. A diagonal traverse through a two to four foot wide chimney for at least 70 feet with a couple spicy moves on brittle and sandy rock, then an aerobic double crack chimney section and quick rest ledge for about 20 feet. .  Then after this chimney the real action begins.  Walk back into the slot, reaching the bottom of a dead vertical corner. Youll come to a 40ish foot 5.10 hand / fist crack to a nice belay ledge  Thrutch through hard, awkward crack with small face holds (the crux) to a large ledge with HUGE boulder, build anchor below boulder. HARD, FUN! Beware loose rock and rope drag.  50 m.  5.10+.     Potential, from the belay it is possible to walk north and down climb to the base of another corner, which after two pitches should take you to the summit of the gendarme infront of the main east face of Bridge Mountain.  We chose not to continue climbing due to the lateness of the day and I injured my finger, taking a fall on the 3rd pitch.  This climb was super fun and could be continued all the way to the summit of bridge mountain!    Descent:   From the top of the third pitch, we did a double rope rappel to a large ledge with two trees (near the end of the ropes).  Then downclimbed to skiers left (where there is conveniently some webbing).  Follow some mixed cairns for a while and then continue your way down.  Probably possible to pop back over the ridge and go down the gemstone gully approach trail, we continued on down to the southwest - which it turns out is the actual gemstone gulley.  Reaching the top of a HUGE cliff, which we rapped from a slung tree.  Then continue on down the easiest line of descent, with two more rappels off of trees until reaching the ground and heading back toward the parking lot.      This route was a pleasure to climb.  Both Jack and I wish that we could have pushed it through to the summit, but we will return either to complete the route or check out a route that someone else has put up on this mountain. Yet again RR has amazing potential for those willing to pursue it.  ","{106759927: 3, 108018821: 3}"

Although ""20%"" might be the easiest route on the wall, the name may or may not refer to your chances of onsighting the most excellent and devious crux pitch. Good luck!  At the center of the wall, below Cold Front, is a beautiful, polished rock terrace, pleasantly verandaed by a large, solitary fir tree. Begin about 15 feet left of the tree beneath the right side of the lichen-speckled lower wall; careful inspection will reveal a high bolt which can also be easily observed by standing at the start of Jet Stream/Airhead/Atmospheres and looking straight right.  P1 (100’, 5.10): Things start off with a bang: Scramble up some easy ground, clip the first bolt and immediately leap for a flat jug just above it. Fun! Continue up the slab above, navigating an easy run out to a well-protected high crux. Move left and up to an anchor on a comfortable ledge. Five bolts protect. This pitch is enjoyable despite having a lot of lichen. The best holds are clean, but figuring out which ones those are from below is challenging.  P2 (130’, 5.11d): Move right to an architecturally interesting low-angle corner and begin climbing, back cleaning any pro you might place until you can clip the first of five bolts with a shoulder-length runner. From here step back left around the arete to a stance on the main face. Decode a tenuous, extended crux up a steep slab before finally gaining a good rest. From here, move up to the obvious arching flake and follow this as it steepens to a difficult and sequential second crux (A #5 or #6 Brass Offset is necessary if you wish to have pro close by or need to aid the crux). Continue more easily up to a right-trending ramp which leads to a good belay stance.  P3 (90’, 5.11a): Move back down the ramp to regain the crack system and follow this to a bolt protecting a thin flake. Continue up a funky shallow corner passing two more bolts before committing to an exciting stretch of climbing up and right across a varnished face to a fantastic belay ledge high on the wall.  P4 (140’, 5.10): Carefully work up a loose cleft towards the ominous bomb bay chimney above. Don’t worry, the rock improves dramatically a little higher! From a hand jam and a key #1 Camalot placement, traverse rightwards before executing some seriously weird and strenuous moves to get up into the chimney. With creativity this section is probably 10c but it may feel harder without good beta. Chimney up really nice varnish until the chimney closes into a hand and finger crack in a right-facing corner.

Move left to underclings, then pull up over the roof and step around the corner to the left and belay on a foot ledge (or link into the next pitch). The crux is V4 and this pitch is well-protected.    P4 (5.9, 90'): Climb up a series of hollow flakes, eventually working left to a semi-hanging belay beneath the amazing corner. Extend the belay to a stance 10' below this anchor for maximum comfort and use the anchor as the first protection point when climbing the next pitch.    P5 (5.11a, 140'): This is the glory pitch - a magnificent black varnished corner providing several technical cruxes and thought-provoking but good gear. Climb through the first crux immediately above the belay, and continue up the corner. Higher there is a well-protected, tricky corner switch to the right, then some great, exposed moves up the arete separating the corners lead to yet another pretty corner.

Drifting is one such route, and given that it is relatively new, it proves that Red Rocks still has much untapped potential. The route is largely up perfect rock, has a lot of variety, and a few outrageous sections. Bolted right where it needs to be, this route has demanding climbing both mentally and physically, and is thoroughly enjoyable.  Begin on the large, open face just right of the main Jet Stream Wall at a pine tree growing near the base of the route. Scramble up a right-leaning ramp past an obvious bush to a bolted belay atop a flake and below a small roof.

Also, this rap requires a difficult pendulum to reach the anchors. Use an autoblock for this rap and tie knots in the ends!

The leftmost station is located on a small ledge below the middle belay - it is a good place to belay for the next pitch, but would create serious drag.  Either move the belay left or belay off the middle station for P6.      P6: Begin up good edges on a short wall left of the belay.

He doesn't really understand why people avoid the place in the summer. For this reason, when an ambitious and eager climber named Jeff Raymond actually wanted to climb in Red Rock on his birthday (July 2), Larry immediately went into action, pulling from his 'list' something appropriate to do along with recruiting another climber or two to make it a party for Jeff on his birthday.     After two more friends decided to join us, the plan was set- a new line up the Community Pillar in Pine Creek canyon.  It should be noted that loose rock is present on the 5th pitch, thus making this pitch serious for the grade (or encouraging a detour onto the variation listed below).     About 150 feet left of Community Pillar is an obvious crack system.  About 30 feet further left is a short chimney leading to a left-facing, varnished corner.

Community Pillar,105732959,Trad,115004406,5.9,700,8,3.4,133.0,"This is a beautiful line directly up the middle of the Community Pillar formation.  There are many opportunities for variations, and you could climb the route several times and have widely differing experiences.  The choices aren't always obvious, so some explanation is in order.    The start: The ""normal"" start is in enclosed chimney and goes behind the right side of a huge (cabin-sized) chockstone. This is very tight and scary for a big guy, but the slender and flexible seem to scamper right up. Those fearing claustrophobic death have a few options.  Benjamin Smith (see below) suggests a chimney to the left of the chockstone as shown in this                My suggested first pitch of community pillar.      . I have heard of people climbing on the outside of the huge chockstone (passing it on the left), but have no first-hand experience.  In all these cases, the route continues up the wide crack above the chockstone to a large ledge and easy ground beneath a deep chimney.  This point can also be reached by a variation start which bypasses the chockstone and its associated squeezes: climb a 5.8 corner about 30 yards to the right (west) of the normal start.    The next pitch goes up the easy ground and enters the deep chimney, bearing right at the overhang.  The tunnel at its top is pleasant and roomy.  Belay at the large ledge.    There are two choices above. On the right is a long crack and squeeze chimney with limited protection (5.8). To the left, you can ascend some blocks to a clean, varnished hand crack.  This is generally considered 5.9, but is better protected than the wide crack.  Both options lead to a small ledge beneath a steep, featured crack. Another pitch up this crack takes you to a belay in a surprisingly extensive cave.    Again there are many ways to continue.  The obvious-looking (but not recommended) ""window"" to the right leads west to Cartwright Corner and substantially harder climbing.  It is possible to step back out of the cave entrance and climb the unprotected face on hollow-sounding flakes.  Another way is to climb straight up the crack in the cave and move left via some peculiar bomb bay moves and go through a narrow portal leading back to the outside and an easier crack.  Probably the best option is to continue up the crack (bearing slightly right at the portal) and heading toward the apparent dead-end at the cave's roof.  An unseen squeezeway at the top leads to an opening through the rubble into the floor of another cave above.  This is the the upper belay spot for all the cave variations of this pitch.    Climbing above this point leads through an obvious opening above and follows progressively easier climbing to broken ground and the unroping spot.    DESCENT:   From the top, scramble to the right (west) to a pine tree in an area of broken rock.  Rappel cautiously, then scramble down to the small saddle separating this formation from the Magic Triangle to the west.  The most common descent these days is to rappel the gully to the north (which can be done with a few 30-meter rappels).  The original descent involves scrambling south and going down the Crabby Appleton approach gully with a few short rappels.    An alternative descent, using double 60m ropes, goes via rap stations on Chocolate Flakes.  Scramble to the south to a pine tree in an area of broken rock. Rappel west on one rope. Scramble north to a large obvious pine tree to make a second rappel on one rope - this second rap going north and landing on a ledge with bushy vegetation.  You are now roughly at about the same elevation as the the top anchor of Chocolate Flakes. Go through / skirt above bushes on skier's ~right for 10 or 20 feet (?), then scramble up and over to the east on ledges; i.e., do not fully go down the revealed gully on trodden tree-bush trunks and limbs. If this traverse is done correctly, you will end up on a broad sloping ledge with bolted rap anchors about six feet below on a steep face that faces east - the top anchor of Chocolate Flakes.  Do three double-rope raps to the ground. The first two are around 55 or 60 meters each; on them, you will pass up bolted anchors at about 30 meters (they'd be hanging belays / rap stations).

The left margin of this prominent central feature on the north face of Magic Mountain is a dark chimney halfway up. This is the Honeycomb Chimney and is the main landmark of this route. Start at the far left side of the broad base of the buttress.  Pitch 1: A short pitch leads through some fragile rock and a chimney to a good belay ledge beneath a dark offwidth crack.  Pitch 2: Start up the wide crack, but exit right onto easy face climbing up solid varnished potholes. Move back to the crack and pull over a small bulge (5.7) to an easy chimney. (If you don't have a 60-meter rope, you should probably belay at the bulge.)  Pitch 3: Class 3 climbing leads up the broken gully to the base of a huge dark chimney.  Pitch 4: High quality climbing on the varnished honeycomb takes you to the top of the chimney. (5.7)  Pich 5: Climb up and slightly left to the constricted slot above you. A bit of fiddling with large cams in pockets gives some amount of protection for the squeeze moves (5.8) through the slot. Continue up and left on easy rock, belaying just above a small tunnel.  Pitch 6: Class 4 scrambling leads left and a little down for about 100 feet across a broken ledge system.  Pitch 7: Climb the spectacular corner (5.9) to a large ledge.  At this point you can descend by walking right (west) and joining the standard Community Pillar descent where it rappels from the pine tree. Alternatively, you can climb another pitch:  Pitch 8: Scramble up for 50 feet (class 3) over loose rock to the base of a small but clean corner. Go straight up the crack (5.7) and through the chimney in the giant split boulder to a belay on the summit ridge.  The descent from here does not involve any rappels, but it is not trivial (and probably not recommended in the darkness). Turn left (east), and work along the right (southern) side of the ridge, following a path of least resistance through the rocks and brush. Work your way up until almost at the true summit of Magic Mountain (a summit cairn is visible), then descend to the south.

Your rope will hit the water on the way down if you don't take care. You can rap with a single 60 m rope using the anchor of Chasing Shadows/Edge Dressing. No need for 2 60m ropes.   P1- 5.5s two good bolts to the anchor on the first pitch  P2- (P1 & P2) can be done as one pitch(170 ft). Take the right facing desert varnished dihedral from the bolt anchor (5.7; 60 ft), move left to the the belay anchors.  P3- 5.8 from the anchor continue up the great crack system with some stemming to another anchor (120 ft)  P4- 5.8 from the anchor break out right onto the curving crack and follow it to the final anchor beneath the giant roof.  Careful on the way down not to get the ropes caught in the crack as you rap.","{106949749: 4, 106958966: 4, 106486112: 4, 106227557: 4, 12403: 4, 10232: 4, 11926: 4, 12434: 4, 106736701: 4, 106782341:

Excellent Adventure,105732668,Trad,115004598,5.11b,400,3,3.8,47.0,"Excellent Adventure is a fantastic, memorable rock climb.  It's full of great moves, airy postions, fiddley gear, and exciting runouts.  The only two detractors from this being a neo-classic are that the second and third pitches feel ever so slightly contrived (although the climbing is still very good) and the fact that Mike Tupper's homemade hangers seem quite dubious.    The climb starts right off of the water pools at the base of the Dark Shadows wall.  It's worth taking some time to identify the correct line:  There are four routes that take off from this area, each with two bolts up the water-polished slab.  The right-most one, with nice modern hangers, departs from the boulder above the waterfall and is the famous Dark Shadows.  Next is Sandstone Sandwich, which is best approached by traversing in from the boulder.  It has modern hangers as well.  The next one is Excellent Adventure which currently has homemade hangers.  Finally, the left-most is Risky Business.  All of these bolts can be hard to pick out without careful inspection.    P1:  Step onto some rocks and then up onto the face immediately below the homemade hangers.  You are aiming for the right end of a white roof about 75' up.  Climb the slab easily to the second bolt, then perform a difficult move (5.10) past this bolt and continue up to the edge of the roof.  Pull the roof a few feet left of the right edge onto a steep face and a tips crack of sorts.  Climb up past a bolt or two until you can trend left into an easy right-diagonalling crack system.  Follow this to a spacious belay ledge that gives good views of Dark Shadows.    P2:  Step directly left off the belay around the blunt arete and up to a bolt.  Swain's description speaks of down climbing but this is unnecessary.  Climb up to a second bolt (tough move immediately before the clip) then head almost straight left to easier ground.  The moves left from this bolt are the crux of the climb and check in at about 5.11b/c (this section felt slightly contrived as the bolts force you to avoid easier, more obvious climbing).  Continue up past more bolts to easier climbing.  The rock here is steep and the gear spacing is sporty!  Right when things get blank again you can step left around a blunt arete to the anchor.  Do not step left too soon and do not belay at the nice modern-bolted station that is a part of Risky Business.    P3:  This is the psychological crux of the route - great climbing but a lot of 5.10 moves way out from gear.  Contrary to Swain's description, this is not scary for the second at all (solid TR the whole time) - definately put the cool-headed leader on this pitch.  Also, the scale/proportions in his topo for this pitch are way off: it would appear in the topo that there are only four bolts (instead of five) and that after you clip the last one you head straight left for a long ways.  In actuality, after you clip the last bolt, you go straight up for a long ways, and you don't have to go all that far left to reach the anchor.  Here's the description:  Climb up off the belay past four bolts with homemade hangers.  The line of bolts trend out right over the huge Heart of Darkness roof.  The fourth clip is a tough one.  From here you'll see an old stud out right (ignore this), and an obvious 5th bolt directly above.  Head up to this fifth bolt.  Take a deep breath and punch it for 30+ feet of 5.10 climbing straight up the face to a horn and overlap (alternatively, it is possible to clip the 5th bolt, then downclimb a move or two then head almost directly right (5.10+/5.11- moves) 15' to a huge hole in the rock.  From here climb up about 10-20', then traverse back left along a natural line of holds until you are directly above (by 15-20 feet or so) the 5th bolt again.  Continue up to the aformentioned horn and overlap ).  Load the overlap up with thank-God gear and get a good shake, then continue straight up on more neat 5.10 climbing past several RP placements.  After about 20 feet you'll see the angle of the face eases off - pull up onto a ledge system and walk a few feet to your left to the Risky Business/Excellent Adventure anchors.    Yee Haw!

I've heard from numerous people that it has been climbed before (during AMGA Rock Guide Exams), so I'm not claiming a first ascent.  Also, it isn't so much a route, as it is a variation on a route.  I just think it would be nice to put a name to this worthwhile variation to top out on the Mescalito.    If you happen to have a little energy left and psyche after climbing whatever you climbed to get here, you should really go for the Extra Credit.    The climbing itself starts out as finger jams/laybacking for 10 feet before a key hold allows you to pull up and rest.  From here, off fingers/thin hands/laybacking lead for another 15 feet before another nice rest.  A quick hand jam or two will bring you back into 20 feet of off finger/thin hands, before easing off.","{107786859: 3, 10168: 3, 111284682: 3}"

Negro Blanco,107655437,Trad,115004598,5.10c,1000,10,1.0,1.0,"This is a long, loose, runout route that climbs a white flake system - a feature that is obvious for most of the approach - up the left margin of the Dark Shadows Wall.  Begin at the left edge of the wall, just right of a huge cave-like alcove.    P1: Climb a long right-facing corner before stepping left and up into the monster chimney above.  Move up this, at first easily, then with more difficulty.  There is protection available in the back, but the feature forces you to climb away from it, so difficulty/tedium may be inversely proportionate to your boldness.  Nevertheless, a shaky #6 Camalot provides protection on the way to bomber gear at the very top of the chimney.  Pull out of the chimney to a stance, then lieback a flake/arête feature passing good nut placements.  Just below a stretch of white rock, traverse left on fragile holds into a right-facing corner.  Climb easily up this and set up a belay where convenient.  5.10c, 150'.

P3: Face climb up the varnished wall right of the corner, eventually moving back into the corner and following this for a very long pitch until the corner/crack dwindles.  Belay on gear. 5.8.

P5-10: Follow the corner system as it gradually turns into a right-trending ramp, then continue up the face and cracks above until the angle of the wall lessens, eventually turning into a scramble to the summit of the Mescalito.  5.8 R.    This route has a notorious reputation thanks to a huge fall that a young Lynn Hill took on the first pitch after breaking a hold (various accounts described the whipper, which was arrested by a small hex in grainy rock, as anywhere between 40 and 60 feet).  I found the first pitch to be reasonably well-protected (from the point where Lynn fell, she must have skipped several bombproof wire placements  easy to do while liebacking, although perhaps the smallest straight-sided nuts of day would not have been viable).  Nevertheless, the seriousness of this route is realized on the higher pitches where, between the loose corner systems and cracks, stretches of face climbing up portable holds and scarce (solid) pro await.  Apparently sometime after the FA the route was retrobolted (see the quote below), but these bolts must have since been chopped as we only saw one (at the P2 belay).  While this route is a bold and adventurous first ascent, it is far from classic by any other measuring stick.  However, the style in which it was completed is impressive when compared to either the heavy-handed bolting or the bolt-free big wall headpoints that are common in Red Rocks today.  John Long mentions the FA of Negro Blanco in this little anecdote from SuperTopo:    I first visited Red Rocks as a senior in high school  drawn there by the original pioneer, Joe Herbst, who was something of a mentor to Richard Harrison and me way back then (The Bronze Age).  There was no loop road  just an incomprehensible matrix of old dirt wagon roads that got you within a few miles of Velvet Canyon, et al.  The dirt roads were treacherous and pot-holed and washed out and we could barely use them in Joe's tired old VW bus.  It took big time to even gain the cliffs, and since bolts were pretty much verboten, we were on pins and poor nuts (all nuts were poor back then).  Scared the shit out of us climbing there back then.    With that gear and being so remote, those cliffs were really intimidating.  I didn't go back till '78.  There was a loop road then, and a bunch of new routes.  Guys were bolting up stuff but the place still was intimidating.  No sport routes yet because the natural lines were still there to do, and plenty of them.  We free climbed Levitation, and did a few other longish trad routes.  One, I think it was Negro Blanco, was really necky, about ten pitches long and no bolts.  Lynn Hill took a bona fide 50 footer leading the second pitch.      I went back ten years later and the route had about fifty bolts on it (""modernized"" they called it).  Now there is a plan to build homes on the flanks of this great wilderness, and it really has to stop.      Climbing in the Red Rocks used to be like venturing to the Middle of Nowhere  really radical and exciting if not terrifying.  We've got to try and preserve a little of that for later generations, so I'm all for supporting this drive to ban development, by any means.  Else it will all be gone.  Believe it.",{10168: 1}

P1 (150', 5.7): Climb a grey slab under the large, dark roof. Move right using two grooves (tricky pro) and pass the roof on the right. There is an optional bolted belay here on a compact ledge just left of an obvious, large scrub oak. From this belay, move left to a varnished, right-facing corner and follow this as it turns into a hueco-lined weakness which can be climbed to a bolted anchor at the lower left end of an expansive white slab.    P2 (205', 5.9): From this belay DO NOT head directly up to a bolted anchor visible overhead; instead, traverse way right across the open slabs via ledges and low angle rock. You're aiming for a left-facing corner/flake with a thin crack. This is quite far to the right and above you, but clearly visible from the belay. Once there, climb this crack to a bolted anchor which is NOT visible from the previous belay. This is a long, rope-stretching pitch!    P3 (200', 5.9): Climb a steep featured flake above the belay and continue up a series of ledges to the base of the steep, black wall above. Wander up the right side of this face, ignoring a bolted anchor you may see off to the left about halfway up the face (though you can optionally belay here) and continue up the face above as the angle eases off. Keep climbing to another anchor. This is another long pitch.    P4 (90', 5.7): Step left from the belay and climb a seam up a wide open face, passing a bolt that protects a cruxy slab move, to reach a bolted anchor on a good ledge with a small tree.    P5 (90', 5.7): Climb the varnished cleft/chimney system passing an intermediate anchor and then up the face right of the chimney system to a bolted anchor.    P6 (90', 5.7): Step left and continue up the cleft/chimney, moving left at the top to an anchor on a sloping stance.    (Note: For expediency, one can easily link pitches 4 & 5, or pitches 5 & 6.)    P7 (130', 5.9): From the belay work up and left towards a smooth gully that is capped by a massive roof. Climb the wall right of the gully passing two or three bolts and on to an anchor at the top of the wall.    Rap the route with two ropes.

Splitter locker fingers. Need I say more? Due to some other reviews/comments, I am going to revise this statement. I will say this is the best finger crack I have done in Red Rock..    Details:    Approach as per Deep Space. We chose the climber left side of the triangle rubble heap getting up to the route start. If you choose to pitch this out, it's about 200 feet of mostly 4th class with a little bit of 5th class mixed in. Call it pitches 1 & 2. This will land you at the top of the rubble triangle heap (as it appears in the Handren guide book picture).     Pitch 3: From the top of the rubble heap, when you look up, you will see a line of bolts going up the face to the left of the chimneys of deep space. This is the first true pitch of the climb. Follow the bolt line up the face, over a bulge (crux), and up committing slabs (trending left) to the base of the finger crack. This pitch ends on a nice ledge with a bolted anchor. 9-10 bolts, 180 feet, 5.10b/c and spicy.    Pitch 4: The money pitch. Follow the amazing and sustained splitter finger crack for ~100 feet up the face. About 50 feet up this pitch, as one crack peters out, switch to another splitter crack (transition protected by a bolt) and continue up excellent edging and finger locks. Before you know it, you will be at a steeper section of the face (possibly slightly overhanging). Continue up this section (crux) to a roof. Pull over the roof with bomber hand jams (#3 camalot) and continue about 10 feet to a heavy duty chain anchor/hanging belay.

There are a few options, I will recount our path, and I tried to follow what I thought was the ""5.5-Regular Route"". If you were looking to practice route finding and adventure climb skills, this one I thought was pretty good.     P1 220' Begin on the right side of the tall rectangular pillar topped with bushes. Go up, passing a belay in a smooth varnished chimney with a rap station on the left. Continue up and eventually belaying in a alcove on the right face filled with a chockstone with inumerable amounts of old nylon and a locker. Back it up with a small cam.     P2 150' Go up over whichever path you chose, mostikely going over a bulge on white rock above your gear and run over easy ground to the top of the bushy ledge. I slung a large shaggy tree passed a nut, rings, and inordinate amount of slings, as continuing around the tree and rope drag was somewhat annoying with all the traversing.     P3 140' Up the face to a crack and then mostly right, to a wrist-sized tree with old slings. You can build a belay under the flake ahead. Here you will find out why all the slings are probably here.     P4 50' To your right is a white rock chimney, with a classic RR hard start then unsustained climbing up past bushes. Above the aforementioned belay flake, there is a peculiar and awkward set of moves off the ground to surmount the bulge to traverse left. Well protected, just remember to put a piece in so your follower doesn't swing if they get cold feet. Traverse 30-40' left and up to a right leaning crack. Belay on finger sized pieces.     P5 +-300ft go up the face/crack with sparse gear on easy terrain to a wide white crack. Odd, off-balanced and fun.  It's easy, but you're 15' a bit run out from your gear here. A few sandy-smeary moves and you can place a #4 above you to feel good about going around the loose pillar. Be careful. Go right to keep the rope from pulling on the block, and get ready for some unprotected terrain. There might have been gear around there, it just seemed like I would have needed to wander for sub-par placements. Up to a 4th class chimney, some gear and up past a long sling and fatty rap ring. Why would anyone try to rappel from here? Belay where available.     P6 -+200' Unrope and make your way up to the Red Cap and final chimney.     P7 120' Climb the chimney to rap station, and wonder why you're covered in black ants. They are everywhere!    Make your way up and around to the summit.","{107394785: 4, 108177328: 2, 107022803: 2}"

Pick your way thru the terrance above by going up it's right side. You'll head back left(south) across the top of the terrace, the start of the climb is a flat area of dirt and rocks in between some bush's, it is very obvious. You will be below an obvious, hanging, flared chimney that is orange/white in color, this feature is located on the second pitch.    Pitch #1- Head up the plated face aiming for the left side and a bulge leading to an obvious thin crack. Surmount the bulge(on the left) at 5.10a R.

Once on top of the bulge you will be at a very good stance. There is a fixed piton in the crack above. Ascend the finger crack (5.10c) to a small, good stance directly below the chimney and the bolt on pitch 2. There are 2 stances here and you want to be on the lower of the 2. You'll need several 1"" piece to belay here. The crux moves aren't as obvious as they sound...look around. (5.10c, R-110').    Pitch #2- Start up the chimney and clip the bad bolt(there is very good gear available to back it up). After clipping the bolt traverse left onto the obvious varnished face. DO NOT CLIMB THE CHIMNEY! Climb up the face at 5.9, there is at least 1 good gear placement on the face but it is not super obvious. At the top of the chimney there is a roof and there will be an obvious place to step across the chimney to the crack on the right side of the roof. Follow this perfect finger/hand/fist crack for another 100'. When the crack becomes a bomb bay chimney look up and left for an obvious stance on the outside wall. There is a very good bolt here with a brown hanger, this and a very good nut are the belay. Warning!! There are a couple of inobvious, loose blocks at this stance, watch what you are kicking!

There are several option for belaying/descending from here. If you'd like to climb the last pitch of cat in the hat you'll want to watch for a ""cavey"" area directly below the obvious crux pitch of CITH. There are sling's around a boulder on a ledge, it's about 200' between the pitch 2 belay and this spot. Then continue on CITH and descend as for the same. If you want to skip the last pitch of CITH you can easily traverse in to the ""pancake"" belay and start rapping. This is about 210' from the pitch 2 belay and will require some simul climbing. A third option exists, however I have not done it. Apparently you can head up and right to the obvious tree in the rock. From this tree you can rap onto the route ""Pine Nuts"" and then use the anchors on this route to rappel the east face landing you back very near your pack.

Y2K,105732287,Trad,115004550,5.10a,400,4,2.9,272.0,"This is an outstanding route that is usually less crowded than other routes in RR of the same quality. It is possible to climb only the crux first pitch and rap with double ropes but the whole climb is fun and interesting; especially the fourth.  Y2K is located on the north-east corner of the Mescalito. On the approach, spot a pinkish dihedral that has a sharp curve to the right in it. To the right of this dihedral is a bolted face that leads to a roof. This is the route.  P1: 5.10a, 150' Begin atop a large boulder leaning against the face. Climb up past several bolts to the overhang. Turn the overhang (crux) and continue up the crack and face to a bolted belay. The crux is very well protected with a bolt and you can place a good cam just above the bolt.  P2: 5.8, 160' Climb straight up the face to a huge ledge and a double-bolt belay. There are two ledges here; one stepped above the other.  P3: 5.5, 50' Traverse straight right to a nice belay alcove at the base of a right facing corner and build a gear anchor.  P4: 5.9, 150' Climb the stellar right facing corner. Near the top, the crack goes from thin to non-existent and pro becomes a bit tricky. Step left onto a ledge and belay from the anchors. I'd give this pitch a PG rating but it is superb.

Cat in the Hat,105732419,Trad,115004583,5.6,650,6,3.1,958.0,"This route is probably the most popular multi-pitch route in Red Rocks, and always seems to be swarming with parties.  For many years I avoided the route because it always seemed mobbed.  Then, on a day when the wind was screaming down the canyon we figured nobody would be on it.  Wrong!  Another party at the base.  We still had a fun time and everyone was very friendly and nobody was in a rush.  Good to adopt this attitude on this route - if it's high season it's going to be crowded.    This route faces south and can get quite hot.  It can be done on a sunny winter day and you could die of heat stroke in the summer.    Hike the trail to where the two forks of Pine Creek join at the base of Mescalito.  Here you want to take the left (south) fork.  Follow a trail on the north bank past a prominent buttress, then curve right up a broad, bushy gully to the base of the route.  The first pitch  faces southwest and is in the shade in early morning, it cannot be seen from the parking lot.    P1&2: Follow a 5.6 crack up and left (4"" piece can be useful at one point if you want really good pro).  At 110' you hit a 2 bolt anchor, but you can continue to the next anchor (60m rope better for this).  The next bolted anchor is off to the right on a ledge, we missed it on the way up.  It is easy to get sucked left into a gully, where you can just belay from gear.  [Many parties still split this long pitch into two]    This next part is not well described in Swain: wander up and right on a huge terrace to the highest point on the ledge.  This is 3rd class except for maybe the first move, and we downclimbed it unroped on the way down, but many people choose to stay roped up for it.    P3: You are aiming for a tree at the top of a gully, make a weird boulder problem off the deck and then continue more easily up the gully to the tree, 5.5, 70'.    P4: The wall steepens.  Climb a thin crack in a black face and step left below a roof.  Follow another crack all the way up to a block slung with slings, 5.6, 150'.    P5: Above here you see some bolts, this is the 10d direct variation, go for it if you want!  The normal finish is to go down from the belay and traverse right around the corner.  Keep traversing until you are to the base of a beautiful crack in the center of a black wall, 5.3 50'.    P6: Climb the crack, angle right to a bolt, and then up a face (somewhat runout) to a 2 bolt belay, 5.6 100'.  We combined P5 and P6 with a 50m rope but this makes the final runout moves of P6 harder with all the rope drag.    You can continue to the summit of Mescalito from here (many pitches mostly 3rd and 4th with some 5th class), but virtually all rap: First 130' to the top of pitch 4 (lots of rope drag to pull, plus knobs to catch the rope, some recommend doing this as a 50' rap to an intermediate bolted anchor and then an 80' rap to the top of pitch 4).  Second rappel 140' from the big block to the tree at the top of pitch 3.  Third rappel 70' from the tree to the big ledge.  Scramble down the ledge to the bolts at the top of the second pitch (this down scramble is a little tricky at the end, watch out, maybe belay beginners).  Fourth rappel 150' from the bolts at the top of the second pitch, angling left (north) to make the ground.  We experienced bad rope drag pulling this one too and perhaps it is better to do use the  bolts atop pitch 1 to split it up into two.  I believe you could rap this with only one 60m rope EXCEPT for the second rappel.

This somewhat runout line can be found just left of the first pitch of Cat in the Hat.  It is likely that this route has been used in the past in order to pass slow parties on Cat in the Hat.      Approach as for Cat in the Hat.  From the base of Cat in the Hat, this route can be found approximately thirty feet to the left.    Ascend mildy friable rock with a few bands of solid black rock in between.  The route generally works its way right and up to the first set of bolts on Cat in the Hat.  There are only a few good pro placements so take advantage of them when they appear.    From the anchors one may continue up Cat in the Hat or rappel.","{108489261: 2, 13816: 1, 105834012: 0, 106128846: 0}"

However you have to do some scary runout face climbing on pitch 3 to get to it. All in all it is a fun journey right next to one of the busiest routes in Red Rock    This is how I climbed it :    Pitch 1 : ""Delicately"" climb the crunchy face just up and left of Cat in the Hat;  which I don't  recommend as the few gear placements you will find are not that great. This pitch is also known as the 1st pitch of ""the Grinch"" or ""Cat in the Phat"". A better option is to climb the 1st pitch of Cat in the Hat to the large ledge to 3 bolts; skipping the bolt first anchor.    Pitch 2 : 5.7 (200'+) Climb the nice looking handcrack 15' left of the anchor. Follow crack to beautiful low angle dihedral to a ledge passing a scrub oak with old slings.  Continue scrambling past another small tree and then up face on the right to another small ledge with scrub oak and more webbing. Gear anchor in thin crack, small nuts and blue or black alien.    Pitch 3 : 5.8 (120') The somewhat scary runout pitch. Find your way up and left on the face to a traversing ledge.  Keep calm and climb on, the face maybe a little heady but it is never really that hard.  Build anchor at the start of the amazing crack.    Pitch 4 : 5.7 (60') The reason you climbed this route in the first place. Jam the 2-4"" crack in the dihedral to a ledge below a chimney; face holds out left make climbing easier. Sling tree for anchor. I climbed the chimney for another pitch; but unless you plan on finding your way to the summit i recommend rapping from here.",{110777198: 2}

P5 - 130ft 5.10b PG13 Get into the corner and pull over the bulge. It is possible to get an rp (HB #4 or similar) in a blind placement high up in the corner before committing to the crux moves. I was just able to reach (6ft with +2"" ape index) and had practiced the moves before on top rope. A fall from this point would land you hard on the slab below. For the benefit of future parties we left a nut (#5 BD slightly higher than the rp placement) with a long sling that can be clipped before pulling the bulge. Don't clip it if you don't want to.

Orange Clonus,106095101,Trad,105732060,5.11a,600,4,2.7,56.0,"Orange Clonus is a wonderful traditional multipitch climb.  It has a good variety of face and crack climbing with excellent position and exposure.  Also a plus, all belays are on huge ledges if done in 4 pitches.  The heart of the route is a huge 200 foot widening splitter which may be done in as little as 1 pitch or in as many as 3 which is what the guidebook suggests.  The nature of the climbing and the non-trivial descent make for a fun adventure.    P1 (100ft, 10d): The first pitch is the technical crux of the route.  Climb the clean varnished dihedral past 5 bolts to a small ledge (10d).  Continue up the corner on more fragile rock to a big ledge with a tree (5.7).    P2 (150 ft, 5.5R): Carefully climb the very delicate and runout face for 20 feet until you reach a wide crack which you can chimney inside.  Continue until you reach an enormous ledge at the base of a chimney.  Belay with a great view.    P3 (80ft, 5.8): Avoid the ugly chimney by going  straight up the steep face (5.8) to a ledge system.  Walk rightwards across the ledge, battling trees and other desert flora (2nd class).  Belay underneath the obvious crack system.    P4 (200ft, 10d): The heart of the route.  Climb the widening splitter crack for 200 feet.  The pitch ends when the crack ends, at a huge ledge.  (Alternatively, this pitch may be broken into three pitches as the guidebook suggests: 60ft of 5.8 fingers to a piton belay in a slot; 60 feet of 10d thin hands to a belay in an alcove below a roof; 80 feet up the 10a hands and fist crack to the big ledge.)    Descent: Three rappels and downclimbing into The Beer and Ice Gully.   Rap 1: Walk across the ledge and rap off a tree.   Rap 2: Downclimb to the right (towards the gully) to another ledge and rap station at a tree.   Rap 3: A short rappel off of another tree will get you to the ground.

Aquarium,113755995,Trad,106067892,5.8,1200,10,3.0,10.0,"Both the Handren and the Supertopo guides make this route sound a lot harder and scarier than it is. In reality, it’s a great long moderate with good protection. However, both the approach and the exit off the top of the tower make for a full and adventurous day. It may be possible to combine some of the pitches with careful rope management.    P. 1: Climb the slot chimney to a great, huge flat ledge. 5.5,150’    P. 2: The original route apparently climbs a 5.9 flake that’s quite a bit to the right, then traverses back left, but it’s a lot more obvious to go straight up the slab, left on a ramp, and up a corner to a nice stance on a pedestal below a wide section. (This is the third pitch of Luna.) 5.6, 60’     P. 3: Both Handren and Supertopo describe the start of this pitch as unprotected 5.9, but the gear is quite good and the climbing is never above 5.8 (at most). Stem up the obvious wide section, placing the #6 when convenient, then continue up the crack. Step right when the crack gets brushy and climb the crack and corner system on the right, passing a bolt, to a bolted belay/rappel anchor at a good stance on the right. 5.8, 120’    P. 4: Continue up the right-leaning crack, then traverse right (there are a couple of opportunities) to a corner with a hand crack, and follow it to any of several possible belay stances. 5.6 or 5.7 depending on reach, 150’    P. 5: Climb up and traverse left around a bulge, then follow an easy right-leaning corner to a stance below an obvious offwidth section. 5.6, 60’    P. 6: Pass the short offwidth section by face climbing on the right (a #6 gives toprope protection), then continue up the crack on much more moderate climbing to a good stance. 5.7-5.8, 80’    P. 7: Traverse straight left on easy ledges (passing about 20’ above the top anchor of Luna), then climb the varnished face left of a big corner to a stance. 5.6, 80’    P. 8: More or less straight up, passing a short varnished headwall down low, on mostly easy white rock with limited protection opportunities. Near the top, a #.75 Camalot in a horizontal protects a short set of face moves; continue up to a good ledge at the base of a wide crack. 5.6-5.7, 210’    P. 9: Up the wide crack, then step left and go up easy ground through a wide notch. Continue up easy ground on the left side of the notch to the summit of the tower. 5.6, 200’ (It’s easy to split this pitch by belaying in the notch.)    P. 10: But wait, there’s more! Easy but poorly protected downclimbing leads to a step across to the main wall. 5.4, 60’. From here, 4th-class climbing leads to easy ground. Both Handren and Supertopo mention a fixed rappel to get down the downclimbing section, but we saw no sign of one.","{106095990: 4, 111821616: 4, 109373073: 4, 110098525: 4, 105951805: 3, 200188254: 3, 111229002: 3, 200601023: 3, 111108703: 1, 108746269: 1}"

Delightful climbing ascends the corner to a stance where the crack widens to hand size.  Pitch 2 follows the crack to its end, then frictions up and left to another crack, eventually belaying beneath a steeper section.

The direct start is hard (5.10?) but there are easier variations on the adjacent face.  Three pitches up the chimney system lead to an exit on the right.  The fourth pitch continues straight up the rounded buttress above, passing a few delicate moves to a belay stance near an obvious diagonal crack.  Go right along the diagonal, then up to a small stance on the side of a chimney.  A long pitch up the chimney leads to the top.

P1 5.8 (Scary Larryesque / Herbsty) 115': Up the chimney. The initial roof goes easier than you might expect, but then things gradually escalate. Suspect rock at times contributes to an adventurous pitch. Upon exit from the chimney climb ten more feet over a bulge to chain anchors.  P2 5.7 125': Move left 8' to the left hand crack system and launch straight up for ~120' until a belay is convenient ~30-40' below a tree up and left.  P3 5.7 190': Move up and left close to the tree but then launch up and right following the right trending crack / ramp. When you see bolted anchors to the left set a belay just under a steeper headwall with a mossy finger crack splitting it.  P4 5.9 (soft) 150': Follow the finger crack over the steep bit onto a yellow slab. Continue straight up to a small ledge and set a belay.  P5 5.7 180': Move up and left to a right trending crack / ramp. Follow this over a bulge and continue past its end to the summit. Hip belay or small gear just below summit for an anchor.  Drop down the back side of the spire and climb up a left facing corner crack to the next spire top. Another dip down and back up gets you to the last spiry bit. Most folks should feel comfortable unroping here. Contour back to Brownstone and follow its descent.","{111214144: 2, 106014187: 1}"

Armatron,105809181,Trad,105732057,5.9-,680,6,3.5,458.0,"Armatron is excellent. Pitch three will become a red rocks super-classic when the word gets out. The others are merely fun climbing on good rock.  P1: Mosey up and left past 5 bolts before traversing left on plates to a belay station in the scoop visible from the ground (below a crack). ~95', 5.8ish.  P2: Climb the finger crack up and step right to the second crack when convenient (25 or 30'). Go up this crack until the angle slacks off into a sandy slab to the bottom of a large left-facing corner. Do not go up the corner. Step out onto the featured face on the right, where you'll find a bolt after a couple yards. Keep heading up to another station in an unvarnished patch at the base of the beautiful chocolate pitch. ~165', 5.9.  P3: The money pitch. Step right, then head straight up on varnished plates forever. Load up the cracks with nuts and enjoy a rope length of perfect rock. ~160', sustained 5.6.  P4: Trend left off the belay, then follow the varnish up until stepping right on a ledge to another station. ~95', 5.6.  P5: Climb the arete above the ledge, passing three bolts along the way. You'll come to to a very large ledge, the Humorous Ledge. ~80', 5.7  P6: Mantle the large block by going directly up the face for a fun V1-ish boulder problem or just scramble up the side. Continue up the arete passing another two bolts to an anchor. ~100', 5.6  From here, scramble west towards a gully marked with some cairns. Be careful as it is somewhat exposed and there are few places where you definitely do not want to fall. Scramble up the gully and to the top of Juniper Peak.  Descent: There is a very quick walk-off from Juniper Peak. First, ensure you are standing on the summit proper of Juniper Peak (marked with cairns and an ammo can cache). Face Vegas and then walk to your left. There will be a trail marked with cairns. Follow the trail back down to the base. Do not try descending before reaching the true summit as there is a very well marked trail descending S/SW into Pine Creek that will not take you to the base of Armatron.  The route name comes from a robotic toy popular in the 80's (here's a picture of it from Honeybee's blog.). They were a lot of fun.

Black Dagger,105732395,Trad,105732057,5.8,800,6,3.3,127.0,"This route is on the far left side of the Brownstone Wall and the approach takes about 2 hours.  The route is in the sun most of the day so can be quite warm, although the 3rd and 4th pitch are in a recessed chimney and are shady except in the early morning.    We had some difficulty locating the start of this route.  If you head up slabs which lead to the center of the Brownstone Wall, you will have to traverse left quite a ways to get to the route, even going down a bit.  You are nearly back to the creek bed when you reach the base.  The white overhang in Swain's topo on pitch 1 was not obvious to us.  The best way to find the route is to locate the the overhang on the second pitch and the crack system above it.    P1: Climb a crack us through some soft rock to a block that is below a white roof (5.6, 120').  P2: Traverse left, then up to a crack at the far left side of the roof.  Sock in some good gear (on long slings), then head up and back right on varnished plates to the crack which forms the right side of the roof (now below you).  Continue up this crack to a belay ledge (5.7+, 140').  Swain calls this pitch PG but the runouts did did not seem bad to me.  There is a runout above the roof but it is not as bad as that on the next pitch.    P3: Here is where you look up and say ""Oh yeah, Swain did say to bring 'large gear' for this pitch ..."".  Above you is a fantastic black corner, but the back necks down into a fairly fat crack.  I don't exactly recall the width of the crack, I just recall we didn't have anything big enough to fit in it (I'd guess it's 5-6 inches).  You need a #5 Camalot or #3 Big Bro, and the crack might be too flared to fit the Big Bro (I don't think a #4 Camalot fits either).  Stem and face climb up the corner, with or without pro, until you reach the base of a chimney (5.7, 130').  If you don't have any 5-6 inch gear, you will have to run it out at least 20', this is the S section.  If you take big gear you may be able to walk it up and remove the S rating, please add comments below on this.    P4: Wander up into the darkness of a deep slot, exit left through a wild hole onto a huge ledge which faces south and (if it is late enough) into full sunshine (5.2, 100').  Two more pitches go more or less straight up from here, on softer rock.  Great views of the Rainbow Wall to your south.    Descent: Head south into the Gunsight Gully and scramble back down to the start of the route.

I don't think it's quite as good as its neighbor, Immaculate Conception, but it is definitely worth doing if you're in the area.  Approach via either the first three pitches of Pro Choice (recommended) or Senior Dimensions (not recommended) and set up your base camp on the Party Ledge. Continue up the 4th pitch of Senior Dimensions (the short left-facing corner) to a bolted anchor at a small stance. Consider bringing a pair of quicklinks and rings to improve this anchor.  Climb up a crack above the belay. Thin climbing past two bolts leads up and slightly left to gain a leaning, right facing flake. The gear in this flake is a bit tricky and placing it feels a bit touch and go, but it is confidence inspiring when you get it - just be patient and hold on! The climbing through this entire section will keep you on your toes until you finally reach huge holds where the difficulties abruptly relent. Continue up easier face climbing (passing a few portable holds near the top) that ultimately lands you at a bolted anchor shared with Pro Life on a ledge out left.  Descending back to the belay from here is no problem, but if you want to return all the way to the Party Ledge make sure you have either an 80m rope or two ropes.",{10168: 2}

From below, this thing is intimidating, but as you climb, the secrets reveal themselves and it all comes together. So good!  Approach via either the first three pitches of Pro Choice (recommended) or Senior Dimensions (not recommended) and set up your base camp on the Party Ledge. Climb the first bit of P4 of Senior Dimensions (the short left-facing corner), but stay in the corner at first and then continue up a steep, left-leaning crack. This will bring you to jugs below the blunt upper arete. Thin moves up the arete give way to easier face climbing (and a few portable holds near the top). Ultimately, you’ll reach a bolted anchor shared with Pro Life on a ledge out left.  Descend with an 80m rope (watch the ends) or two ropes.

I admit that i used the bush for first left foot hold as i established myself in the crack off finger locks and good right feet.    the crack is strenuous and slightly steep on finger jams for 20'(10.a, purple camalots), then becomes very fun, imaginative and at times improbable 5.9 climbing until the corner ends(maybe 100'), casual 5.8 or easier crack climbing to the belay (final 70-90').    i've eyeballed this sexy swerving crack several times and Jasmine and I went to do High Anxiety and I was bored by the single pitch of real climbing so we added this pitch today thinking it would be 5.7 or 5.8 and what a gem! rock quality was stellar on chocolaty jams with great gear the whole way.

We scrambled up the initial ramp of Nightcrawler to a ledge about 30 or 40 feet off the ground where we dropped our packs and set up to start climbing.  P1:  Leave the ledge and continue up the left leaning ramp that marks the beginning of Nightcrawler.  Climb up the ramp for about 40 or 50 feet until you see a bolt about 8-10 feet out to the right.  Face climbing past another bolt leads to a thin crack system with tricky gear.  Another bolt appears with some face climbing eventually leading to an anchor at a foot rail.  (160ft)  P2:   Climb up the beautifully varnished face to a bolt.  It is a bit committing to get to this first bolt, and is a couple of body lengths off the belay on some slightly fragile holds.  From here the next bolt is even more committing to get to, but now you are on some of the best varnished rock on the route.  Thin face climbing eventually leads to a thin crack with creative gear placements. This crack peters out at a ledge where the climb steps left a few feet.  Leave the ledge and climb up the unprotected face to an anchor that is hidden away in the back of a corner.  I had to get a party on Nightcrawler to held me figure out where I was heading because this anchor is difficult to see.  (160ft)  P3:  The outrageously beautiful corner! While this pitch is short compared to the climbing that precedes it, It makes up for it in quality.  Jam, layback and stem your way up the 60ft to an anchor that hides out on the face to the right of the corner.  This anchor can be seen from the belay below.  (80ft)  From the top of pitch 3 the climb can be linked into Hourglass Diversion for that route's final 2 pitches.  If choosing this option refer to H.D.'s descent information.  Otherwise rappel from here, one rope will get you down the 3rd pitch and then double rope rappel to the ground.  The guidebook mentions a 70m would work for rappelling, but I am not convinced of that.  These pitches seemed much longer than suggested there.","{105796642: 3, 106854768: 3, 107982379: 2, 107732625: 2, 10168: 2}"

P3,4 offer some incredible stemming, laybacking, and jamming on perfect varnished rock. P2 has great climbing as well- varied.     P1: Start below the right side of the Hourglass on a left-trending low-angled crack. End on a ledge at the base of a right-facing corner with a two bolt anchor. 5.6, 150 ft. The length of this pitch will vary depending on how high you are willing to climb unroped.    P2: Step left into the right-facing crack that widens quickly to a chimney. After the chimney ends, make face moves up to the right-leaning, right-facing crack above. This pitch ends at another pretty good ledge with a two bolt anchor. This pitch protects well without large gear. 5.9, 120 ft.    P3: Stunning. Leave the belay with a right facing dihedral fist crack on your left and a perfect finger crack on the right wall. Ascend the corner using both these features until the crack on the right tapers out. Continue up the thin right-facing corner to a ledge with two bolts. This is incredible climbing in a mostly tips corner with occasional face holds. This pitch has many bolts of various ages and variety. Small wires and tcu's are necessary to supplement the bolts. 5.10b, 110 ft.     4. The excellence continues. Keep climbing up the right-facing corner and wonder why there aren't more routes like this. End on a ledge with a two-bolt anchor. 5.10b, 80 ft.     5. Resist the temptation to rap. Climb up a splitter crack of varying sizes on black rock. Overcome the roof, then trend right and up a polished groove to a two-bolt anchor. 80 ft, 5.8R?.     Notes: P3,4 combine easily with a 70, and it would appear the same with a 60m as well. If you do this with a standard rack, be ready to skip bolts and make things a bit sporty. P5 is apparently runout, but didn't seem to protect all that poorly. Above P5 is loose, sandy, difficult to protect and not so great. Enjoy.     Descent: The best option is to rap from the top of P5. The P5 anchors are 1/4"" equalized with cord. Then rap from the top of P4 to the top of P2. Continue the route as described above. 2 60 m cords are required to rap. If not for the P3 anchors, it would be easy to rap with a single 70m from the top of P5 (with a small amount of easy downclimb on P1). P3 anchors are not rap equipped. Of course, the other option is the Gunsight Notch. This involves some unpleasant 5th class climbing past the P5 anchors.

P2:  Climb up right from the belay stance to the top of the block and step straight up steep face  for maybe 8 feet, then hard right around corner to gain a crack system.  Follow crack until it ends.  Up and traverse slightly right towards another crack.  After around 135 feet, start looking for a decent belay spot which may be semi hanging but will have adequate gear.  ~5.5/5.6 PG to possibly R rated.    P3:  Climb up short face and traverse slightly right to crack.  Finish on steep jugs through easy overhang to nice, rose colored small belay ledge.  Medium to hand sized crack here for belay anchor.  75 feet, 5.5.    P4:  Pretty much the crux pitch of the route.  Take care climbing up the short, steep chimney off the P3 belay stance, then follow the short lower angle crack up which disappears into a lower angle face (with scarce protection, maybe slings on horns and small cams in shallow pods.  Look around and don't pass up pro options!).  Climb up, aiming for the twin cracks above, angling to the right (which looks to be the easiest option).  Finally, some good gear options are available (medium to hand sized cams and large nut).  Pull steep, short overhang and gain the nice wide ledge, with wide crack on the left side for belay (#3 and 4 Camalot).  150 feet, 5.6+/5.7 R.    P5:  Follow wide crack up to a neat varnished face and corner crack.  Stay in corner crack up slick lower angle wall (easier than it looks) to belay atop the small pillar (also the end of the chimney tunnel on Black Dagger).  80 feet, 5.5.    P6 and 7:  follow last pitches of Black Dagger.    We climbed up the climbers left prow out of the stance (R rated, no pro for 20 feet) to a nice crack system for 100+ feet leading to a ledge with a tree on the left side.  Then finish up either through roof with wide looking crack on the left side, or, right to steep face to low angle face (medium to big cams in horizontals).  140 feet-ish and 5.5/5.6.

Jerry Handren suggests in his guidebook approaching these final pitches by way of Pro Choice, and I agree.

The FA is unlisted in Handren's book. The route is south-facing; however, note that it goes into the shade in the afternoon in the winter.  ROUTE P1 (5.8, 100') Climb the first pitch of Armatron, which takes up and left past 6 bolts over a brief section of soft white sandstone and onto the dark varnished plates from which Brownstone Wall gets its name. Fixed anchor.  P2 (5.9, 125') Climb the second pitch of Armatron, starting off with an excellent 30' thin crack on solid varnish. As the angle steepens go right to a huge horn and pull the bolt-protected crux by mantling onto the horn. Traverse right to another thin crack, aiming for the base of a left-facing corner with a fixed belay.  P3 (5.6, 80') Head up an easy corner to chimney. Pull a roof on big jugs and step left to a ledge with a fixed anchor. Pitches 3 and 4 can be linked with significant rope drag per Dow, an option which I avoided.  P4 (5.7, 95') Traverse left to a fixed belay below a tree and the bolted flake for which the climb was named.  P5 (5.9, 110') Make your way onto the thin, balancey flake. The flake is flexy and gear placements are not very useful for most of the way. Fortunately, the flake is well protected with bolts. At the top of the flake move right and mantle onto a small ledge, then make a horizontal traverse to a bush. From there a fine hand crack leads to the anchor.

It seems that the red book left out a pitch in the description, so I'll just describe the route as the anchors are setup. See the notes below regarding linkups, etc.    P1: Start on a face and crack that leads up to the left side of the Hourglass. Parts of this pitch are in a shallow left-facing corner; others are on a looser face with cracks. The pitch ends at a 2-bolt anchor. 100 ft, 5.9.

The bolt frequency really starts to pick up here. Follow the crack from chimney to fists, where it suddenly tapers to tips (purple tcu). Utilize face holds to stem up the corner, eventually stepping right to a stance on the arete with a few bolts. 50 ft, 5.10+.    P4: The business. Step back left into a chimney. Wiggle a short distance to its end and move into a layback to overcome a chockstone. Continue up the wide crack as it leans and widens to a bomb bay chimney. Move out left with the chimney to a roof with a perfect dihedral above it. Exiting the roof may remind you of southeast roof climbing, but without the spiders and bugs. The dihedral above the roof is the crux and is desperately thin in places. Thankfully, between all the old bolts and a few spots that widen up, pro is good. You'll find a 2-bolt anchor 25 ft over the roof in a cramped corner with a small roof overhead. This is a horrible belay- see suggestions below for how to avoid it. 110 ft, 5.11+.    P5: As good as the previous 2 pitches were, this one is at the other end of the spectrum. Stem up out of the horrible hanging belay, praying a hold doesn't break and you land on your belayer. Pass several bolts and disgusting rotten rock, eventually reaching better rock. An offwidth roof formed by a left-facing flake should be looming over you at this point. Climb up to the roof, then move right a few steps, following the old bolts out onto an easy face. Follow this to the top of the pillar and a great ledge. Alternatively, you could always go left out the roof and follow the flake/dihedral to the ledge. Either way, this pitch is anything but spectacular and is a major disappointment after the 2 prior pitches. 160 ft, 5.10-.    P6: Climb P5 of Nightcrawler- splitter crack to a roof, then up right over a roof to an anchor. 80 ft, 5.8R.    Notes: P1,2 are easy linkups if you start the route from a high ledge. A 60m cord reaches just barely. One of the lower pitches seems to be left-out in the red book. Hopefully, you won't be confused by the discrepancy between this description and the guide. There are many, many bolts on the crux pitches. Expect to need to clip some unless you're a stud on the rp action. To avoid the horrible belay stance on top of P4, climb past the 2 bolt anchor. Stop about 25 ft into pitch 5 at a stance on black rock with a bolt a few feet above. Save a piece or two in the 1/2""-1"" range to back up the bolt.

Cloud Tower,105732386,Trad,105732005,5.12a,810,6,3.9,317.0,"One of the best long free climbs of its grade in the country.  On a par with The Naked Edge, the Prow, and Astroman.  This route should not be missed.  If you climb at this level, you will not have lead a full life without experiencing The Cloud Tower!      Approach: Same as Crimson Chrysalis.  Average approach time about an hour, unless you're an old geezer like me.  Cloud Tower begins about 100-130 feet right and downhill of CC, at an obvious chimney that leads to a left facing dihedral.  N.B. some pitches are described differently than as suggested by the guides.  Aspect: North facing until the last pitch which faces west and soaks up the afternoon sun. The initial pitches can be chilly.    P1.  Climb the squeeze chimney and up the hand crack in the left facing corner (5.8).  Rather than stopping at the ledge (135'), we kept climbing up the corner above for another 100 feet or so (5.8) and stopped on the next obvious ledge. (5.8, 225')    P2. Traverse up and way left, past a tree, to the base of a beautiful splitter handcrack, climb it (5.10) and then trend up and left to the base of an awesome right facing, right angling corner. Another rope stretcher. (5.10, 210+')    P3. IMO, the crux pitch. Face climb discontinuous cracks up and left past a bolt into the corner, ascend the corner with Eldorado-like face climbing and stemming and then tips laybacking for what seems like an eternity. (5.12-, 115'; Rack: 1.5F, nuts, blue/black aliens, green aliens, 1F, 1.5-2.5F)    P4. A long ""easy"" pitch (120', 5.10) that will be exciting if your rack is short on larger sizes or if your wide flaring crack technique is wanting. (Rack: I am embarrassed to confess having 3 each of 2.5-3.5 F, 2 4Fs and a 4 Camalot and using them all.)      P5.  The Harding Slot of Red Rocks.  The guide describes climbing a scary offwidth to the top of the tower at 5.10+.  We climbed a short wide section (5.7) and then tunneled through the tower.  The crux was squeezing through a taper for about 3 feet onto the west face.  Not recommended for the bulbous or the claustrophobic.  Some friends have climbed to the top of the tower as the guide suggests, while others traversed the tower (climbed right from the belay around the tower).  No one has expressed great joy at the thought of repeating any of these options.  (5.?, 45-50')    P6.  After emerging from the birth canal, you are suddenly transplanted onto the west face of the tower at the base of a stellar Indian Creekish hand crack. Climb the flaring hand crack through several awkward bulges (5.11), while shedding as much clothing as you can remove.  Potential radical temperature difference after the north face experience.  Save a 1 camalot and some energy for the final hard moves to the belay.

The route is at the mouth of Juniper Canyon. The access is the same for Olive Oil, but Crimson is located on the Cloud Tower, which can be identified by a pinkish tower capped by a red top. The Cloud Tower is located on the north facing side of Juniper Canyon. As you approach the mouth of Juniper you'll see a bushy ramp that angles up and right (west) to the base of the route. Follow the climber trail up the ramp to the route's beginning.     P1 - Straight up the crack / right corner to a bolt belay 5.7 (130 ft).     P2 - Pitch 2 continues to climb the same crack / corner until you reach a recess with another 2 bolt belay. 5.8 four bolts (90 ft).    P3 - You can link pitches 2 and 3 with a 60 meter rope. Nice jams on this pitch. Continue up past a steep section to a 2 bolt hanging belay. 5.8+ (65 ft).    P4 - Enjoy the chimney above and continue on into the small cracks to a nice ledge to belay. 5.8 (90 ft).    P5 - Continue up the small-to-hand cracks past a bolt for 90 feet to another small ledge 5.8+ (90 ft).    P6 - Up another 90 feet angling right following 5 bolts. 5.6 (90 ft).    P7- A nice long face pitch clipping 9 bolts that will end in the red rock. 5.6 (110 ft).    P8 - Continue up the RR to a ramp with a bolt. Then traverse directly to your right, remember your follower, and then up the left ramp. Finish the pitch up the varnished face clipping 3 bolts. 5.7 (75 ft).    P9 - Up and right clipping 4 bolts over a small roof to the top. 5.8 (80 ft).

Most of the bolts on this route look like they are strait out of the 70's, but they are in good shape and could take a good fall.    Pitch 1 starts about 25 Ft left of Crimson.  The first pitch is solid 5.8 and a ton of fun.  Go strait up through discontinuous cracks past 2 bolts.  There are several opportunities for trad gear.  Mostly nuts, but small cams are a possibility. 2 bolt anchor at the top of the pitch.    Pitch 2 starts out with several good cam placements in a dihedral.  One #4 can be placed in the widest section of the dihedral. (wish I had one when I did it!)  The pitch then increases in difficulty and moves up and left over a bulge and onto the face.  The holds are very good, but there is no opportunity for gear placements until the anchors about 20 Ft away. Pitch 2 finishes with a 2 bolt anchor. 5.9-    Pitch 3 is a little confusing when you are at the start. There are 2 bolts strait above and one bolt way up to the right.  It looks like the route could be climbed by going strait up, but it would definitely bump up the grade on the climb.  The route is meant to go up and to the right over a small ledge.  We clipped the first bolt strait overhead and then traversed right about 15 Ft, clipped another bolt, then worked over the ledge.  This was the crux of the climb.  By clipping the first bolt overhead, it added a lot of head-game and safety benefit, but caused SERIOUS rope drag at the top of the pitch.  After pulling over the bulge and on the small ledge, move up and left to 2 more bolts.  Both are pretty runout in between.  After this, move strait up, through another seriously runout section, to a 2 bolt anchor.  However, do NOT set up your anchor here.  This is a hanging belay, but if you go up another 15 Ft, there is ANOTHER 2 bolt anchor on a fantastic ledge.  Power through and get to this ledge. A few small cam and nut placements are possible on this pitch and can help make the runouts better. 10.a/b      Pitch 4 goes strait up through another runout section. Some flakes look they would take gear, but are really loose and wouldn't support a fall.  After 15-20 Ft, work up and right to a bolt.  Move straight right to meet up with the 6th pitch of Crimson Crystalis.  The final 25ft of this pitch are on Crimson and has 2 bolts, plus multiple gear opportunities.    Rappel down Crimson Crystalis.  Careful of getting your rope stuck!    Overall, the route was a ton of fun.  If you are a solid 5.10 climber, you will have no problems with the moves on this route.  The runouts are big, but the moves are solid.  Since its not climbed nearly as much as Crimson, some of the holds are loose and shouldn't be used.  If someone lives in the area, and feels like having another project, this route could be vastly improved by adding a few more bolts in the runout sections that can't take gear.",{106090256: 2}

It is a proud and challenging line, but the challenges often go beyond clean technical difficulties.  If you're looking for a serious mountain outing, this could be a real contender!    Start out climbing the first continuous crack system to the left of Test Tube to a large, brushy ledge area on the right.  (Or alternatively, climb Test Tube or Spare Rib to the same area.)  Climb the gully above, fourth class at first.  Higher, the gully is split by a protruding buttress; face-climb the buttress, with limited protection, to another large brushy ledge.  At the right (western) end of the ledge there is a clean corner behind a pine tree.  Go up the corner to a belay by a bush.  Jog right for a few feet, then climb back left into a left-leaning cleft.  Follow the path of least resistance (with some hard climbing) until reaching the flat top of a flake/pinnacle feature in the red rock.  Cross left to the opposite end of the ledge and make a face move to reach a clean offwidth crack (probably best to belay at the base of this crack).  Climb the crack and continue generally straight up for a few hundred feet until reaching an apparent impasse in a small cave.  Exit to the left on very soft rock.  The difficulties soon ease and the summit ridge is reached.    The FA party continued up to the eastern summit of Rainbow Mountain, then worked west to the normal Oak Creek descent route.  This took us almost six hours, and we generally knew the way.    Further info on this route can be found at  this site. ",{12463: 2}

Upon first looking at it, it is not immediately obvious that a good route is here. The first pitch is obvious, but the broken face above it doesnt immediately reveal itself to be passable. Yet, about 200' above this face is an appealing looking chimney. Our thanks to George and Joanne for braving unknown terrain for this fine route.    The Pachyderm lies near the base of the ramp, on the second buttress on your left. Look for a dark, varnished chimney that leads to a prominent scoop about half a rope length up the wall.    Pitch 1: Climb the chimney to the scoop and belay. 5.8, 120'    Pitch 2: Some choices present themselves. The original route stepped slightly left off belay and headed up, following old bolts to a bolted stance about 100' above. However, there seems to be another option by stepping right off the belay ledge and heading up that way. This way may be at least worth a look- as there are new bolts up near the belay on this side, and there may be one or two more closer to belay. Either way, head up for about 100' until you see a bolted belay (new bolts). 5.9, 100'    Pitch 3: From this belay, traverse right to the chimney and follow it up to a nice ledge. 150', 5.7    Pitch 4: Head up the chimney to the summit, 190', 5.7 (There is an optional belay about 50' below the summit if rope drag is an issue.)    Descent:This descent is tricky and dangerous and extreme care needs to be used! Drop into the gully on the west side of the formation. Although you need two ropes to descend, the first three rappels can and should be made with a single line. Upon arrival at the fourth rap, use the second line to make one long rappel to the floor.

Thagomizer,106194021,Trad,105732005,5.10,500,4,3.0,2.0,"Pitch 1: climb straight up the corner, passing a difficult section at an obvious bulge.  Pitch 2: continue up the crack system to a good ledge beneath a prominent chimney.  Pitch 3: climb the chimney to an overhang at its top, then belay on a ledge about 20 feet higher.    At this point the crack system has diverged from the main corner and reached an impasse beneath an unprotectable varnished headwall. The fourth pitch begins with a traverse right and up to gain the main corner at the lip of a giant overhang.  A committing move leads to a position of momentary security in the corner above.  Difficult climbing continues for another 40 feet until the angle begins to relent.  Easier climbing then leads to a large ledge on the very crest of the buttress.    Although we explored another pitch up the main crack system on the upper buttress, the climbing was loose, dirty, unpleasant, and not recommended. Especially because you are already standing on the walk-off descent ledge.  Descent: There may be better ways to do this. . .  We walked west on the ledge system until reaching the first drainage.  We walked down and right (east) to a rappel from a large pine tree on the right edge of the drainage.  Two double-rope rappels led to the canyon floor.    A few other descent notes.  Although our rappel route was workable, it did not achieve the status of ""pleasant"" or ""relaxed,"" and I would readily consider other options.  Going straight down the drainage did not look like a good bet.  It turns into a dank chimney littered with shredded rope cores signifying an ancient epic.  Somewhere in this area I have heard of a hiking/mountaineering route that leads over west into the bowl beneath the Rainbow Wall.  I have not done this, and do not know precisely where it goes.  However, it seems like it might be a good way down if it could be easily reached. (And as we entered the descent drainage, we saw a few ducks, so it is possible we were right there. It may be necessary to go a little uphill to reach the bowl, and we were in a downhill frame of mind.)  Historical notes: This is a prominent line, and I am sure many have wondered why no route has been recorded here.  In fact,the first three pitches have likely been done numerous times dating back to the 1970s.  We encountered a lot of old bail gear.  The top of the third pitch is kind of a dead end.  The continuation of the crack system becomes an unprotectable RURP seam.  It is climbable (we top-roped it), but it is hard enough that the sometimes crispy rock, and the lack of protection become serious factors.  The corner on the right looks outrageous, but ultimately tiptoes slightly inside the boundary of the insane.    The route is excellent, and despite earlier activity, has remained nameless. One common element in the naming of climbing routes is reference to the scorpion as symbol of ""the sting is in the tail.""  Surely, this concept applied to this route with its spectacular top-pitch crux.  But we wanted something better...  The word ""thagomizer"" refers to the bony tail spikes of the stegosaurus.  The word has been recently adopted by paleontologists, inspired by a Far Side cartoon from 1982.  The cartoon shows a caveman giving a lecture to a bunch of other cavemen.  With his pointer he is indicating the tail section of a diagram of a stegosaurus, and he is saying to his assembled listeners, ""Now this end is called the thagomizer, after the late Thag Simmons.""  Scientists adopted the term into their formal lexicon.  An image of the cartoon, and full explanation can be found here:   en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thago…","{12463: 3, 105789175: 3}"

P2: Three bolts of fingery climbing lead up an odd series of sidepulls and liebacks.  Certainly the crux for me but you crack-deprived Red Rocks locals might find this section relatively easy.  Footwork is key, but once you move right to the crack itself there is a rest.  Continue up the crack which is steep and leaning all the wrong ways.  Size changes and several cruxes ensure a solid pump.  Up higher you may be glad to have brought a #5 or #6 Camalot to protect a difficult move out of a wide section, but even after this very overhanging hand jams will keep you fighting right to the end.

Blade Runner (aka The Ginger Arête),111287898,Trad,105732018,5.10b,350,3,3.4,41.0,"High on the east face of Rainbow Mountain and just above Ginger Cracks is a striking, 350' knife-edge arête. Blade Runner - AKA The Ginger Arête - climbs this feature in three wild pitches. The line, which is easily visible from the highway (and unmistakable when illuminated by the morning sun), is both really fun climbing and, for those capable of climbing the grade, destined to become the natural finish to Ginger Cracks. Keep in mind, however, that this route is demanding: Though the hard moves are all well-protected, you don't get pro every body length. Also, as is the case with many routes in Red Rocks that haven't received much traffic, Blade Runner has quite a few fragile holds and thin, hollow flakes. The route will undoubtedly clean up with time, but the climbing will ""feel"" harder because the rock demands a light touch.  Approach: Climb Ginger Cracks through pitch 5 to the beginning of the 4th class 6th pitch. Rather than scramble up to the start of the final corner, look right: Careful study of the arête will reveal a lone bolt about 25' up. Begin here.  P1 (110', 5.8): Climb up incut but fragile holds on the face just left of the arête passing a few optional gear placements en-route to the first bolt. Avoid a huge, overhanging block directly on the arête by moving back left to gain a short hand crack splitting a large patch of black varnish. Continue briefly up this before returning again to the arête and a second bolt. Four more bolts lead directly up the exposed edge to an awesome belay platform. A total of 6 bolts and some hand-sized cams protect.  P2 (130', 5.10b): Climb directly up the arête passing 9 bolts for protection. Belay on a great ledge formed by an oven-sized block (careful). This pitch is amazing.  P3 (110', 5.9): Continue up the arête, climbing on both sides, passing 5 bolts before gaining a low angle hand crack. Follow this to a sixth bolt and a final traverse left on an obvious ledge to a bolted anchor. Again, 6 bolts and some hand-sized cams protect.  To descend, rappel straight down from the anchor with one 60m rope to a dedicated rappel anchor (do not skip this anchor on rappel or your rope will get stuck). A second single-rope rap leads to the notch between the main wall and the standard top out of Ginger Cracks. From here a third single-rope rap off a slung chockstone leads down into the bowl above Power Failure.","{107394785: 4, 111284682: 4, 108720484: 4, 107363518: 4, 105871367: 4, 200405750: 4, 200292527: 4, 108023481: 4, 112107400: 4, 7117535: 4, 111733522: 4, 200236802: 4, 200064567: 4, 111252595: 4, 105996592: 4, 108773417: 4, 108074697: 4, 14442: 4, 10168: 4, 107844366: 4, 10364: 4, 110457315: 4, 111278312: 4, 107102882: 3, 105862361: 3, 109495618: 3, 200101052: 3, 110520425: 3, 106422719: 3, 112043516: 3, 107650213: 3, 200066217: 3, 105826344: 3, 105871395: 3, 111821616: 3, 106323170: 3, 106774743: 2, 12486: 2, 106838734: 2, 200408040: 2, 106697740: 2}"

The 10c pitch was also great but the 6 inch piece was not needed in hindsight.

The only thing it lacks, from my knowledge, is a good anchor. It is definitely worth throwing a couple extra cams in the pack if you're going to be in the area.     From the right side of the ledge, climb a cool, lower angle thin hands crack past a bush (or the chimney to the left). Once at the dead vertical (perhaps slightly overhanging) headwall, some broken up handcracks lead to the base of the main course where a #3 will fit. For some it'll turn out to be pretty solid fists. For others, something a little more awkward! The crack and face are spectacularly clean.

Ginger Cracks,105732260,Trad,105732018,5.9,900,7,3.2,361.0,"I enjoyed this route as much as Crimson Chrysalis - it is more crack oriented, less crowded, but has some less than stellar rock on a few pitches. In the past year or so, bolted belays were added which changed the character of the route a bit. Now it is possible to do the best pitches and rap off. Personally I think the addition of bolted belays is a good thing, otherwise some of the belay locations would be awkward. The crux pitch now has an extra bolt (see description). I do not know the origin of these new bolts.  The start of the route may be identified by a 6-12"" crack that goes up to a scrubby tree. This crack is clean but the start looks like a grunt, so we climbed a thin crack to the left and stepped right, which seemed harder than the 5.7 rating of this pitch. Continue up past the tree, and climb double cracks (see Swain's topo) up a slot to a bolted belay at the top of a flake/pedestal (5.7, 130').  P2: Move down and step right, then head straight up cracks, through a short chimney, and follow more cracks to another bolted belay (5.8, 150'). I thought this was the best pitch on the route.  P3: Head up to a right facing corner and crank past a small overhang. Crank over and then follow a wide crack and less than stellar rock to the next belay (no offwidthing necessary) (5.8, [90' according to comment below]).  P4: The crux pitch. Move up and then right to a new bolt. Continue up to an ancient 1/4"" bolt. There is a new bolt maybe 3' higher than the rusty bolt. I don't know why they didn't just replace the 1/4"" bolt. The rock on this pitch is a little suspect, but the crux section is not too long and is now quite well protected. Continue on up to another bolted belay. This is the last bolted belay on the route, so if you want to go down, do so now. (5.9, 140').  P5: This pitch has a reputation for bad rock, and indeed be extra careful as a hold could easily snap off. However bad rock in Red Rocks is still pretty good. Follow a steep crack through nice (too nice) horizontal dikes to a huge ledge. Throw in protection often in case a hold snaps off, this pitch has recorded some spectacular falls, but it is really not that bad, just be careful (5.8, 150').  P6: Scramble easily past bushes to a large chimney, climb the corner to the left and belay on a large ledge at the base of a left facing corner (5.2, 160').  P7: Climb the left facing corner, then move right to a weird dihedral above a bottomless chimney. This next section is hard to protect due to the zig-zag nature of the pitch.

Pitch 3: (160' 5.9) left and up black face to the left of the left facing dihederal. This route is another Urioste classic, enjoy  Descent: From the top bolted anchor - which is at the base of a dirty and vegetated bowl, there are two ways to descend using double ropes. 1) Make two double-rope raps with 60m ropes by dropping virtually straight down (i.e., to climber's left of Power Failure); this way uses an intermediate rap anchor with a tiny ledge; be mindful of your rope ends as the first rap is about 50 to 55 meters. Or 2) make three double-rope raps back down Power Failure (i.e., trend climber's right) from the top bolted anchor.  You can descend with a single 70m rope by rappelling down “All You Can Eat” to the right of the route.  From the top, scramble easy terrain up and right to the end of the bowl.  4 rappels will bring you back to the base.  BE CAREFUL!! Be aware and cautious of teams descending the basin above. The horseshoe bowl above the route is a feeding chute for all things loose. Typically teams descending Ginger Cracks rap into that basin and scramble down to the first rap (last anchor) of Power Failure.

Spice,117996421,Trad,105732018,5.10c,325,3,2.5,4.0,"Spice is a line of unknown origin that was rediscovered, documented, and given a name by Larry DeAngelo in the early 2000’s (see comment below). Recently it has been extended by another pitch to a logical conclusion higher on the wall. This final pitch, dubbed “The Pepperberry” is a great pitch of climbing that really adds to the route, both in terms of quality and difficulty. More traffic would really clean this route up - a great outing would be to do both this and its neighbor, Sugar, which is of similar difficulty and offers even better climbing. From the top of The Pepperberry finish, one can easily connect with the 4th pitch of Ginger Cracks if you want to continue with that route. Alternatively, one can rappel with a single 60m rope.  P1 (5.7, 60’): Climb a gully of sorts that is about 30’ right of the start of Ginger Cracks. This gully turns into a corner with broken cracks and leads to a good belay ledge at a tree. A short pitch.  P2 (5.9, 175’): Climb a long corner system that eventually thins to a seam with a good edge. The gear is a bit tricky in spots but overall this is a good, long pitch that leads to a bolted belay at a foothold. This pitch can be broken up into two shorter pitches by traversing right to the P2 belay on Sugar at a bolt. Note that an old Star Drive bolt high on this pitch has been removed due to its proximity to bombproof gear placements.  P3 (5.10c, 90’): The Pepperberry. Some nice climbing. Head up a seam above the belay then work left to a second seam (bolt) which is followed (crux) to a left-facing corner. At a roof where the corner changes to become right-facing, step right (mind your rope drag) out of the corner to a bolt, and work up and right to easier climbing up a thin crack to an anchor.  Descent: Rap the last pitch then continue down Sugar from there. Alternatively, climb up and left to join the 4th pitch of Ginger Cracks.","{10168: 3, 107102882: 3, 106838734: 3, 200405750: 1}"

Recently it has been extended another pitch to a logical conclusion higher on the wall. This final pitch, dubbed “The Sugar Glider” is a sublime pitch of Red Rocks slab and seam climbing that elevates what was already a really good, but under appreciated, route to what I think is neo-classic status. As a bonus, from the top of The Sugar Glider, one can easily connect with the 4th pitch of Ginger Cracks if you want to continue with that route. Alternatively, rappel with a single 60m rope.  P1 (5.7, 95’): Climb the left side of the lowest buttress that is about 30’ right of the start of Ginger Cracks. Some fragile rock, protected by two bolts, gives way to a finger crack in nice varnish. One more bolt and gear placements lead to an anchor, or link easily into the next pitch.  P2 (5.10a, 80’): Climb a shallow left-facing corner and arete past 5x bolts and opportunities for gear to a bolted anchor on a nice ledge. Note that two bolts were removed from this pitch due to their proximity to bombproof gear placements. A great pitch.  P3 (5.10d PG13, 150’): The Sugar Glider: A classic pitch! Climb the beautiful, narrow panel of rock sandwiched between a seam on the left and the arete to the right. High on the pitch trend left towards a final bolt in an overlap and the shallow right-facing corner just above. Step up and left (do not follow the corner) to easier climbing up a thin crack to an anchor. 9x bolts and gear protect.  Descent: Rap 90’ straight down to an anchor on Spice, then continue down Sugar the rest of the way.

I would give it 6 stars if I could.    There are 2 crux sections but the climbing is fairly consistent the entire way.

Follow the obvious chimney to where it turns into an offwidth at an overhang about twenty feet up.  Squeeze past the bulge.  Limited maneuvering room and restricted visibility make this the crux. Continue up the crack a short distance and belay.  (There is probably enough rope to do the climb in a single pitch, but it is likely you have left your big cam down at the bulge and it will come in handy again up higher.)    Descend via rappel from the bushes at the west end of the ledge.  From the current anchor position, the descent can be done with a single 60-meter rope and some downclimbing, or with two ropes.","{12463: 2, 111284682: 1}"
Buffon's Needle Problem,109952099,Trad,105732054,5.10,1000,7,3.4,18.0,"The problem is geometric; its solution requires many techniques. Three amazing pitches grace this outing. Sew it up    P1 the approach pitch. Step up and spiral right around the front of the buttress to gain a crack system in black rock on the right side of the buttress. Continue to the top of the buttress. Rope drag in the flakes may dictate an intermediate belay. If an oak leaf needle problem is preferred, this pitch can be shortened by thrashing up the gulley of choice. ~50 meters, perhaps 5.7.    P2 Up the corner/crack to the first trash compactor roof/chock-stone. Pass this on the left. Belay in the rubble pile above the chock-stone. The rope is sure to jam in cams placed in the roof; if you can keep the cams clear of the rope, the rope will jam in the roof crack itself. ~30 meters, 5.10ish, #4 camalot useful getting past the roof.    P3 Up the corner/crack to the second trash compactor roof/chock-stone. Pass this on the left.  Near the top of the chock-stone, place gear and step left past the narrow band of black rock. What the heck are those rappel bolts for? If you belay at these bolts, consider the consequences of a leader fall in the cruxy moves off the belay. Move left of the bolts and up the tricky face and changing corners to a final trash compactor roof/chock-stone. Nuts and the thinnest cams are useful; this section protects better than it looks. Pass the chock-stone on the left to a good belay stance. 5.10ish, ~30 meters    P4 Up the tight, gently overhanging tight-hands crack/corner into the eye of the needle. Dimensional trickery permits needle threading. A short pitch, ~20 meters; the belay at the start of this pitch takes the same gear as the tight hand crack, so extra gear in the black metolius #5 (black) to yellow camalot may be in order. Once the needle is threaded, it is possible to escape due right for ~60 meters of 3rd class crossing Myster Z, then 20 meters 3rd class up and right to a down-climb into a gullymore oak trees and down-climbing. Or.    P5-7 Once the needle is threaded, continue up the wide crack/corner (wider than #4 camalot) which narrows, ramps left, and steps right into another crack/corner system. Near the top of this 2nd crack/corner system, step left into the left facing crack corner system that will become the final pitches of Rose Hips. About three 60 meter pitches will gain 3rd & 4th class slabs. Perhaps 5.7 in a spot or two, but mostly 5.4ish.

Chimney Cricket,116368939,Trad,105732054,5.9,630,4,3.0,2.0,"Chimney Cricket climbs the wide cleft to the left of Degunker. Although the chimney is virtually unbroken from bottom to top, a good portion of the climbing is done on the sculpted slab on the left side of the cleft itself. You'll be bouncing in and out of the chimney like a cricket, y'know. Like its neighbours on the south face of Jackrabbit Buttress, this route makes a fine approach to Brownstone Wall.  Pitch 1 (5.9, 120 feet): Climb the thin sandy dihedral leading into a hanging chimney. Soon it opens up and gradually forces you slightly left on steepening parallel cracks. At the sharp contact between yellow and pink stone, traverse 15 feet right into the main left-facing corner (i.e. the only crack that breaks the headwall above).  Pitch 2 (5.8, 160 feet): Grunt up the strenuous offwidth and pull over the roof on glorious buckets. Soon you can exit the chimney and meander up the rippled slab on the left side, placing gear where available. At some point in the pink zebra band, you will be forced back into the chimney. Exit again to the left slab where a single juniper corpse chokes the chimney. Belay on the sloping ledge.  Pitch 3 (5.7, 150 feet): Climb sparse varnished plates up the slab to the left of the chimney. As you get higher, you can choose to either: (1) Continue straight up a thin 5.7 crack, or (2) Move right into a delicious low-angle handcrack that becomes a right-facing corner/arch. Both options funnel into a sweet varnished alcove, a belay shared with Degunker.  Pitch 4 (5.2, 200 feet): Hop over the little shelf and jog up the left-leaning crack until it peters out on the summit slabs. Recommended to simul this pitch as it is very easy and you've gotta get to Armatron quick!  Descent: Walk straight back to Brownstone Wall. If you have time, climb one of those routes. If not, descend the easy slabs into Juniper Canyon and follow the trail back down, passing close to the base of the route.","{111575643: 3, 112536696: 3}"

Pitch 2 continues up the crack system as it turns into a forbidding offwidth.  Stemming holds and a big cam make this pitch more reasonable than it first appears.  After the offwidth turns into a chimney, work out a belay where you can find good anchor potential.    Pitch 3 finishes the crack, then presents a choice.  The easier route is to follow the left branch, which turns into a good ramp.  The right branch leads to an offwidth grovel, then easier climbing.

Geronimo,105732377,Trad,105732054,5.6,0,4,2.8,305.0,"A relatively new, but already quite popular, climb. (Makes you wonder how many other nice unclimbed routes there are further back and higher up in the various canyons....)  Approach as per Crimson Chrysalis, but before reaching the gully which separates the canyon, take a trail up towards the base of the buttress. The trails to the base of the climb aren't as well defined as the main trail, but are certainly easy enough to stay on. Like so many of the approaches in Red Rocks, the difficulty is often deciding which of the various trail branches to follow.  The climb starts at the base of the face, at a prominent crack.  P1: Climb a long pitch up the face (surprisingly steep in places), with generally good pro in the crack. The pitch ends at a huge forested terrace. Belay at or near the boulders.  P2: Negotiate your way to the back of the terrace, and climb a crack just left of the huecoed face. Climb up to an intermediate platform with a huge boulder (possible belay), or (if you have a 60m rope) stretch it out another 50 feet to the next large terrace. Watch for rope drag if you skip the intermediate belay.  P3: Again relocate to the back of the terrace, and begin climbing a crack in the face. This face itself has a second tier, so use long runners to avoid rope drag. Aim for left of a left facing, arching dihedral. You'll go up (and well out of sight of your belayer) beyond the top of that arc, past a couple delicate stemming moves, to a small stance in another dihedral. Be careful of your anchor placements here, because one of the cracks is bisected with a flexing flake.  P4: Go up and slightly left from the belay, then up and right, hugging the exposed arete 50' to the summit of the pinnacle. The gear is a little sparse on this last pitch.  Descent: Do a double rope rappel from the summit to the top of P2, then a series of single rope rappels down the chimney that winds up 50' right of the start of the climb.Avoid the temptation to use your second rope to get down the chimney more quickly, as several sections of the chimney look to be hungry. Please note: Rap anchors have been placed on top of the first and second pitches. The base can now be reached with three double-rope rappels. (If, after the first double-rope rappel, you rap the next pitch with a single rope, you'll not be able to reach the next rap anchor. There's a large rock that can be reached, if you have a 70-meter rope and you don't mind rapping off the end of your rope. You can then down climb to the anchor on top of the first pitch. From there, it you need two-rope to reach the base.)","{106389541: 4, 107313907: 4, 12119: 4, 105865750: 4, 106027947: 4, 106018260: 4, 106782439: 4, 105795302: 4, 106953954: 4, 106158624: 4, 106436292: 4, 107442878: 4, 108023481: 4, 108362942: 4, 106946947: 4, 108885152: 4, 110919861: 4, 107028300: 4, 109167471: 4, 107761738: 4, 106095990: 4, 109881922: 4, 110459813: 4, 110460691: 4, 109006073: 4, 112421798: 4, 113415767: 4, 112426189: 4, 108852723: 4, 112512800: 4, 109767567: 4, 200155559: 4, 111556782: 4, 112383380: 4, 107078738: 4, 112361594: 4, 200463667: 4, 200103049: 4, 111823672: 4, 112521589: 4, 109340087: 4, 105951192: 3, 106386195: 3, 107189619: 3, 106089213: 3, 105806671: 3, 105805486: 3, 105802446: 3, 107099202: 3, 105804842: 3, 105812457: 3, 105853720: 3, 105870586: 3, 105919485: 3, 10481: 3, 106299993: 3, 14595: 3, 13937: 3, 106017451: 3, 106117267: 3, 107312166: 3, 107544688: 3, 106824315: 3, 10769: 3, 106121432: 3, 106088934: 3, 105854232: 3, 107316971: 3, 106913698: 3, 106291813: 3, 105888900: 3, 105846944: 3, 106134676: 3, 105787493: 3, 106522431: 3, 106322173: 3, 106310836: 3, 105825015: 3, 11181: 3, 106553289: 3, 106215446: 3, 106387327: 3, 106313243: 3, 106813158: 3, 106123628: 3, 106655109: 3, 106974389: 3, 107072394: 3, 106683764: 3, 106903881: 3, 107086784: 3, 106979194: 3, 107102879: 3, 107301514: 3, 106710164: 3, 107358081: 3, 107340581: 3, 15093: 3, 106513659: 3, 107808680: 3, 107518458: 3, 105886712: 3, 108430112: 3, 107680316: 3, 107159816: 3, 106795732: 3, 108282189: 3, 108015415: 3, 106958966: 3, 107786859: 3, 109003014: 3, 106794218: 3, 108823422: 3, 108346369: 3, 109554096: 3, 108416200: 3, 109170236: 3, 108624519: 3, 105897956: 3, 11156: 3, 107520718: 3, 108491912: 3, 105939248: 3, 108100421: 3, 105959470: 3, 106407009: 3, 108151053: 3, 108317371: 3, 108301784: 3, 111716666: 3, 110711271: 3, 110751062: 3, 111232456: 3, 108151993: 3, 109394149: 3, 111678016: 3, 111045477: 3, 108363077: 3, 111757042: 3, 107115694: 3, 108088424: 3, 111321805: 3, 107041196: 3, 110777198: 3, 111612526: 3, 10118: 3, 111664966: 3, 108310475: 3, 111938041: 3, 111833640: 3, 109554938: 3, 112385456: 3, 109132699: 3, 105956258: 3, 106102649: 3, 110740325: 3, 200070835: 3, 108977555: 3, 106860947: 3, 110085490: 3, 110875347: 3, 108046160: 3, 106440310: 3, 106838734: 3, 200162817: 3, 106949749: 3, 106514856: 3, 106586290: 3, 105846604: 3, 111919783: 3, 200177119: 3, 200209178: 3, 107806682: 3, 112439044: 3, 106656746: 3, 110919831: 3, 106531787: 3, 107702340: 3, 107640602: 3, 109531604: 3, 200186514: 3, 200298904: 3, 109585594: 3, 106596992: 3, 200049121: 3, 111185402: 3, 105871395: 3, 200371228: 3, 108859151: 3, 105951805: 3, 108479343: 3, 112068096: 3, 112250400: 3, 200367280: 3, 106797746: 3, 106822110: 3, 200064085: 3, 111635077: 3, 200119221: 3, 200129124: 3, 109765597: 3, 110831889: 3, 110239629: 3, 110896657: 3, 111950751: 3, 106558490: 3, 200636141: 3, 105832216: 3, 107663850: 3, 111657384: 3, 200671173: 3, 109187861: 3, 12023: 3, 107761407: 3, 200471978: 3, 112527602: 3, 14330: 3, 200075547: 3, 107548227: 3, 107022803: 3, 14537: 3, 108126588: 3, 10996: 2, 10515: 2, 13155: 2, 14329: 2, 105788098: 2, 105792960: 2, 10168: 2, 11591: 2, 105887867: 2, 107553463: 2, 105829161: 2, 106685212: 2, 15023: 2, 107428873: 2, 106270872: 2, 10146: 2, 12988: 2, 106442980: 2, 106202599: 2, 106464390: 2, 106650513: 2, 106384459: 2, 106193141: 2, 106411326: 2, 106916634: 2, 105929502: 2, 107387693: 2, 106713867: 2, 107109428: 2, 106253603: 2, 106077459: 2, 107173090: 2, 107361547: 2, 108252958: 2, 106771928: 2, 107803888: 2, 106670517: 2, 108019822: 2, 108435830: 2, 107552577: 2, 108118179: 2, 109847649: 2, 107652586: 2, 106032918: 2, 109050706: 2, 108082197: 2, 106703207: 2, 109664886: 2, 106630260: 2, 110307340: 2, 108121087: 2, 111811493: 2, 111276090: 2, 111735337: 2, 105822471: 2, 110908622: 2, 107763339: 2, 109808861: 2, 200062924: 2, 112420721: 2, 200142524: 2, 112103546: 2, 111936426: 2, 105823132: 2, 7071218: 2, 106974860: 2, 110331339: 2, 112162106: 2, 111660295: 2, 200662020: 2, 12258: 2, 12428: 1, 105815147: 1, 12698: 1, 106081147: 1, 108059981: 1, 108177328: 1, 109152722: 1, 107185927: 1, 111643513: 1, 11926: 0, 107593723: 0}"

P1 Climb the pleasant, black, left side of the slot to easier ground and continue up yet another, narrower slot in black rock. Belay on a spacious sandstone ledge below a blocky chockstone in the next slot. 5.6, a short pitch, ~30 meters.   P2 Climb up past the blocky chockstone, place gear (yellow camalotish), consider your fate, and step left onto the black, varnished ramp. Tiptoe up the ramp; choose between the utility of tiny nuts and reprieve from burning calves. After about 1/3 of the ramp, a move gains some calf reprieve and a green alien placement. More gear and more calf pain gains the top of the Senior Discount pillar & perhaps a double rope rappel (25 foot sling around block?). 5.9, another short pitch, ~30+meters. The anchor at the top of Senior Discount takes .3-.75 Camalot Jrs.   P3 Make a move to gain the thin crack/corner system on the right. At the top of the corner, step left and weave up steep huecos and flakes. At a long, nearly horizontal crack in good, black rock, head back right to the poorly defined arête. Up easier climbing for a long ways with rare gear placements in pink rock near or left of the blunt arête, eventually finding ample enough gear to construct an anchor. 5.9, 60 meters; the anchor takes yellow camalot +/-.   P4 Up and right onto the face right of the arête, angle up and right into a crack system/variation of Geronimo. 5.5, a short pitch, ~30 meters.   P5 An exposed step right gains the face on the right and then Geronimos summit rap station. 5.5, a very short pitch, <30 meters.","{109877052: 3, 14597: 1}"

The #5 camalot crack to the left is an alternate start at the same grade. ~30 meters, 5.10-    P2 Up the finger then fist crack. Belay on the rubble stance or continue on P3. Alternatively, step left, through and on oak trees; step across chasm to huecos and up P3. ~10 meters, 5.10-    P3 Step down left, and traverse left to the next, wide crack system. Up this to a belay at a ledge and an oak tree. ~30 meters, 5.7.     P4 Up the corner on the left side of the gulley system above the oak tree to a thin crack that angles left below a black headwall (it is possible to stay right and continue up the gulley; beware the agave top-out). From the left end of the headwall, ascend directly up. At the top of the headwall, walk back 10 meters to belay in oak trees. ~50 meters, 5.7.

It is striking shallow left facing corner, which varies from tips to wide hands with lots of variety in between.

The anchor is OK, definatly not the best I have seen but I have also seen many worse.  It could do with the bolts being replaced, and the webbing is looking a little faded.  The fixed nut is bomber and there are a couple beiners to lower/rap off.    Juggernaut is no give me, the face to the left is amazingly smooth and the crack pinches down pretty tight at times.

Two pitches of 5.7 chimney, roof and hand cracks leads to a ""zebra striped"" slab. A full pitch of up and over left on easy climbing deposits you at a small tree at the base of a nice 5.6 black finger crack that angles up and right. This pitch ends at a chimney beside a large block atop a detached pillar. Behind this pillar is a large bush in a bomb-bay flaring stem that leads up through a really great crack. This pitch ends at a horizontal crack after an exposed traverse right and a nice 5.7 black crack. Three more progressively easier pitches take you to the very top of Jack Rabbit Buttress.

The crux comes way up high when your tired and along with opinion of some other local boys, we thought it definitley is missing some holds at the crux 12 a/b pitch 7. It even shut down Tom who basically sent everything this winter, including an all free onsight of Sgt. Slaughter at solid 5.12b.     Anyhow it is a fun adventure none the less. Bring up to a 4 inch camalot and a bunch of long slings with biners, also half a dozen draws, and one seventy meter rope to rappel. I gave the route a PG-13 rating although it may be R. I'm not really good at grading stuff like that, but I guess you could say there is definitley places you don't want to fall. I remember pretty solid gear though for most of the hard climbing. Be ready for some loose rock, weird flares, sustained climbing, and some runouts all said. I don't want to sand bag anyone. If you haven't done the Original Route (Herbst/Hamilton), you should before this thing.    Approach: Hike to the base of the Original Route then break down and right toward the base of the obvious huge left faceing cleft (Brown Recluse) on the right side of the wall before Bird Hunter Buttress. You will eventually climb up some exposed 5.0 stuff toward the base of the first pitch (look for nice bolts). You will pass under a huge roof (Saurons Eye and what not).    Pitch 1: (5.10+) Climb up nice varnish with stout moves right off the bat. You will climb in the corner, then out, then in, and eventually pull up to a nice sized ledge with two anchor bolts for the belay. This pitch has at least 8 pro bolts.    Pitch 2: (5.11c?) Heads up off the start. If you blow the beginning moves (crux) off the start of the first pitch and your belay is too loose you can easily jack your ankles up bad. Climb hard crimp moves up past two bolts to gain a decent hand and fist crack with a pidgeon living inside. Climb up and toward the obvious roof (bolt) and out on jugs then up a loose and runout face to a semi-hanging belay with two more anchor bolts.    Pitch 3: (5.11c) Climb straight up semi varnished corner with semi solid rock (a few more bolts mixed with mostly gear) straight to another semi hanging stance with two more bolts for anchors.     Pitch 4: (5.9) Climb pretty much straight up the face/crack eventually breaking out way left to a another semi hanging stance with two more anchor bolts.     Pitch 5: (5.11) Climb straight out left off the belay to gain a crack/face system Go straight up with pretty stout 5.10 climbing to a hard move to gain the belay. Sort of scary.    Pitch 6: (5.10+) Let your friend climb this pitch. Climb off the belay on some pretty sandy shit in a corner. Cool exposure. Then continue for a ways up the arching/flaring/exciting/I want my mommy, wideness. Finally gaining your nicest ledge for a while to belay from with more bolts for anchors.    Pitch 7: (5.12a/b) Climb up past easy terrain in the corner off the belay then head up and right towards two bolts on the face above and right. Climb toward the overhanging corner via a wide crack. Catch a breath and try you best to send the overhanging stemming corner (more bolts) and gain the hanging belay with two bolts (1/4 inch?)    Pitch 8: (5.6) Grovel up the loose corner for a while and try not to kill your belayer. You will again find two bolts on the left wall.    Pitch 9: (5.5) Climb up and right then eventually back left to more bolts for the belay.     Descent: From here you can start you series of rappels. Rap straight down evetually ending up at the nice ledge at the top of ptich six. From here you will be rappeling straight down the face with anchors other than those of the route of ascent. You will see that the hangers at each belay from 1 to 5 don't have and rappel rings or webbing to bail from.     My friend and I didn't know this and ended up descending down the back of the Rainbow wall (epic in tight shoes) via a series of sketchy rappels, and somehow found the gunsight notch between the rainbow and brownstone in the dark.    I guess that's pretty much it. I hope this topo information is helpful for everyone. Have fun climbing.  ","{107016978: 3, 14611: 2}"

The Original Route,105732410,Trad,105732183,5.12-,1000,14,4.0,244.0,"The Original Route on the Rainbow Wall is perhaps Red Rocks finest route. It is certainly a crown jewel in terms of achievement: Once youve climbed it, things like Levitation 29 and Cloud Tower seem like cragging routes.     Once and strangely still a popular aid route, the Original Route is now all-free. During the free ascent in the mid '90's, 40-some-odd bolts were added to the climb. This is indeed absurd, and shortly thereafter all the bolts were chopped. Since then a handful of protection bolts have been replaced as well as bolted belays. It's too bad there are so many blemishes on the rock (both patched and unpatched bolt holes, and plenty of old relic bolts that need to be pulled). However, were it not for the scars from bashing pins, the route probably wouldn't go free at all.      Sustained, technical climbing, flawless rock, corner after steep corner of stems, locks, and intricate face sequences, and generally good gear lends this climb classic status.  In my opinion, all of those factors, combined with the ability to climb the route with a light rack and a single rope, an incredible view, and an approach that keeps the crowds away, make this one of the most perfect rock climbing experiences imaginable.     First things first: a WAG bag should be standard equipment for any Red Rocks climber. Pick one up before you hike in there, use it, and hike it out with you when you're done.    The line is obvious: The major dihedral system in the center of the wall. A couple landmarks include the half-way ledge (Over the Rainbow Ledge) and the Red Dihedral  a striking left-facing corner at the top of the wall.  The Original Route launches directly up into the corner system from below with a stout 12b pitch close to the deck, then follows some terraces up and right to Over the Rainbow Ledge and finally traverses back left and up to the Red Dihedral which is followed to the top of the wall.      The major variation to the climb is Dan McQuades Rainbow Country (5.12d) which straightens out the line by skipping the terraces leading up to Over the Rainbow Ledge in favor of some steep, hard face and crack pitches that link almost directly into the Red Dihedral. One should also note that Rainbow Country includes a variation to the left of the Original Route's first two pitches that avoids the 12b second pitch in favor of some very high quality 5.11d climbing, though the best way to climb it is via the harder, direct path.     A second major variation is that of the Swainbow Wall  basically an easy escape route that launches straight up from Over the Rainbow Ledge, avoiding the Red Dihedral altogether.      A sensible way to climb the route for the first time would be to climb the left-hand variation of pitches one and two, thus avoiding the 5.12b corner, then continuing with the Original Route to the top. On the last pitch of the Red Dihedral, one might consider taking a minor left-hand variation which is slightly easier (see the description for pitch 13 below). This path would maximize the high-quality climbing while keeping the difficulty in check at around 5.12a.      Perhaps the next time on the route, or for parties looking for the greatest challenge possible, the route could be climbed via the right-hand variation of the first two pitches (5.12b), the Rainbow Country variation (5.12d), and then the right-hand variation of pitch 13 (5.12b).      Some other minor notes: The climb is north facing and receives shade. Actually the Red Dihedral sees morning sun, but your chances of being there for it (barring a bivy on Over the Rainbow Ledge) seem slim dress accordingly. The approach is semi-arduous, and although it can be done in around 1:30, picking a path through the drainage of Juniper Canyon can be challenging the first time. Once underneath the wall, steep slabs present a final obstacle  these are sometimes made easier by perennial fixed lines. If the lines aren't in place, the slab can be climbed at 5.2 left of the fall line.    P1&2: Two options:  1) Begin directly below the corner system and climb 5.6 ledges and face to a belay at a modern bolt and a quarter-incher.  This short pitch of 5.6 can easily be linked into the next one.  Continue up into the blank corner past two bolts.  A reachy 5.12b move will get you to a bolted belay.  Excellent climbing.  2) Alternatively, begin well left of this start and climb up a leaning corner system past six bolts (being careful getting to the first bolt) to the belay above the 5.12b section.  This checks in at 5.11d and is also excellent.      P3: Step up into a wide layback immediately off the belay continuing through some decent stances.  Head up the corner until reaching an obvious point to wildly step out right onto the face (the aid line goes straight up).  Clip a bolt and then climb up the slightly past-vertical face past a second bolt before stepping back into the corner and continuing to a bolted belay.  Sustained, reachy, awesome!  5.11d.      P4: Continue straight up the crack system at mid-5.11?  This pitch is much easier than the last.  Belay at two bolts.    P5: This pitch is rated 5.11c but 5.11a might be more accurate.  Carefully ascend a long, hollow flake (decent gear), passing a bolt, then continue on easier ground up to a roof. Undercling and jam around it to the right.  Skip the first anchor (just past the roof) which is used for rapping, and belay above at another bolted anchor.  A long pitch.      P6: Continue up the right facing corner, deciding whether to continue up the Original Route or to take the direct line of Rainbow Country*  The rock is lower quality here but only slightly so.  Mid 5.10.  If following the original route, belay at some bolts by a small tree which at the start of the ledgy terrain.  There is a bit of fixed line here which you may wonder about  it facilitates rappelling the route with a 60m rope.      P7&8: Perhaps best simul-climbed Walk and scramble up and right and up and right, passing a few short, steep sections.  Theres maybe a move or two of generally well-protected 5.9 here and there, but most of it is 3rd and 4th class.  Eventually this reaches a bolt at a left-facing corner where the ledge system terminates.  Belay here.    P9: Traverse out right and around the arête onto the very exposed face.  Follow this up junky, but easy, rock to Over the Rainbow Ledge.  This is a short, exposed pitch of 5.6 or 5.7.    From this point decide whether to continue up the Original Route or to take the easy Swainbow Wall** escape.    P10: Traverse straight left off the belay on narrow foot ledges. Exposed! Gear is not too great here, but there is one old bolt and a cam placement or two. Out to the left theres a bolted anchor used for rapping, but the goal is to launch straight up to the base of the huge left-facing corner above (the Red Dihedral). Belay at bolts at the base of the Red Dihedral. 5.7-5.8.    P11: If you chose to avoid the 5.12b second pitch and Rainbow Country, this is the crux pitch. Although it is rated 11d, I believe it deserves 12a. Launch up the corner via liebacks, stems, and long reaches. The gear is quite good but some holds are better than others for placing it. The crux itself is not too far off the belay and is protected by a bomber glue-in bolt; creative stemming and reach helps here. Perhaps the best pitch on a climb full of amazing pitches. 5.12a.    P12: Continue up the corner with more of the same style of climbing. The first 20 feet are the hardest and it is more sustained than the previous pitch. High on the pitch there is a place to traverse left to a stance on the face and belay at a bolted anchor, despite the obvious path (the old aid line) continuing up the corner. The traverse itself has the potential for a nasty penji back into the corner  especially if the highest bolt, a 1/4 incher, were to fail. 5.11d/5.12a.    P13: Two options: 1) Traverse back into the corner and continue up to a stance beneath the roof. Move leftwards with creativity, trusting one's shoe rubber, eventually turning the roof system at it's left end. 5.12b. This is a Rainbow Country variation. For easier climbing... 2) Alternatively, from the belay downclimb and traverse left to a shallow left-facing corner. Climb up this to merge with the other variation just before it turns the roof. 5.11a.  Both variations pull through the roof at the same point on decent gear and some fixed pro. Belay at bolts up in a cave/alcove.    P14: Pull through the top of the cave on 5.10 flared hands and then continue up on easy ground, skipping a bolted belay out left. A short low fifth class scramble leads to a tree with rap slings and the top of the wall. There are also bolts way back from the edge.    Raps will take you generally down the route but sometimes onto the face to the left. The entire route can be rapped with a single 60m rope but a 70m makes it easier.      *Rainbow Country.  This basically makes an awesome climb completely superb by straightening out the line, avoiding all the ledgey crap, and adding several amazing pitches. First, do the harder starting pitch. Then, from the anchor at the top of P5, head up the right-facing corner, but instead of going right at the top, head up and left, skipping an intermediate anchor out left and heading up a system of steep flakes and cracks.  Runner your gear well as there is rope drag.  Belay at a bolted anchor above a huge hollow block.  5.11a, a long pitch.  From here, head up a crazy overhanging chimney system.  A few bolts protect.  At the top, pull over a bulge (wild 5.11) on jugs to a bolted belay.  Next is the crux (5.12d) pitch:  Do some interesting face climbing sequences past a few bolts to a stance below a shallow right-facing corner.  Using the corner and arete, perform a difficult to read sequence up to a precarious stem.  A few more moves lead to a thank-god hand jam and then a really exposed move back out onto the arete and up the wall above.  6 bolts and a single medium/large stopper placement near the top lead to a bolted belay.  Finally, traverse straight right (5.12a move) past three bolts and then up into the Red Dihedral, belaying at the base of P11 as described above. Finish with the 12b upper Red Dihedral variation.      **Swainbow Wall.  This is an easy escape to the top of the wall from Over the Rainbow Ledge.  I havent climbed it and wont attempt to describe it until I have, but I honestly cant imagine doing so  perhaps it would make sense if you find yourself at the ledge without enough daylight remaining to complete the Original Route.  Nevertheless, I would sooner bail from the amazing climbing of the Red Dihedral than miss out on it entirely.","{107088515: 4, 13956: 4, 10445: 4, 106400151: 4, 106034624: 4, 105902162: 4, 107488582: 4, 106881716: 4, 10168: 4, 105878950: 4, 107002494: 4, 105941791: 4, 105874629: 4, 13971: 4, 107294244: 4, 106720416: 4, 106246445: 4, 105849172: 4, 107937072: 4, 106220386: 4, 106974860: 4, 106027958: 4, 105790555: 4, 106280982: 4, 11272: 4, 106088739: 4, 14346: 4, 10380: 4, 106411326: 4, 106489544: 4, 105787381: 4, 105979363: 4, 11327: 4, 106951875: 4, 106985478: 4, 105805825: 4, 106861594: 4, 105084340: 4, 106160547: 4, 105887189: 4, 105892598: 4, 106335203: 4, 106858723: 4, 106441684: 4, 106349691: 4, 106135112: 4, 108150909: 4, 105957537: 4, 106697740: 4, 107682780: 4, 106351162: 4, 106201630: 4, 106885514: 4, 107292120: 4, 107894478: 4, 105952909: 4, 107508091: 4, 10364: 4, 106405973: 4, 106139652: 4, 14213: 4, 106482245: 4, 110006421: 4, 107650191: 4, 106774743: 4, 107723497: 4, 108154390: 4, 106958966: 4, 106690825: 4, 15142: 4, 105800489: 4, 108029460: 4, 107111603: 4, 108430112: 4, 107116841: 4, 110345219: 4, 106519623: 4, 105865653: 4, 108468640: 4, 106931153: 4, 107561580: 4, 110438772: 4, 105902636: 4, 107297910: 4, 110119598: 4, 109734887: 4, 106303677: 4, 108088043: 4, 108123128: 4, 106035216: 4, 107327702: 4, 11029: 4, 107800195: 4, 106843929: 4, 108824777: 4, 107888595: 4, 106725849: 4, 110166994: 4, 13115: 4, 10185: 4, 110262540: 4, 108023226: 4, 14330: 4, 109614047: 4, 107521989: 4, 105926739: 4, 108538771: 4, 106708690: 4, 105993404: 4, 106714648: 4, 7002067: 4, 107002071: 4, 105943577: 4, 10610: 4, 106273389: 4, 107288802: 4, 108797251: 4, 105951805: 4, 106334437: 4, 106895019: 4, 107377680: 4, 106788819: 4, 106602432: 4, 107246852: 4, 107585525: 4, 106744745: 4, 112070569: 4, 110700542: 4, 107108496: 4, 106444007: 4, 106125500: 4, 111585366: 4, 106949749: 4, 109117485: 4, 105787467: 4, 105850826: 4, 107878550: 4, 109649288: 4, 107941619: 4, 108353227: 4, 107682087: 4, 109104070: 4, 112495943: 4, 107218171: 4, 105790750: 4, 106194019: 4, 106679556: 4, 106838734: 4, 108002033: 4, 106619914: 4, 107453284: 4, 106407858: 4, 107094371: 4, 200225742: 4, 110540471: 4, 110110376: 4, 106860947: 4, 106073866: 4, 108083380: 4, 107600470: 4, 111055059: 4, 112411288: 4, 106735280: 4, 112068096: 4, 109041711: 4, 109491726: 4, 107633879: 4, 105894795: 4, 107205380: 4, 111979567: 4, 107151611: 4, 109932423: 4, 108092606: 4, 110650395: 4, 111709410: 4, 13937: 4, 107226876: 4, 14305: 4, 200367822: 4, 111835329: 4, 108936099: 4, 105935712: 4, 200472689: 4, 112506923: 4, 107896521: 4, 111233943: 4, 200045951: 4, 106835670: 4, 108451934: 4, 106585062: 4, 106735252: 4, 107328579: 4, 106616366: 4, 107696530: 4, 200561698: 4, 107178013: 4, 110359911: 4, 105990631: 4, 106649121: 4, 108647959: 4, 107616614: 4, 200420109: 4, 200657609: 4, 112212034: 4, 107016978: 4, 200749068: 4, 107102882: 4, 200785460: 4, 106496249: 4, 112310404: 4, 107361004: 4, 107990353: 4, 107401679: 4, 110244087: 4, 107533009: 4, 111821616: 4, 106915281: 4, 108550410: 4, 112147018: 4, 109859537: 4, 200281664: 4, 200628150: 4, 106030564: 4, 106226023: 4, 105829653: 4, 200248316: 4, 108205135: 4, 200446052: 4, 200093609: 4, 108511583: 4, 110752881: 4, 109807856: 4, 106827872: 4, 106028479: 4, 13672: 3, 12988: 3, 107956804: 3, 109152722: 3, 200405750: 3, 200963354: 3}"

Sergeant Slaughter,110100189,Trad,105732183,5.12b,1000,10,2.0,1.0,"Sergeant Slaughter is a burly adventure route with a few really good pitches. Though it has a reputation for loose rock, the only really bad one is the exit pitch. Great views, comfy belay ledges, and varied climbing that will demand much from the leader. This is one of those routes that feels a bit more like Yosemite than Red Rocks.  Identify the obvious right-facing corner of the crux second pitch at the far left end of the Rainbow Wall. The start is actually even further left than this, down around the corner from the massive apron of mossy slabs. Best to stay low when approaching.  P1: Climb a long, slabby crack. Lots of vegetation here but that's just the way it is. Belay at fixed nuts at the left end of a long ledge system capping the apron. 150', 5.7.  P2: Up the left side of a narrow, green pillar with good pro. Step right at the top to the first of two right-facing corners. Tips liebacking leads up to a roof. Arrange pro and step right again into the massive, steep corner. More tips liebacks that suddenly open up wide. A physical struggle ensues on the way to a bolted anchor on an exposed ledge out left. 120', 5.12b.  P3: Delicately tip toe up a pizza-box flake right of the main corner before moving up into the flare above. A bit frightening but it's over quickly. Enjoyable chimneying and thrutching leads to a steep, awkward finish at a bolted anchor. Easily linked (recommended) into the next pitch - this is just the warmup! 100', 5.11a PG13.  P4: ""This pitch is called the Bitch Pitch and you will find out why,"" says first ascensionist and guidebook author Roxanna Brock. I have nothing to add. 60' to a bolted anchor, 5.11c.  P5: An interesting pitch. Traverse right off the belay passing a bolt, then up a crack to the Rotten Honeycomb Pillar. Careful here. Move right again past another bolt and then up easily to a bolted belay on a nice ledge. 130', 5.11a PG13.  P6: Climb a narrow, decomposing left-facing corner, then step right and continue easily up to the massive bivy ledge. Belay off a bolted anchor. 110', 5.10a PG13.  P7: Move/extend the belay far left in an alcove at the base of the gaping chimney. My partner (the late Brad Gobright - God bless him) refused to do this which led to me indulging the temptation to tunnel deep into the chimney in hopes of finding security only to get stuck necessitating a down climb. Instead, confidently chimney straight up to a lone 1/4"" bolt* which can be backed up with a #5 Camalot. Shortly above this transition into a lieback and continue up and left onto the top of a blocky, exposed tower. From here, move up a right-facing corner with spaced gear and then step right (exciting) to a seam. Continue up this and through a difficult Western Rosebud tree growing out of the crack, and belay on a great ledge with a bolted anchor. 140', 5.11a PG13.  (*)The 1/4"" bolt on this pitch is a bummer: If you trusted the bolt, or if it were replaced with something more bombproof, you could conceivably leave the #5 Camalot behind and go a bit lighter with the rack. Perhaps the next party up could bring a bolt kit instead of the #5 Camalot, replace this sucker, and do all future parties a huge favor?  P8: Clip another 1/4"" bolt a couple feet above the anchor and immediately bust left onto the arete and face climb easily up. Move right to an obvious, attractive flake, then move right again and continue up blocky rock to a bolted anchor. 110', 5.10c.  P9: Move down and left from the belay underneath a massive hanging slab and then up onto the slab at a blunt arete via some slightly hollow rock. Clip a bolt, and continue up and left into a long, weird corner with tricky pro. Pull awkwardly over and belay off a pine tree on a big ledge that feels like it should be the top. 110', 5.10c PG13.

From here set a belay anchor (recommended) using micro nuts.  Climb up through tricky lay backing then into slightly easier climbing when feet appear.  Negotiate an offwidth section and place your last gear before the slab chimney runout to a large slung horn.     This route could continue upwards for another easier pitch before running into the upper pitches of One-Arm Bandit.,{106974860: 2}

Getting up into the crack can be tricky, considering the roof starts right off the deck. My buddy had to stack two rocks and stand on them to follow me.

Jaws II,111051688,Trad,105732108,5.10b,435,3,3.0,1.0,"Jaws II follows a large left facing corner up good rock that will eventually eat you and spit you out. You can expect some wideness and run-out chimney climbing on Pitch 2, which in whole is the main attraction.     Get geared up on the ground then scramble up to a large bush in the corner system, belay here.     Pitch 1 - 5.6 50' -  Start off a bush and follow easier corner climbing to a short vertical wide pod.  After this follow the slab corner to the base of the massive chimney.  Belay off a chock stone.     Pitch 2 - The Jaws - 5.10b 180' - Quest up the chimney chasm, generally keeping a little deeper inside until you can place gear after about 30'. It's a bit sandy in there. Start moving up and diagonally left until the chimney shuts and you must exit back out.  Pull the lip and continue up the finger, off fingers, and handish crack corner.  This eventually opens back up to a chimney again and you can squeeze up a good ways exiting in an alcove.      Pitch 3 - 5.6 205' - Face climb up good rock generally aiming for a left facing corner with a bush.  Climb the corner until you top out the feature and then traverse right on a ledge to reach the shared summit with Olive Oil.    Descent - If you left your packs at the base it is best to take an alternate descent from the typical Olive Oil descent.  From the summit, head west and drop down a bit until you reach a cairn. Now head left (South) and head down onto a slab.  Traverse West on the slab and stay high when a chimney gap is reached that you could jump but probably shouldn't.  Drop into some bushes near the top of the gap and walk down it until it is easy to step onto the other (right hand) side of the slab.  Continue traversing West on this slab for a while until the gully starts to become visible on the left.  Go a little further aiming for two trees in the gully near the base of the slab.  Here you hike down into the jungly gully back to the base of the route.    Or if you have all your stuff, take the standard Olive Oil descent gully.",{106974860: 3}

Start well around the left side of Rose Tower, up a gully of sorts at the base of a big corner/ramp.  P1: Begin at a rounded buttress just up and left from a deep recess. Climb slabby rock with sparse pro to a narrow alcove with a sandy floor and huecoed wall.  P2 & 3 (link): Climb straight up nice, exposed cracks just right of the major, right-facing corner, and then step back left into the corner at the top, promptly arriving at a cramped belay perch. This pitch is 200' long.  P4: From the belay on the ledge to the left, traverse right 10 feet, follow juggy rock up and into a left-facing corner (or stay on the face). Continue up, being careful not to go too high, and move around to the right to a spacious belay ledge.  P5: Climb up off the belay at a weakness and traverse right again across a slab and up into a dihedral. Continue up this until it ends, then scramble off right and up to the top.  Descent: From the summit scramble off the back of the tower (two short downclimbs may require a spot). From here drop down and right into the Olive Oil Descent Gully (the gully to climber's right of The Rose Tower).

Rose Tower - Original Route,105797697,Trad,105732108,5.7,800,7,1.0,3.0,"The original route on the Rose Tower was first climbed by Larry Hamilton and Joe Herbst in early 1976.  Climb a few hundred feet of class 3, 4 and 5 to a large platform approximately halfway up the wall.  At this point the FA team worked their way into the rightmost crack on the face.  The direct approach to the crack involves some very loose rock (and looks to be harder than 5.7!).  There is an old bolt off to the right that may have been used for pro.  Their route continued straight up the crack and eventually finished in the huge corner that later became the last pitch of Olive Oil.    Note that this route is included mostly for historical interest.  When I was up there, I was kind of spooked by the rock and the fact that the climbing looked much more serious than the neighboring Olive Oil.  The FA team recalled only a relaxed, fun-in-the-sun kind of day, so I may be missing something.","{105817062: 2, 12463: 1}"

Black Orpheus,105732809,Trad,106042253,5.9+,1500,8,3.3,330.0,"Black Orpheus wanders up the large hindquarters of Solar Slab, culminating in a giant arcing right-facing corner that has by far the best climbing on the route.  The route is long, but much of the climbing is easy and a fair bit of it is mediocre.  Two stars is generous, but it makes for a pretty fun adventure with a little bit of challenging route-finding and more commitment (due to the wnadering line and lack of fixed anchors) than many long routes in Red Rocks.      Hike past the main face of Solar Slab into the main Oak Creek drainage, continuing until the large and complex wall in the photo below appears.  Leave your stuff below 600' of slabs, and scramble up to a long left-facing corner approximately in the middle of the wall, and left of a large flatiron feature.  Locate the large RF corner on the upper left portion of the wall; the final 4 pitches follow this corner, and the route starts quite a ways to the right of it before wandering up and over.    Pitches one and two are long 5.8 leads up the corner (bypass the bolted anchors in order to stretch these leads).      P3 is easier and wanders left and then back right at about 5.5.    P4 is very easy fifth class and over 300 feet long; basically, simul-climb while finding the easiest path up and left to the main corner system on the upper wall.  Belay in a comfy alcove down and right of a clean V-slot corner.    P5 is the jewel of the route: do exciting face moves up and left past a bolt into the corner, and climb for 150 wonderful feet, passing a cool chimney en route to a good belay ledge below 2 bolts.    P6 climbs past the bolts with a cool, tricky 5.9 move which for some reason has been upgraded to 5.10 in Supertopo.  Continue up the cracks above which are are really good.  Several belays are possible.    P7 continues up the huge corner with stiff for 5.7 liebacking past a bolt.  Where the corner arcs right, traverse the face straight right to a fixed belay.    P8 is one of the wilder 5.5 pitches I've done.  Follow a few bolts right and then up on runout, loose, exposed but awesome face climbing.  Cut back left through the main corner into a groove that leads to the top.    The descent is fairly involved.  We scrambled up to the next ledge (well short of the buttress top), then followed this left (west) and down a ramp with a line of cairns to a new bolted rappel station.  You have to downclimb an easy chimney to get to the station. Two double-rope raps got us to a large bowl, which we followed down and skiers' right to a terrace with a large boulder.  From here, take the ramp west into the Oak Creek drainage and follow that back to your packs.  You can do three raps with a single 60m rope (using a mid station after the first one), but the last one WILL NOT REACH GROUND.  With a lot of stretch and a big swing to the left, you can barely reach a 4th class ramp and get off.  But you'll probably die.  Not recommended.    Another rappel route from the top of the buttress uses several single rope raps to get into the bowl.  It may also be possible to traverse across the top of Solar Slab and descend the gully east of that route.

The Black Widow,107506973,Trad,106042253,5.12,500,4,3.0,7.0,"The Black Widow is a route that offers difficult, technical climbing on the first pitch, a fun roof on the second pitch, and an extended boulder problem crux followed by exposed glory climbing on the third pitch. This rig is sure to be sunny, is crowd-free, and is a totally rad rock climb. Just goes to show that great FA's in Red Rocks are still out there.    Up and right from the top of the approach gully is a pleasant area adorned with sizable, flat boulders. This is beneath a large, black, scoop-like cavity in the wall; begin climbing at the toe of a slabby buttress just left of this cavity.    P1 (5.11b, 135'): Climb up a low angle crack to a ledge beneath the steep, black wall above. Clip the first of several bolts and climb up and right into a water groove/crack system. Follow this past a thin face climbing crux and continue to a bolted anchor at a small hole.    P2 (5.10d, 120'): Face climb directly above the anchor with spaced protection to a body-length, horizontal roof. A bolt at the lip protects pulling the roof, but this can be very difficult to clip for those of shorter stature. Kick the feet free and heel hook over the lip, stand up, and continue up the face above to another bolted anchor at a tiny ledge.    P3 (5.12, 120'): Face climb directly above the anchor on fragile rock to the steep underbelly of the arch. Twenty feet of well-protected, but intense, dynamic, and improbable climbing leads to better holds and a chance for a shake. Note that there is one small flake here that would probably rip right off if you pulled too hard on it - I used it gently in order to get a shake, so for that reason I elected not to clean it. A few more tricky moves get you out from underneath the arch and up onto the exposed upper headwall. Follow a beautiful, steep crack system for 90' to a belay stance on white rock.    P4 (5.7, 125'): Romp up the lower angle slab (unprotected), or slightly left along a nice finger crack, and then work back right to a final vertical, varnished face. Climb one of several cracks up this to a belay stance 100' from the IBM Boulder.    Rap the route with an 80m (a 70 is just not quite adequate) or two ropes, or walk over and rap Plate of Fate, or walk off via the Painted Bowl descent.","{105796642: 4, 108417349: 4, 106951875: 4, 107650191: 3, 108327704: 3, 10168: 3, 106407858: 0}"
Eurydice,113918881,Trad,106042253,5.10b,240,2,3.3,6.0,"Eurydice is a direct finish to Black Orpheus that replaces the chossy exit slab with two new pitches of spectacular climbing: a wild traverse into outer space and a 5.5 romp with 1000 feet of exposure nipping at your heels - separated by one of the more outrageous belay ledges in all of Red Rocks! If you're climbing Black Orpheus and are up for one more small section of 5.10 at the end of the day, this is unquestionably the way to finish!    P1-9 (5.9+ or 5.10a, 1100'): Begin by climbing through the crux of Black Orpheus (P1-9 in the Handren guide), belaying on the higher of two large ledges in the massive upper corner.    P10 (5.10b, 120'): Climb up the corner as per the original line, but instead of ""traversing out right on sloping ledges to the anchor"", continue up the corner another body length or two (good medium wires) to a jug. This jug is the start of a ledge/catwalk that breaches the overhanging left wall of the corner. From the jug, hand traverse wildly until it is possible to swing up onto the ledge (crux). Follow this sickeningly exposed ledge all the way out the corner to an incredible crow's nest belay platform and build an anchor in varnished rock using small/medium wires and a small cam (0.3 Camalot or the like).    P11 (5.5, 120'): Climb straight up the slab, hugging the arete (exposed!) until the angle eases very close to the start of the Painted Bowl descent route.","{10168: 4, 111359086: 4, 107323239: 3, 106838734: 3, 110711088: 3, 106714648: 3}"
Howl's Moving Castle,107561683,Trad,106042253,5.11c,400,4,2.0,5.0,"Howl's Moving Castle tackles the obvious weakness in the massive roof on the right side of the main Black Arch Wall in four short, interesting pitches. This is a good route except for a little loose rock here and there and a brief dirty section. All of this might clean up with traffic, but even in its current state the route offers diverse climbing and fantastic exposure on the last two pitches in particular.  Having spent way too much time up there this season, my eye was inevitably drawn towards this line. When we finally made time to check it out, we discovered a bolted anchor halfway up the lower corner, however, there was no evidence of progress beyond the first two pitches it appeared that whoever had been up there previously stopped beneath the crux roof pitch (I'd love more information if anyone out there knows anything) - so we kept going! What resulted was essentially a ground-up FA of a sweet new line. I led pitches one, two, and four onsight and followed Josh Thompson cleanly on the crux third pitch, returning a few days later to lead every pitch.  Begin directly below the left-arching, left-facing corners that form the right side of the main Black Arch Wall. Scrambling up some 4th class to a bushy ledge to begin the first pitch is recommended, but it is possible to begin below this on the more spacious slabs.  P1 (5.10b, 75-150' depending on where you start): Climb straight up from the bushy ledge towards the left end of another bushy ledge that is directly below an obvious chimney at the base of the corner. Chimney up this (unprotected) and then work out left from the top of the chimney (good gear) to a roof at the base of the corner. Arrange gear here and pull awkwardly up over the roof, stepping easily left to a bolted belay atop a large flake. It is possible for the second to avoid the chimney by climbing up a large slabby flake, but this is not recommended for the leader as the flake is crumbling and there is no worthwhile gear until the top of the chimney.  P2 (5.10b with 5.9 R or 5.11a, 80'): Step right and up off the belay, and then continue up the slick, leaning corner. Liebacks and ultimately fist jams lead up this to a good stem rest. Here the corner pinches down to tips: Continue up with liebacks (crux) until the corner thankfully, and abruptly, widens. Here, gain a large flake and clip a bolt before performing a thin mantle followed by easier climbing up and left to a bolted anchor at a comfortable stance. It is also possible to traverse left at the stem rest and climb the unprotected face before stepping back right after the thin liebacks, thus changing the grade of this pitch to 5.10b (with 5.9 R). Otherwise, the pitch is 5.11a.  P3 (5.11c, 90'): From the ground this roof appears to be a 30' monster, but youll see it isnt so bad. Climb up via steep, positive, but very powerful liebacks to a few handjams and a final burly move turning the lip. Stopping to place gear on this bit is difficult, but overall the holds are really good. Once around the corner, there's about 10' of dirty rock that can mostly be avoided, but the exposure is spectacular as the climbing eases to a vertical, 5.9 romp up the crack system to a good belay ledge out right.  P4 (5.10d, 75'): Continue up the crack system through soft white rock. This bit of climbing is way steeper than it looks, but is well-protected and actually quite good. Belay just above the top of the wall at a comfortable stance.  Walk off via the Painted Bowl descent or rap Plate of Fate with a single 70m rope.","{106892144: 3, 10168: 2, 10445: 2, 107562716: 2, 109152722: 1}"

Mostly following interesting corners, the climb is capped by two lovely, testy pitches.  It is south facing and offers nice, sunny climbing  perfect for a clear winter day.  Approach as for Black Orpheus, but head left across the slabs (may require some exposed easy 5th class) and away from Black Orpheus to reach an indistinct weakness below the left side of the towering buttress above. You may arrive at a small, body-sized cave that is just left of the line and just to the right of a narrow ridge of rock that separates the Black Orpheus side of the amphitheater from the There and Back Again side. About 20' below this cave is a nice ledge and a single bolt which is a good place to begin.    P1: As for Tuscarora - depending on where you start, begin climbing up a corner and onto broken rock, working out left then back right underneath a steep wall, then continue just right of a vegetated right-facing corner to a nice ledge with a bolted anchor.  5.5-5.8.    P2: Again, as for Tuscarora - climb up interesting features passing two bolts to a bolted anchor on a sloping ledge directly below the large roof.  5.10b, 100.    P3: Traverse right via an easy, but exposed move on a loose ledge system to a bolted anchor at the base of a short, steep corner. Low 5th class, 50'.    P4: Climb up a very steep left-facing corner passing two bolts to a bolted anchor on a ledge.  5.11, 50'.    P5: Head up a corner to the right (don't go straight up) and pull up with difficulty onto a long, leaning left-facing ramp system.  There are several bolts and well-spaced but solid gear placements along this ramp - the very end of the system is steep, run out, and difficult, but the climbing is beautiful and face holds appear to ease the passage.  End at a bolted anchor.  5.11d, 120'.    Rappel from here with a 70m rope, following the ramp back down (a leaver 'biner on one or two of the bolts will make this much easier).  Alternatively, it is possible to continue up to the top of the formation via a huge right-facing corner system which faces Black Orpheus.

It is a fantastic pitch that is sustained and has two difficult,  interesting, and exciting cruxes - one of which is the very last set of moves to a finishing jug.    Begin on the SW face of a large brown block (see Location description below) beneath the two left-facing corners.  Climb easily up the first corner passing three bolts and gear placements to the corner's end.  Move wildly up and right across the face towards the second corner (first crux) and mantle up to a stance in the corner itself.  Continue upwards with good gear and two more bolts before making a difficult reach (second crux) at the top to a blind hold.  Pull over onto a slabby topout.      There is currently no anchor on the top of this formation and finding good gear is difficult (but possible).

For us it was the perfect choice on a frigid December day when the somewhat lengthy approach kept us warm. The route is south facing, so perfect for cooler days.    Granted there are a few brief sections of loose rock, but the harder moves are solid and well protected with either bolts or gear.   Route Description   Pitch 1 (120', 5.8)   Clip the first bolt then move right into a narrow crack system. Take care as some of the rock is fractured. Continue up past a second bolt to a bolted anchor.    Pitch 2 (90', 5.8+)   From the belay go left and up. From the belay you see mostly loose plates but there is solid rock to be found once you commit. Traverse left on the varnish past one bolt then head up to a ledge with bushes. As of Dec 2009 the bush was slung with cords and a rap ring.    Pitch 3 (100', 5.9+)   Tiptoe up and left on thin, varnished holds past 2 bolts. Head up toward the brushy, bolted belay/rap station. Note the pile of loose rocks next to the anchor.   Descent   RAP   From the anchor do a single rope rap down and climber's right to the brushy ledge that marks the top of pitch 2. If you have a second rope rap to the base. If not, there is an alternate rap station part of the way straight down (not the top of pitch 1, which is off to the climber's right). We did not use this, but noted that the cordage was UV damaged as of Dec 2009.    WALK-OFF   There is a (lengthy) walk-off option. From the top of the route head up into Painted Bowl. From here go SW aiming the large boulder on the west shoulder of the ebowl. Note: you will have to contour before the (IBM) boulder comes into view. Continue west until the ramps become a vegetated terrace. Head down a steep gully and zig-zag down the ramp system. The final crux involves getting down 20' of extremely slick water-polished slab to reach the streambed. Head downstream to the trail system and return to your car.","{106792700: 3, 11591: 3, 105801659: 3, 108327704: 2, 13965: 2, 10445: 2, 105805486: 2, 106116385: 2, 106838734: 2, 10168: 1}"

This is a great new route with wild and burly climbing, mostly excellent rock, and great pro.  No move is harder than 10d, probably, but the cumulative effects of placing gear and sussing out the sequences on the fly are quite taxing - though knee barring and hand jamming skills can take the sting out of it. Super fun!    Beginning immediately left of the Plate of Fate, climb the left margin of the namesake plate and, with some difficulty, pull up onto better rock above. From here the route follows a vague seam/corner passing spaced but good gear to a large wedged flake. There is a tricky but bomber cam placement immediately above this flake.  Continue via liebacks and kneebars to a strange hole-thingy in the wall above the arch (crucial 0.75 Camalot placement). Pull past this, up and over, to a precarious stance on really nice rock - take some time to catch your breath because its about to be game on: Moving left, step back down below the arch, and begin a wild traverse left via underclings, hand jams, and occasional jugs. There's not much for feet, but some trickery affords much needed rests before a final, burly reach left to a large, flat hold at the lip of the arch.  Mantling onto this might not be the crux... but it will certainly feel that way.  And while things may seem desperate, the pro is good so you must go for it! You must! Once up above the arch, a thin move or two leads to the final station on the Plate of Fate rap route. Nice! Enjoy the bird's eye view of your partner struggling as you bring him/her up. Remember, a 70m cord is not long enough to lower to the ground while the rope is still running through all the gear, so rapping off is the way to go.","{10168: 4, 10445: 4, 106999262: 4, 106892144: 4, 111841723: 2}"

Approach as for Black Orpheus, but head left across the slabs (may require some exposed easy 5th class) and away from Black Orpheus to reach an indistinct weakness below the left side of the towering buttress above.

The obvious right-leaning finger crack and best looking line on the cliff.    The belayer may wish to anchor in or tie-off to a tree before getting started. Climb up a low-angle face to the main wall, tie off shrubbery, and delicately fiddle in some overhead RP's. They seem OK, but the rock is the white, sugary sort. Perform a committing stand up move, and then pray the edge of the crack doesn't snap as you pad your feet up a little higher to reach your first solid gear placement. This is immediately followed by a hard crux. After this, expect alternating sections of finger jamming and good rests for about 80'.

Once into the corner system, stem your way up.  The back of the corner will pinch down to nothing for some stretches, leaving few gear options.  Go left at the end of the corner system, and up a short crack system.  This will lead to a huge ledge that currently has a bunch of slings making a rappel station.

Do not go up the corner on the left side of the ledge.     Lead up through a bouldery leaning lieback with some fragile rock and mildly inspiring gear.

It was also early January, so I knew I couldn't go overboard with the minimal amount of daylight. The E Arete, noted as a worthy alpine style excursion, caught my eye.  There was barely any beta listed in Handren beyond the approach and the fact it starts in the gully. I had done the approach to Inti Watana twice before and the long descent off the summit once (mostly in the dark), so I realized it could be a long day but I wasn't going in completely blind.

Editorial Commentary   It's definitely not sustained climbing (we soloed most of it) and there's plenty of shrubbery. Not surprisingly there was some friable rock in spots. But if you're down for an alpine-like adventure route with hard to beat summit views and don't have a ton of daylight, then this could be your route.

Mountain Beast,105732665,Trad,105732036,5.11-,700,8,2.3,8.0,"Mountain Beast is a fine route for those who have done the far more classic routes on the Eagle Wall. A few pitches are outstanding, but others are very lackluster. Begin at the far upper right margin of the Eagle Wall, approximately 150' right of Levitation (5.11), and 30' left of the saddle that drops down to the East. Belay from a nice flat area - you should be able to spot the anchors at the end of the first pitch in a heart-shaped alcove.  P1: Follow a left-leaning crack system to a ledge, then up a short corner with a hand crack to the bolted belay. 5.9.  P2: Step out of the alcove to the right, head up past a few bolts, then trend straight left past three more bolts and the crux - a very thin 15' or so section of climbing. Belay in another alcove. A good pitch. 5.11.  P3: Face climb up and up and up. Belay on a ledge in the large left-facing, right-leaning corner/ramp system. 5.6-8?  P4: Climb up a corner then leave the corner and traverse left and up slightly to a two-bolt anchor. 5.9.  P5: Face climb up past 9 bolts and a few wire placements to a two-bolt anchor and semi-hanging belay stance. Many of the holds are fragile on this pitch and a delicate touch helps. 5.10.  P6: Climb up the beautiful face past two bolts and then up a dead-vertical black wall, slotting bomber wires in amazing incut pods. The best pitch on the climb - 5.9+. Belay at a two bolt anchor.  P7: Wander up and slightly right on lower angle terrain (somewhat more tricky to protect), eventually moving right to belay on a flat ledge at a large tree. 5.6-8?  P8: Continue up the extremely contrived white slab past seven or so bolts (pretend not to see the much more beautiful dihedral to your right) to a two-bolt belay just below the summit.  Many of the pitches can be linked. We did it in 5.  Walk off or rap Levitation with two ropes. With some slings around the tree, it may be possible to rap Mountain Beast with two ropes.","{12522: 3, 106671438: 3, 105951805: 3, 10168: 2, 10445: 2, 105829653: 2, 107732625: 2}"
Rainbow Buttress,105732368,Trad,105732036,5.8+,1200,8,3.1,86.0,"This is the easiest way up the Eagle Wall.  Given the length of the approach and descent, it's a long day.  Due to lack of fixed anchors, you cannot rap this route so plan on going over the top (leave extra water, etc in the creek bed before heading up the the base of the wall).    I found the crux pitch a bit scary for 5.8, there is pro but some 15' runouts, but a 5.9 leader should have no problem with it (except for this one pitch, the rest didn't even seem 5.8).  The final pitch used to be very runout but there is now a bolted alternative.    I've heard several negative opinions on this route from people who would give it one or even zero stars.  The rock is not as good as it is on other routes to the left.  I enjoyed the length and position of the route, so I give it 1.5 stars rounded up.  If you are up for the challenge, Eagle Dance or Leviation 29 are much more highly regarded.    Follow the approach ramp up and right, past the start of Eagle Dance and Levitation 29, until you reach a sort of a col where you can look down into the Painted Bowl.  The route begins at the col.  We found the route fairly easy to follow using Swain's description, just follow the easiest line up cracks to the right of a buttress leading up.  We thought we would be able to chat with friends on Lev 29 but this is around the corner and no communication was possible.    After about five pitches there are two alternatives: (1) head up and then angle left as in this                Eagle Wall from the lower Painted Bowl with routes marked (note that bottom pitches of these routes are not visible due to the ""foreground bump"")      , or (2) traverse right to an obvious left facing corner (easy), belay and then climb the corner (crux).  The second alternative seems to be slightly harder but is followed by many parties (including us) because it is such an obvious corner.    Eventually you will reach a final slab, the original 8th pitch went up and left 5.5X to the summit.  However now there are a bunch of bolts leading straight up at about 5.7 for a much less terrifying finish.    Swain claims the descent can be done in an hour, but this is speedy.  We followed his descent description and made no wrong turns; we were not in a hurry as we were hoping our friends on Lev 29 would catch up so it took us at least 2 hours from the top all the way to the car.

The Friar,105732854,Trad,105914871,5.9,300,4,2.5,52.0,"This route is relatively easy to find as it finishes on a large boulder perched atop a column of rock roughly 250-275 feet tall.  As you are following the trail into Oak Creek it would be most efficient to keep your eye out for a faint trail near the mouth of the canyon that breaks off northwest at a large, scoop of vanilla ice cream boulder roughly the size of five golf carts or 8 donkeys of relatively equal mature stature.  Continue the approach as for Johnny Vegas and its neighbors but cut north earlier - when you are even with the column of rock with the boulder on it - and aim for the southeast section of the column where you will find an obvious varnished right facing corner.  Red Zinger will be visible directly to the east across a small gully.    P1, 5.7: Climb the beautiful corner to a comfy ledge where you could bivy if you got lost on the approach.  This pitch is as sweet as a pint of New York Super Fudge Chunk.    P2, 5.7: Continue from the belay up and right on some peanut brittle to a short left leaning hand crack.  Fire this wicked, two move splitter and head up and left to a small ledge with a bolted belay.  Keep looking left for the small ledge or you will miss it like I did and have to build a belay on another ledge the size of Missouri, which works out well when you have to pee in the middle of belaying your second.  Hint: if you are on a ledge the size of Missouri, you have gone too far...unless you have to pee.  A decent pitch - Albertson's French Vanilla maybe.    P3, 5.6R: Climb straight up from the bolted belay to a steep but short section off of the Missouri ledge; get what will probably be your last piece of gear for 25-35 feet, then meander up and left on white slabtastic rock to a two bolt anchor.  Clip this and keep going up and left on a ledge around the summit boulder until you see an obvious and perfect belay crack at about waist height.  Mediocre pitch - Ice Cream Sangwhich.    P4 5.9PG:  Climb up and left from the belay on steep jugs in a flakey cracky thingy, then rock over to your right and traverse the face (bit of sphincter pucker possible) to an arete.  Get a good horse stance and clip an archaic rusty bolt.  Head straight up to the summit and a bolted anchor doing some more cool steep moves.  A good pitch with some nice monkey moves on it, well worth doing but very short.  Pint of Chunky Monkey.    Descent: Rap the route with one rope.  Rap from atop the boulder to the anchors you clipped and passed on the 3rd pitch.

Mostly fun, 5.9 jamming and laybacking with a technical stem/reach at 3/4 height.  This pitch has several stances/rests and ends at a rap station on a big ledge.    P2: 35', 5.10+.  Though Swain rates these two pitches the same, P2 is harder, particularly to lead.  The crux is quite reminiscent of The Wave on Supercrack Buttress at Indian Creek -- laybacking around a bulge; have a 1.5 Friend size piece ready to go.  After about 35' the crack ends at a large roof where there is a rap station.  Two short raps to descend. A single 60m rope might just make it from the second anchor to the ground.  If you don't do the continuation described below, the leader will be a lot more comfortable if he/she lowers from the end of the 2nd pitch and belays from the first rap station.    It is possible to continue from the second anchor by slab traversing left about 15' and joining the crack system to left which has its own anchors and which Swain rumors to be 5.9 but looks harder. This continuation would add about 50' of climbing and provides an interesting contrast in styles --an abrupt transition from power laybacking to tenuous slabbing -- but is somewhat tricky to protect for the 2nd on without a big piece (~4.5 Camalot).  The crux of the traverse is at the start, so the leader is protected adequately.  Once the traverse is over, the crack above, which we did not climb, appears to require wide hand pieces, maybe 3 and 3.5 Camalots.

Solar Flare,105836970,Trad,105914866,5.10-,500,5,2.4,70.0,"This is a good quality line.  The rock is mostly solid and the climbing is mostly moderate.  However, it does ""flare"" up at two distinct cruxes.  The second and succeeding belays have bolted anchors that would allow retreat with a single 60-meter rope.  It MIGHT be possible to rappel from the pitch-2 anchors slightly right to reach a bolted station at the top of Corona, and go from there to the ground.    Pitch 1: A pleasant crack leads up 100' to a small stance beneath an overhang.   Pitch 2: Traverse right to a break in the roof and move up past a bolt (5.10) to easier climbing and a bolted belay station.   Pitch 3: Easy climbing up the corner above takes you to another bolted belay station.   Pitch 4: Continue up, passing a protection bolt (5.9) on the bulge above, to reach another bolted station.   Pitch 5: Moderate climbing goes up the cracks and face to the Lower Shoulder.  There is an optional bolted belay/rap station a short distance below the shoulder.    Descend by rappeling the route.  All the upper pitches can be rapped with one rope (which is probably advisable because there are a lot of snaggy horns).  There is not a bolted station at the top of pitch one, so it easiest to do a 2-rope rappel from the P2 anchors.","{105802459: 4, 106755817: 4, 106662918: 3, 106670517: 3, 112257318: 3, 107786859: 3, 107532913: 3, 107636562: 3, 106838734: 3, 108023481: 3, 107860997: 3, 105947198: 3, 106577584: 3, 108507815: 3, 107325508: 3, 108154390: 3, 200157339: 3, 107993865: 3, 106975876: 3, 106909061: 3, 105961272: 3, 200107185: 3, 106685212: 3, 11609: 3, 108149490: 3, 106677257: 3, 10850: 3, 106697740: 3, 110459813: 3, 200070835: 3, 200048536: 3, 106601971: 3, 108029322: 2, 106679556: 2, 112131062: 2, 109359725: 2, 107390765: 2, 108438775: 2, 111901710: 2, 105801687: 2, 14597: 2, 109554938: 2, 105871395: 2, 105814383: 2, 106162948: 2, 106983134: 2, 105829653: 2, 15023: 2, 105805486: 2, 105820266: 2, 106554608: 2, 106031405: 2, 106119518: 2, 107301514: 2, 107065373: 2, 108277529: 2, 106926051: 2, 107009689: 2, 111284682: 2, 109424881: 2, 11591: 2, 109858158: 2, 105975214: 2, 11156: 2, 107159816: 2, 200130766: 1, 14442: 1, 10168: 1, 108746269: 1}"
Solar Slab Gully,105732227,Trad,105914866,5.3,540,5,2.0,253.0,"Solar Slab Gully is mainly used as an approach to get to the upper face and climb Solar Slab.  The climbing is not particularily appealing, but still fun.  The pitches are not very distinct, and many belay spots are possible.  Follow the prominent trail that starts at the Oak Creek Canyon parking lot for 45 minutes to an hour or so to get to a huge gully on the right.    P1) Pick a route up the gully.  Many possiblities exist.  A wide crack is in the middle of the face, or a smaller crack to the right.  Step around left eventually to a fixed anchor. (5.1)    P2) Scramble and chimney up the left side of the gully.  When the gully opens up, a belay is possible at an oak tree with slings to the right.  Another option is to continue until a wide steeper section is encountered. (4th class)    P3) Climb up this water worn area passing a sling-threaded hole.  This is a possible belay, but it is best to continue on.  Belay when comfortable. (5.1)    P4) Scramble up to a vertical wide chimney that is often wet. Belay. (4th class)    P5) Climb the chimney.

Solar Slab,105732257,Trad,105732007,5.6,1220,9,3.5,703.0,"Solar Slab is a very popular route due to its long length and all pitches are 5.6 or easier.  The climb is 9 pitches long and over 1200 feet in height.  However, the start of Solar Slab is on a huge terrace 500 feet up, which has a few different multi-pitch approaches.  Probably the most common ways to get to the base of Solar Slab are to climb Johnny Vegas (5.7, 4 pitches), or the Solar Slab Gully (5.3, 5 pitches).  An early start is highly recommended to beat the crowds, climb the 14 pitches, and make the lengthy descent.  A headlamp is also a good idea.    Start from the Oak Creek Canyon parking area, and follow the obvious trail for 45 minutes to an hour.  A prominent trail leads to an obvious gully to the right, the Solar Slab Gully.  Climb this or Johnny Vegas to the terrace 500 feet up.    P1) Wander up the beautiful featured golden slab for quite a ways to the start of a nice hand crack.  There is little pro in the slab, and the hardest move is gaining the crack system.  Follow the crack system to a ledge with a fixed 2-bolt anchor. (5.5)    P2) From the ledge, follow the sandy chimney left and up to another ledge to belay at. This is probably the worst pitch of the climb. (5.5)    P3) Wander up unprotected but well featured rock for about 20 feet to a finger crack.  Traverse right when obvious and follow a corner to a small belay ledge. (5.6)    P4) Climb a varnished left facing corner until possible to traverse right to a huge belay ledge with fixed anchors. (5.6)    P5) Climb the beautiful hand crack as long as desired, eventually sinking in a belay at the best spot possible.  Some bolts are found near the crack on this pitch. This is a 3 star pitch. (5.5)    P6) Finish up this crack, stepping left eventually and belaying at the top of a pillar.  I don't recommend trying to link this pitch with P5.  I don't think that even a 60 meter rope is long enough. (5.4)    P7) Wander up and right protecting in various features to get to a low angle crack.  Climb this crack up to an anchor.  Don't stop at this point, but remember where this anchor is if you are planning to rap the route.  Instead, traverse right a bit, then go up and easy corner to the huge low angle terrace. (5.3)    P8) Scramble up to a black varnished dihedral and sink a belay.  Depending on your comfort level, this pitch can be done unroped. (class 4)     P9) Climb the black dihedral until the angle kicks back and sink a belay. (5.5)    Descent:  I have only done the rappels, but there is also a walk off apparently.  This is supposed to be difficult and time consuming.  The rappels also take a lot of time, but it is a fairly straight forward way of getting off the rock.  Down climb to the right of the last pitch on easy slabs (3rd class) to get to a traverse around to the belay ledge used below the dihedral.  Then downclimb the 8th pitch and the last easy part of pitch 7 until the anchors mentioned.  From here, rap (double ropes, 200' better, maybe even necessary?).  Probably about 6 rappels gets you to the starting terrace.  Then rap either Johnny Vegas or Solar Slab Gully (another 5 rappels).  I recommend the gully, as Johnny Vegas is likely to get your rope stuck.    There is an entire chapter about this route in Red Rock Odyssey","{105951192: 4, 107159816: 4, 10393: 4, 107075029: 4, 10146: 4, 10232: 4, 10996: 4, 11561: 4, 106782341: 4, 107521823: 4, 11331: 4,

Probably lots of folks have looked up at it and thought, ""looks like a miserable gully slog-- no way it could be good.""  Surprise!    About 100 yards to the left of Beulah's Book is an indistinct buttress leading up to the left side of a huge roof.  The buttress is bordered on its left side by a brushy, unappealing gully.  Start at the very toe of this buttress.    Pitch 1: Pleasant face climbing leads up to a right-slanting crack.  Belay at its top.    Pitch 2: Step right and climb over a slight bulge, then face climb straight up staying near the junction of the white and dark rock.  Belay on a ledge to the left.  (Just left of this ledge is a rap station on a tree in the gully; one long rappel, down and west, reaches the ground near the start of Dubious Flirtations.)  Note also that there is an off route bolt a little to the right of the beginning of this pitch, presumably as part of a variation start.    Pitch 3: Step right and continue up a small dihedral. Belay at a small stance with shrubbery and a chimney above.    Pitch 4: Move up the dihedral past an annoying bush and into a featured squeeze chimney.  Climb this chimney to a wide clean gully and continue up to another wide gully/chimney to another stance by a large chockstone.    Pitch 5: Climb out of the gully onto the arete and face on the left side of the slot, then up and out onto slab.  Move up until reaching a ledge approximately even with the large Solar Slab Terrace.  (An easy traverse right at this point gives access to the Terrace and the routes continuing there.)    Pitch 6: Continue straight up the rounded buttress above on pleasant slab climbing.  A very long pitch (60m+?) leads to a good belay ledge at a pine tree.  (Alternatively, divide the pitch in two  by belaying at a varnished scoop.)    Pitch 7: Climb up and slightly right on even more pleasant slabs until reaching a large brushy ledge.    At this point you can scramble right (class 3) for 100 feet, passing the top of Going Nuts, and join Solar Slab two pitches above the terrace.  Alternatively, and more direct, continue up over broken rock (better on the right) and join Sunspot Ridge at The Notch.

Sunspot Ridge,105791012,Trad,105732007,5.8-,1500,12,2.3,21.0,"Red Rock isn't normally known for its ridge climbs, but this route has a good line, airy location, and even a gendarme or two.  The rock is good and the route is long-- a great combination!    To the left of Solar Slab, the base of the wall bends down, reaching the streambed a few hundred yards to the west.  The buttress that protrudes into the canyon continues upward as a blunt ridge separating the Solar Slab from the large wall containing Black Orpheus.  Sunspot Ridge climbs this feature.    On the left side of the southeast-facing buttress is a gully system.  Some bushwhacking leads to a belay alcove at its base.  Climb a pitch up the crack on the left wall of the gully and belay in a cavelike chimney/tunnel.  Move up and right, passing a small bulge.  Continue right and up the varnished face, protected by tricky wired nut placements.  Eventually move left and belay on a good ledge.  Climb up for about thirty feet to a small triangular ceiling, then traverse right until you reach a left-slanting crack.  Follow this crack to the Lower Shoulder.  This shoulder can also be reached by climbing Solar Flare or by complicated scrambling and easy climbing from the west.    From the large shoulder platform, scramble up on an easy pitch of mostly 4th-class climbing, staying slightly left, to a good belay niche near a bush.  The next pitch involves face-climbing straight up the knobby ridge crest above.  Another face-climbing pitch continues up the ridge, with limited protection, to some good ledges.  Two more fourth-class pitches lead up the ridge, passing a gendarme or two.  These pitches end at The Notch, a spacious and airy perch where the ridge merges into the main wall.  The improbable headwall above turns out to be beautiful 5.0 climbing on varnished plates.  Another pitch up one of the cracks above (both are about 5.7) leads to the ledges at the top Solar Slab's fifth or sixth pitch.  Either continue to the top and descend via the Painted Bowl, or rappel Solar Slab via the bolted rap stations.

A beautiful hike in a perfect canyon, a great natural line, and amazing positioning. Line Of Addiction is a fine route on a remote wall. The climbing is sustained and the rock is pretty much all good except for a few places. It has great protection at the cruxes but does have some runout sections on easier to moderate terrain. I don't know the history of this route or how, when, or who installed the bolts. But thanks for the hard work.

Really nice chickenwingin. About 30 feet up you'll start layin this puppy back for some beautiful climbing. Clip bolts for pro. Gain another anchor with another semi-hangin stance.     Pitch 3) 5.11a: Climb straigh left off the belay doing a move (5.10) to gain the perfect 4 inch crack in a right facing corner. Lay this back for about 40 feet until it turns to hands and you can milk a rest before finishing the pitch. Another anchor will be at a stance.    Pitch 4&5 can combine) 5.10c: Start climbing up and left off the belay and gain an arete (bolt) then go back right into the corner. Follow this past a two bolt anchor and keep goin up the corner. About twenty-five feet from your anchor this corner will pinch off to nothing and you'll bust out onto the face. Gain another anchor.    Pitch 6) 5.7: Climb up and left off the belay. No pro for about 60 feet. The climbing is easy but be careful for loose patina. Gain a nice sized ledge with an anchor.    Pitch 7) 5.11+: Climb straight up off the belay on some pretty crumby rock. You will start heading for a tiny seam left of an arete. You will be pretty far off you gear here. There is a crucial Yellow/Green Offset Alien placement in this seam that will give you the confidence to make your next sequence of moves. Climb out onto the arete leaving you with some really big exposure but rad moves (5.10ish). Climb up the arete on the right side aiming for the obvious overhanging corner.    Again you're gonna be pretty far off that Alien placement but the climbing isn't outrageous. Clip a bolt and depump. Start climbing up the beutiful corner using some weird stems and eventually gaining some beautiful fingerlocks in the corner. It gets steeper as you go but the locks and holds get better. This pitch is awesome. Gain a ledge and an anchor. If you've sent to here, it's in the bag.     Pitch 8) 5.6: Climb straigh up off the anchor heading up and left. Follow this aiming for a way out to your left until you come to a slabby wall with a few little moves and eventually gain a chimney. Climb the chimney until you get to a tree. Belay off the tree and when your partner gets to you, climb towards the summit behind you. Enjoy your beer and the view.","{14611: 4, 12486: 3, 10168: 2, 110248120: 0}"
Chicken Lips,105814367,Trad,105813928,5.10a/b,900,7,2.9,18.0,"Chicken Lips is a good route. It has friction, thin face, hand crack, layback, and chimney climbing spread over a logical line up a very cool piece of rock. However, it is solidly in the 'adventure-climb' category and will stay there until it gets re-bolted. If your experience on a climb is tarnished (or inflated) by poor protection and face climbing on hollow flakes, you may adjust the quality rating of this climb accordingly. There are a lot of bolts on this route, most of which are rusty 26 year-old 1/4""s. Occasionally, there is a 3/8"". Most hangers are the dubious SMC hangers, although there is the occasional ""JU"" homemade hanger for nifty historical context. Unfortunately, you can not rely on trad pro to bail you out in most bolted sections.    The route gets a lot of sun, as it is a similar south-facing aspect to the Eagle Wall. The upper couple pitches will be shady earlier as they are in a chimney system.    P1. Follow awful bolts up thin face and friction (can be very sandy!) to the ledge under the obvious left-facing dihedral. ~100' 5.10-    P2. Climb up the fun dihedral crack until it bottoms out and you can escape right to a broken section above a tree visible from the beginning of the pitch. Then head back and left to a belay in the right-facing corner. ~130' 5.10- (The Urioste guide mentions a 5.7 variation that escapes right from the belay and then goes up to the tree. However, the crux dihedral on this pitch is the only 5.10 climbing you'll do where the pro is good, so enjoy it!)    P3. Continue up the corner ramp-handcrack until you can see the crack bottom out above you. When it looks easiest, step left onto the varnished face of the corner, and then out onto the arete! A few bolts take you to a stance with two bolts. One is a 1/4"" rust-a-thon. The other is a 3/8"" spinner. SMC hangers, but no visible cracks. There is no real back-up pro, although I put a couple awful small nuts in sandy flares for the fun of it, and it's possible that a ballnut might be slightly more secure. But still awful. ~130' 5.8 (with a 70m, you could *probably* set up a trad belay in the main corner before the step left to the arete, and then link the remainder of this pitch and the pitch above, thereby avoiding the anchor.)    P4. Go straight up the arete, past many bolts, to a large ledge with an enormous pine tree. There is a little pro in horizontals to back-up the bolts. Generally, you step to the arete, or even reach around it, for the path of least resistance. A lot of the rock is delicate on this pitch. ~150'. 5.10-    P5. The clean varnished dihedral above you is the last 'hard' climbing on the route. Layback the entry moves, and clip (or don't clip!) the bad bolts. Good gear can be found in the back of the crack, if you are willing to peek around the corner. Continue up into a notch past easier (but mandatory runout) climbing to another stance. The Urioste guide says to belay at 120', but I liked the stance and the gear better at around 180', which is about 20' below a white overhang guarding the rest of the chimney system. ~180'. 5.9    P6. Continue up past one bolt and the slightly rotten overhang, and keep running it out on slabby sandy ramp-chimney to a stance. at least 100' (?) 5.7/5.8    P7. Keep going up. Eventually you will punch out into the sun on a little sandy 4th class with a big mostly-dead tree. For me, it was ~200' to the tree. This pitch is awkward 5.6 chimneying, or provocative face climbing outside the crack on delicate holds. From the tree, scramble a few hundred feet to the ridge crest.","{105873727: 4, 105951805: 4, 109605892: 4, 109858158: 4, 110795270: 3, 13297: 3, 105801659: 3, 105820266: 3, 12522: 3, 106415606: 3, 11591: 3, 106838734: 2, 107175878: 2, 10168: 2, 12698: 2, 105829653: 2, 111284682: 2}"

It is the easiest route up the aeolian wall and one of only a couple sub-5.10 routes that summits the mountain. It has a lot of fun and interesting climbing but has a few sections of extremely mossy rock that detract from the overall experience. Even still it is a worthy adventure that will clean up with traffic. P1- Head up easy face into a funky and mossy corner with a hand crack, possibly heady at times but the gear is there. Continue up the corner and turn left into the easy gully and continue up to a huge tree to belay. This is the ""approach pitch"" for the original route. 200' 5.9 P2- A short low 5th boulder problem leads to a 4th class scramble up to the base of the main wall. 60' 5- P3- Scramble up the ramp straight above and into a corner with a wide crack, funky stemming leads to some easy face to the base of a flare. 5.7+ 140' P4- Head straight up the strenuous flare (crux of the route), continuing straight up the featured wide crack and hand crack. Step right at some overlapping cracks, belay at a small ledge below a shallow corner. 100' 5.9+ P5- Straight up the crack a short ways, then step right into the corner. Stem up the corner to some chockstones, face climbing out left avoids the stones, continue straight up to a ledge next to a mossy wide crack. 100' 5.9 P6- THE MOSS PITCH; step right for some easy face climbing through the moss (5.6), then step back left into a short chimney, continue up the crack to a mossy roof (5.9+), a hand crack above leads to a creative stance below the next big roof (Dont worry most of the moss is done with after this pitch) 100' 5.9+ P7- THE BULGE; stem straight up, some commiting moves before your first piece, then pull the fun hand crack roof. A splitter hand crack above leads to a finger crack bulge that stems, continue up to a stance 30' below a big bush. 100' 5.9+ P8- step left and stem easily around a tree, continue up the corner past a ledge (optional belay here) to an uncomfortable belay up in the chimney. 150' 5.9 P9- Continue up the chimney eventually turning into face climbing around a wide crack, belay at a stance below a big gaping flare. 140' 5.8+ P10- Up a short ways and step right into a seam that runs the length of the flare, this is runout with funky gear and isn't the easiest climbing. Alternatively, chimney the flare at an unknown grade. Head past the bulge and continue up the chimney. Chimney up past where it turns to a squeeze and cram your way through a pretty tight hole below the giant chockstone above. 180' 5.9R P11- another rope stretcher. head up the squeeze chimney, a little runout but pretty secure. Chimney out and around a small chockstone (a horizontal directional keeps the rope away from it) and continue up the corner past a short OW, easy flaring chimney moves lead you up to one final roof. Belay at some giant boulders and a ledge. 200' 5.9 P12- Mostly easy scrambling. head to the left side of the gully to avoid the brush, a short and easy finger crack leads you up to the notch where inti watana tops out. 120' 5.7-  At this point you are below p15 of Resolution Arete as per the george bell topo (the same vicinity inti tops out)  P13-18 follow res arete to the top  Descent- The best decent off wilson is oak creek.

Gift of the Wind Gods,105818088,Trad,105732075,5.10,0,10,3.0,13.0,"Gift of the Wind Gods is an excellent climb: lots of pitches of fun, varied climbing on an improbable face far away from the crowds. When you look up at the wall from the base of the climb, my mind tricks me into thinking it is vertical to overhanging for the first six pitches. However, there is only really one steep bulge on the whole climb. The rest is a nifty face climb that links cracks and weaknesses to a ledge system beneath broken climbing to the summit of Wilson. It is a definite step up in difficulty/commitment from Inti Watana, but nothing like Resolution Arête.     The rock is generally quite good. The crux is real 5.10 for Red Rocks. However, you should be prepared for some less-than-perfect bolts near face climbing, and some serious feeling climbing on the lower grades. In my book, there is definitely some 5.8 R on this route, and depending on how you feel about the bolts, some dicey sections at higher grades too. There are no bad pitches on the route.    As of 4/22/06, the first pitch and a half get shade in the morning from the rock formation to the left of the route. The upper pitches go into the shade in the early afternoon around 1:30.    All belay stations except for the top two are bolted. Most pitches are 120-150', but I wasn't paying much attention to the lengths. See the Urioste supplement for estimates.    See Approach beta for P1. awkward 5.8ish.    P2: Traverse right (bolts) to a weakness. Follow this up to a station beneath a couple bushes. hard 5.9? easy 5.10?    P3: Head up, over bush, and step right to the other obvious crack and follow this to a station with a ton of bolts. 5.8ish    P4: Step left into another weakness, follow it up to the bolt-line above through a bulge (good bolts at crux) and another belay station. easy 5.10ish. feels like doing a pitch at the Gallery, except a thousand feet off the ground.    P5: shorter pitch. head up the crack to a station on the left. 5.8ish.    P6: another shorter pitch. follow bolts up, then step right and pull onto the belay ledge. 5.9ish. (There is a variation here heading up and left over a bulge past two visible bolts that looks like solid 5.11.)    P7: A full-value heads-up pitch. A technical traverse (1/4"" bolts, cool climbing) heads right, then up sustained face on more 1/4"" bolts (see protection notes). There is an off-route bolt about 15 up before where you traverse around the corner. 5.10.     P8: Short pitch with fun and squirmy wide climbing. Walk the #4 with you and place pro in the back of the crack. There are a couple bolts too. Pull past the juggy bulge to another station. 5.9ish    P9: links to P10 for one long easy 180 pitch to tree in easy broken terrain, or belay off a tree in the middle to break it up. 5.7 at the bottom, easier up top.    That's the climb, but it ain't over yet.. Unrope and scramble NW along a loose ledge system with trees and an excellent flat bivy spot under a headwall (heading towards headwaters of oak creek). While traversing, when you walk around corner, you find yourself in a big gully system that leads down to the main gully formed by the weakness between Cactus Flower Tower/Mt. Wilson, which then heads down W to Oak Creek.     Note: there are no good descent trails that I know of on Mt. Wilson. The descent described here is based on only one descent with a local. It works well, takes about three and a half hours from summit to car, but may not be the best way possible. Feel free to root around and post up. It is possible that the enormous gully heading NW between Cactus Flower and Wilson would get back to Oak Creek, and It would be a great shortcut if it worked.    To get to our descent, you need to get higher on Wilson to get your bearings and access the right ramp system. Head up, pretty much to the summit of Mt. Wilson. Follow this big broken gully (big pine trees up a ways) on 3rd  and 4th class to its top. There is one slippery sandy section that we roped up for, but you might be able to find an easier way. From the top of the gully, hike eastish to the summit of Wilson, then head W towards the distant grey limestone slopes.","{111359086: 4, 106441684: 4, 113142562: 4, 112413521: 4, 12698: 3, 111284682: 3, 108491912: 3, 106070195: 3, 7117535: 3, 12486: 2, 10168: 2, 107301514: 2, 10445: 2}"

It shares the first 6 pitches with gift of the wind gods to where that route traverses right. The line is aesthetic and the climbing is good, the bolting seems a bit botched making the route confusingly runout at times. Worth doing if you want more adventure than gift was dishing or if the line particularly calls to you.  P1-6 follow gift of the wind gods to the belay at the base of the 10d traverse pitch. You can link 5-6, and would not be able to link 6 into 7. P7 180’ 5.11 (or 5.9 A0) from the belay, downclimb left to the first of two bolts. The crux is a boulder problem above the second bolt. The rock here is super fragile and I could see someone ripping stuff off, while it wouldn’t change the grade much you could potentially hurt someone on gift. There is an ancient sling here that I’m guessing was put in place to assist in aiding. After the roof, climb a face slightly left to a bolt, then back right to a seam, follow this to a comfy ledge and wonder why the belay bolts aren’t here. Continue up the face to the right with 2 more bolts and a runout to a hanging belay on 2 bolts. P8 190’ 5.9 climb the face straight up to a bolt, then traverse easy but questionable rock to the left and up to another bolt. This is the last bolt on route. Trend back right to a crack, there was a fixed but here. Climb the crack until it widens and becomes bushy, then the face to the right up to a belay stance below a flaring OW. P9 170’ 5.8 climb the crack above past some bushes, then the obvious OW up to a sloping stance where you can see an obvious ledge with a tree on your right. Climb a funky flake reminiscent of the elephants trunk to this ledge.  From here you have two options, decent via the gift of the wind gods decent or continuing to the summit.

P1: 5.9 R (5.6x)   Climb pockets and slopers up the arete for about 15 meters, them move slightly right onto the face and continue on pockets. The climbing is about 5.8R and is X-rated at a lower standard (probably 5.6) at least without tricams or a lot of fiddling. We had only a light rack for Woman Of Mt Dreams on this route, so perhaps I could have taken more/better gear. A few decent threads and cams in holes were found that protected a significant amount of climbing, but there were certainly areas with groundfall potential. Move up to lower angle rock and finish on slopers at ~110 feet. You will belay at the base of a set of good cracks on trad gear.   P2: 5.10 R/X   CLimb up the cracks (5.10-) on good gear, staying mostly with the one on the left, although the one on the right provides holds as necessary to climb at the 5.9+/10- level. This is well-protected. Continue up the left crack to its end and climb the face above on sparse and questionable gear for some more considerable distance (5.10, R/X). A good set of nuts and small cams might make this R-rated only, but on the meager rack we had for the FA, the route was X-rated for sure.

This is a serious undertaking with maximum adventure value. Some loose rock is encountered. The overall nature of the route tends toward thin cracks and face climbing; little to no wide cracks are present. All belays are situated on comfortable ledges and the scenery is unreal.  Pitch 1 (5.10a, 150 feet): Climb a low-angle left-facing corner utilizing the left crack where it steepens. Cut right on hollow rock and suspect pro to bypass the roof. Belay on the good ledge.  Pitch 2 (5.10a, 80 feet): Traverse left across the blank slab (photo op!) into a right-leaning crack which leads to a good belay ledge. Soft rock in the upper section makes this a challenging and heady lead.  Pitch 3 (5.7, 100 feet): Move up and left on stacked blocks. Head up the right-leaning ramp, but only for about 30 feet. Look left for an airy perch which is accessed by a discreet traverse and short boulder problem. Belay on the left side of the perch.  Pitch 4 (5.8, 110 feet): Awesome pitch! Make a wild jug traverse left to the edge of the arete. Head straight up the arete on varnished plates and discontinuous cracks.  Pitch 5 (5.8, 210 feet): Head up and left onto the airy arete. Bust a move over the small prow and chug all the way up the slabby ramp to a good ledge belay.  Pitch 6 (5.8, 150 feet): Head straight up on unpleasant flakes, then traverse right past a tree. Continue up the fun ramp to a cool alcove belay below the final crux section.  Pitch 7 (5.9, 150 feet): Jam the burly, mossy, right-leaning handcrack. Continue up easy terrain past a large pine tree to a belay among scrub oak.  Pitch 8 (4th class, 250 feet): Continue up the termination of the ramp as it meets a prominent notch in the summit ridge.  Summit scramble: Head left (south) along the ridge and scramble 3rd class to the south summit of Mount Wilson.  Descent: about 3 hours.

The low pitch count belies the adventurous nature of the route; an involved approach and sustained climbing make for a rewarding endeavor. The route has excellent climbing throughout, though the middle two pitches lack the high quality rock of the first and last pitches. It enjoys morning sun even in the dead of winter.    P1 (5.11b, 180’): Start on the right edge of the Outlaw Wall below a long, left-facing corner. Tricky climbing past two bolts leads to a tips crack in the corner that quickly widens. Layback and jam your way through 40-45 feet of fingers and off-fingers to a good rest. An enjoyable wide section takes you to an anchor at a stance.

Trial & Terror goes up a right diagonally running crack system to above a prominent roof and then follows weaknesses back and up to the top.  No bolts or drills were taken on the first ascent of the route so all anchors are natural and several pitches are longer than 200ft.  In addition to its lengthy and tedious approach, long pitches, and natural anchors, the route has several sections of delicate face climbing with decent run-outs.  While the moves are seldom that difficult the nature of climbing, remoteness, lack of retreat options, lengths of approach and descent make this a serious route.  The climbing is varied from incipient cracks to angling chimneys to fantastic face and crack climbing.  Overall, a fun route.    Pitch 1:  230ft, 5.9   Begin at the far left (south) side of the wall on a small tongue of white rock just left of an offwidth crack.  Climb up past a bush and through some interesting and sparsely protected climbing.  Continue up the crack until reaching a stance in the corner.

P17- 170' 5.9 Climb the hand crack up to some bushes that block the crack. Climb the face on the left placing gear in the bushes as needed. Continue up into the deep varnished chimney. 5.7 R Chimney leads up to a well protected cool mantle to a large blocky belay ledge. P18- 195' 5.9+ Start up the left facing corner past some choss blocks to a ledge. Climb halfway up the left side of a micro tower (Gummy Bear Tower). An unprotected (5.5) Leftward Face traverse leads you to the attractive right facing corner. Follow this past a very awkward OW/squeeze move to the top of the tower. P19- 170' 5.11- PG-13 ""The Headwall"" Amazing position and movement. Climb the seam following fixed gear. This pitch  is serious and sustained with some runouts in 5.10 terrain. Cruxes are reasonably well protected, imagine a 5.11 version of the rock warrior. Belay at a small ledge below a roof, only takes 2's and 3's. P20- 110' 5.9 R Steep climbing straight up leads to a roof with a crack above it. Once established on the face, climb straight up confusing overlaps and seams to the summit. Belay on a ledge at the lip of the summit or at a tree far from the edge.  Descent: The best descent off wilson is oak creek. When you top out turn right and walk across the summit ridge to the true summit, follow cairns from here.  Bail Options: There are a few retreat options that I am aware of, I am more familiar with some than others. The first would be to descend after climbing the apron. After lowering into Willie's you can descend this gully, I have not been in the upper part of this and cannot speak to it. A better option may be to climb the 5.8 slab (Pitch 10) and traverse a ledge system here to sherwood forest. The scramble between pitch 13 and 14 appears to be part of some sort of scramble that leads down to the base of LWC. Above the Kraken you will likely have to leave gear to rappel. The bolts at the top of pitch 15 seem like they would be a 70M or so rappel to sherwood forrest, this is untested. There is still tat in place from where we bailed on our first attempt. From the top of pitch 17, a 60M rappel leads down the face to a ledge with a small tree. A 65M rappel from here leads down to sherwood forest.","{108177328: 3, 108766469: 3, 112212034: 3}"

Proceed up into the large gully and aim for the first recess on the right. Pink Tornado Left starts on the main wall that is behind the right side of a 200 foot tall white triangular flake.    Once on the Sherwood Forest ledges you can rappel Dogma with a single 70m rope. Or you can climb another route (ie., Gwondonna Land Boogie or Scotty) up to summit Mount Wilson. This would make for a climb with one of the greatest elevation gains in the park.    From the base of the route it is unnecessary to hike back up to the White Rot Gully. Walk down to the lowest point of the Aeolian Wall gully where further progress is cliffed out by waterfalls. Two rappels with a single 60m rope get you down. This is much easier than downclimbing the White Rot.","{11591: 4, 108032974: 3, 111434815: 3, 111757042: 3, 108491912: 3, 105912797: 3, 112212034: 3, 106116385: 3, 105820266: 3, 107159816: 2, 108226968: 2, 105829653: 2, 107062556: 2, 105805486: 2}"

It was climbed in 1970 by John Williamson and Keith Hogan using a variation that ascended Willie's Couloir, then cut back right for upper headwall.  The adventurous teenagers spent three days on the route.  Local master Joe Herbst (who did not know Williamson and was unaware of his climb) climbed the route solo the following year on the day before his wedding.  Joe considers the route a milestone that marked the beginning of ""serious"" climbing in Red Rock.  This is an old-time adventure route and deserves an old-time adventurous description:    Climb a gully to the right side of Sherwood Forest.

The line rambles a bit near the top, but overall it follows a single weakness with virtually no traversing and therefore it presents minimal routefinding decisions. The difficulty stays comfortably below 5.10 except for the short awful roof crux on Pitch 7. This is a worthwhile moderate adventure with a spectacular summit and a truly one-of-a-kind descent.  What follows is simply the route description. Background info has its own dedicated section.   Pitch 1 (5.8 PG-13, 80 feet): Climb a trough into a groove with a poorly protected crux near the top. --- FRA: Saulnier/Custer (see Background Info)   Pitch 2 (5.7, 60 feet): Admission pitch. Squeeze past the tree into a flared offwidth, then cinch up your chalkbag and tunnel through dense chaparral to a belay at the base of an obvious thin crack. --- FRA: unknown (see Background Info)   Pitch 3 (5.9, 100 feet): Climb the engaging thin crack (crux protects with micro gear) which widens into a varnished handcrack highway after ~30 feet. Make a gear belay where the crack jogs left.   Pitch 4 (5.7, 100 feet): Follow the crack as it slices diagonally left and then up through absolutely gorgeous pink zebra stone. Belay in the comfy ""living room"" atop the pillar.   Pitch 5 (5.8, 80 feet): Climb the thin crack as it doglegs right and then back left to a pedestal on the broad arete. Here is where the route transitions from the south face onto the west face. On the left side of the pedestal is a pre-existing two-bolt anchor (see Background Info).   Pitch 6 (5.8, 80 feet): Continue along the left leaning ramp to a steep(er) handcrack finish. Belay on the big scenic ledge below an intimidating roof crack. --- FRA: unknown (see Background Info)   Pitch 7 (5.10d, 90 feet): The Sedona Vortex Pitch. Dig deep to conquer the heinous roof crack (tip: stick to jams and underclings; don't bother touching any of the garbage outside the crack). Continue up the funky handcrack into a crazy alcove. Exit the alcove and continue up the handcrack to a big ledge with a live tree.   Pitch 8 (4th class, 100 feet): Walk straight through the cool corridor and scramble up a series of ledges to a belay at the base of the Red Pinnacle.   Pitch 9 (5.2, 100 feet): Climb up left onto the south-facing rippled slab of the Red Pinnacle with one or two marginal placements in incipient cracks along the way. From the top, descend straight down the other side into a jungle gully (passing an old fallen ammo-can summit-log) and belay below an obvious pink handcrack.   Pitch 10 (5.8 PG-13, 90 feet): Jam the pink handcrack up into a varnished chimney, moving right along a horizontal shelf to a stance below a smooth varnished face. Place some marginal gear (or don't bother) and commit to an impeccable crimp ladder leading up to a spacious belay ledge.   Pitch 11 (5.8, 160 feet): Climb the obvious thin crack and continue up easy slabs toward the summit pyramid (optional belay if overcome by rope drag). Surmount the final block via an easy left-leaning handcrack on its left side.   Descent: Scramble down the deep couloir/gully on the northeast side of the spire.

Pitch 4 goes straight up the corner and exits right to a small belay perch even with the big overhangs.  Pitch 5 does not continue up the crack, but instead makes a few improbable, but easy, steps left to gain a finger crack directly above the overhang.  Continue up the rib, locating belays when suitable anchor options are available.  The route finishes up the clean hand crack in a small, right-facing dihedral.  (This is the same finish as Sunset Slab, which has joined this route from the left.)    Although the climbing on this route is rarely more difficult than 5.2, it still maintains a good level of interest.  Protection options on the slab are limited, routefinding is important, and belay sites must be chosen with care.  Beyond that, the route is fairly long for a beginning climber,  and retreat would require leaving gear.","{109340087: 4, 108327867: 4, 108779730: 4, 107151611: 4, 112383380: 4, 10996: 4, 105822976: 4, 105888900: 4, 105789175: 4, 12463: 4, 105990845: 4, 105808669: 4, 107022803: 4, 110362807: 3, 108310475: 3, 200148664: 3, 111103926: 3, 108118179: 3, 106709846: 3, 107495468: 3, 108195060: 3, 112374839: 3, 111821616: 3, 200068094: 3, 109218536: 3, 110682222: 3, 106089213: 3, 200196903: 3, 200180573: 3, 108225547: 3, 110536605: 3, 112035468: 3, 200282308: 3, 112430708: 3, 112514908: 3, 108149490: 3, 200396867: 3, 106797746: 3, 112512800: 3, 109373073: 3, 110726946: 3, 200066638: 3, 106722287: 3, 10481: 3, 106095990: 3, 107475383: 3, 105960717: 3, 13658: 3, 106384459: 3, 106596992: 3, 108317371: 3, 106554608: 3, 107301514: 3, 12988: 3, 106387327: 3, 106041605: 3, 108177328: 3, 105805486: 3, 111757042: 3, 105951192: 3, 110152429: 3, 106186024: 3, 107623049: 3, 106284991: 3, 107405626: 3, 14098: 2, 110298630: 2, 112507024: 2, 11591: 2, 200124616: 2, 106260474: 2, 105795302: 2, 111781125: 2, 106912387: 2, 110831889: 2, 108207349: 2, 110777198: 2, 111938041: 2, 107652586: 2, 10168: 2, 108353233: 2, 106164679: 2, 106916634: 2, 200427831: 2, 106081147: 1, 105805388: 1, 200444328: 1, 106536240: 1, 105886712: 1, 109531604: 1, 11802: 0}"

The most notable is the shamrock roof pitch which goes out a huge roof.  The pitches above the roof in the groove have similar rock and climbing feel as the wide pitches on Crimson Chrysalis minus the bolts.  There are no bolts or fixed anchors on the route.  The time to climb the route itself is probably an average grade III but with over 1000ft of approach pitches and a very involved descent you will probably be getting a grade V type of effort.      The R rating comes from the wide upper pitches which may be mitigated with wide gear.  Anywhere the climbing is difficult the protection is good.

It is easy climbing but pro is sparse.  Combining this with any of the lower slab routes would make for a big grade IV day.    There are no bolts on this climb but belays are generally good and easy to get.  This is probably the easiest way to get up the labyrinth wall.  As with any new route however, be aware that all holds may not be bomber.  I give the route 3 stars because of its position, length, and a few really neat pitches.

Start at an easy slab directly below this corner, and climb to a good ledge with a large bush on it.  You could probably bypass this pitch with scrambling around to the left, but the climbing here provides a pleasant warmup.  Pitch 2 goes up the clean corner above.  Use care when passing the perched block.  We were all too timid to touch it, so it might be more secure than it looks; however, the costs of being wrong about this are likely to be extreme.  Above the block, continue up the corner on perfect hand jams, and belay at a semi-hanging stance when the crack ends (small, finger-size cams).  Pitch 3 continues up the improbable face with surprisingly adequate protection in intermittent cracks (more finger-size cams and wires).    Pitch 4 follows easier cracks to a smooth, flared chimney.  An odd exit move to the right allows you to avoid the ominous convergence at the top of the chimney.  Continue up the water-polished rock to a belay alcove just right of a not-quite-thriving bush.  The next pitch starts by climbing back into the crack and going up the smooth, left-arching chimney above the bush.  When the arch ends, climb the long, right-facing dihedral, which begins as a hand crack but soon widens to offwidth size.  If you have wisely retained a large cam, this upper crack can even be protected.  The sixth pitch starts with a few fifth-class moves, but the climbing quickly becomes easier as the angle leans back and the rock becomes more broken.  Another hundred or two feet of fourth class take you to the top of the buttress.  This is also the spot where Kick in the Balls tops out.    Descent: The obvious descent is to rappel into the gully immediately west of the buttress.  Two or three rappels (they can be done with one  60-meter rope) bring you to easy ground.  This is a gully you will have visited as part of the approach if you have climbed Kick in the Balls.  Scramble down for 50 or so yards until you can exit to skier's left (west), and downclimb easy rock to the notch at the top of the Lotta Balls Wall.  Be aware that the last moves to the notch are a traverse straight west on frictiony ledges and NOT down the steep dropoff.  I vaguely recall having once descended to the east from the top of buttress, but my mostly suppressed memories seem to center on a frighteningly loose chimney that I have minimal interest in re-engaging.  If you go that way, it becomes more civilized once you reach the wide slabby area.  This is descended with some downclimbing and a rappel or two.","{112074286: 4, 108405147: 4, 107970005: 4, 105947818: 3, 108977895: 3, 111284682: 3, 106974860: 3, 108813207: 3, 200068094: 3, 111214144: 3, 112418846: 3, 200103187: 3, 112283276: 3, 110901369: 3, 112103546: 3, 107540375: 3, 110931186: 3, 109485255: 3, 108259749: 3, 105886121: 3, 105822976: 3, 111746759: 3, 13698: 3, 13965: 3, 12988: 3, 106095990: 3, 105886712: 3, 12463: 3, 111744573: 2, 15093: 2, 200097777: 2, 107652586: 2, 105871395: 2, 107390765: 2, 200070835: 2, 110390587: 2, 107325508: 2, 106434221: 2, 108362942: 2, 107542855: 1, 105892608: 1}"
Freaker's Ball,106177181,Trad,105732015,5.8,500,4,1.0,1.0,"From  the start of Dodgeball, scramble up a hundred or two feet of third class to a belay at the base of the main corner.  Rope up here.  The corner immediately becomes an interesting, smooth squeeze chimney.  Shortly above the chimney, the main corner branches, with a smaller, subsidiary corner splitting off to the left.  Pull over a small bulge and climb the left-facing corner to a small stance at its top.    Continue up the corner system with much questionable rock.  Above a short offwidth section, the crack ends beneath a towering fin of rock.  The faint of heart or strong of mind might take this opportunity to step right and continue up the right-facing corner near the top of Dodgeball. The alternative is face climbing directly above on the runout slab.  This would be a thought-provoking lead even if the rock were solid and the lichen absent.  In light of the actual conditions, the lead is positively engrossing.  Above the fin, climb up and right on easy terrain to the top of the buttress. Descend as for Dodgeball.",{12463: 1}

Lost Marbles,105732875,Trad,105732015,5.9,400,4,0.3,3.0,"The route climbs the face just to the left of Lotta Balls.  The second pitch involves a serious runout, with 5.9 climbing on questionable rock.    Pitch 1: climb into the initial dihedral of Lotta Balls.  However, do not follow the flake out right, but rather continue straight up the corner.  The climbing becomes progressively more difficult as the crack turns into a hairline seam.  Use your best thin-crack protection skills (as well as a Number 1 Camalot) until the crack ends on a blank face.  At this point a delicate step to the right allows you to clip the top protection bolt on the second pitch of Lotta Balls.  Continue up a short distance and set up a gear belay at the base of the dihedral.  A variation (due to Josh Thompson) avoids the bolt by means of runout 5.10+ face climbing up and slightly left from the end of the seam.    Pitch 2: Step left and climb the steep face (5.9R) straight up over fragile rock.  Protection is essentially non-existent for the first 40 feet.  Above this point, the difficulties ease and a wide crack leads to the spacious second belay ledge of Lotta Balls.    Pitch 3: Step left from the belay ledge onto the sweeping slab to the left of Lotta Balls.  Aesthetic, moderate friction climbing without much significant protection leads up the middle of the slab and eventually joins the crack on the right.    Pitch 4: Easy climbing leads to the top.    Descend left with a couple of short rappels.  The serious nature of the second pitch may limit its popularity, but the first and third pitches are quite good and could be combined with the Lotta Balls dihedral for a much more relaxed climb.","{12463: 1, 10445: 0}"

Do the 45 minute approach to the Lotta Balls wall from the First Creek Trailhead.    P1) Climb up horizontal crack features on the huge leaning boulder.  Once on top of the boulder, climb the left facing corner and up a flake system to a fixed anchor on a small ledge (bolted anchor).  (5.6)    P2) Climb up the namesake section of the rock.  There is no crack here, only a lotta balls. Two bolts are in place for protection.  Pinch and edge on the really cool ball shaped holds for about 25 feet.  This section can be a bit spicy.  Then follow a corner to a large ledge. (5.8)    P3) Climb up the corner above the ledge, then traverse left and climb a crack to the top.  This pitch is a full rope length.

Follow P2+3 of Bruja's to the top-more demanding climbing and trickier pro, as well as a large traverse that can cause massive drag if not efficiently engineered, make the upper 2/3 more serious and challenging than might be apparent until in the thick of things.

American Flesh Dance (Combination of The Flesh plus American Ghost Dance),107149327,Trad,105732162,5.10,800,5,2.0,1.0,"Description general:   This route is an amalgam of two older routes on Black Velvet wall combined into a less difficult line. The route described here avoids the first 5.12 a pitch of American Ghostdance and combines the easier pitches of both routes into a more moderate grade of 5.10b/c. The route offers an alternate to the extremely crowded routes directly to the right (Prince of Darkness, Dreams of Wild Turkeys).  The upper pitch (s) of the route are bold but not in the league of boldness of Rock Warrior.    Pitch description:    Pitch 1  5.9 130 feet: Climb the first pitch of Refried brains to the chains  a beautiful crack line. At the top of this pitch either belay or continue up the next pitch to its belay.   Pitch 2  5.10a/b 70 feet: Step right under the small roof and turn it on the right. Climb the crack and face past a bolt to a curving ledge. Put in your own belay here with some small to medium camming units.   Pitch 3  5.10a/b 180 feet: Move to the right, place gear in the small left facing corner then move easily across the face to the right to join the second pitch of American Ghostdance at the 3rd bolt. Clip the bolt, climb the thin varnish (crux) to another bolt then go straight up on easier terrain with natural protection past a few small plants all the way to the big ledge to the right of the large right facing corner. No established belay exists here so you will need to build your own.   Pitch 4  5.10 120 feet: From the ledge you can see a bolt about 30 feet up and slightly right  climb carefully but easily to this bolt.  Follow the well spaced bolt line that curves out right then back left to the belay passing a total of 5 (6?) bolts. No natural gear is available except a wire near the first bolt. This is classic, exposed, spicy Black Velvet Wall climbing. Unfortunately all the bolts are rusty ¼ inch original gear. The belay is also old bolts that we backed up with two good wired stoppers.   Pitch 5 etc Appears to be more of the same as pitch 4. (We chose to climb left into Refried brains so we could rappel safely.) ",{105829653: 2}

Approach it by scrambling up along the base of the wall, past the start of Refried Brains and a large boulder and a smaller boulder leaning against the wall.  Begin on a two foot high pedestal at the base of a perfect finger crack in a corner.    Climb up via perfect locks to a ledge and no-hands rest.  Place some small gear here (a blue and red Alien are perfect), then begin the very long, very pumpy rising hand traverse.  Initially climb up to a good stance at a large pod that accepts a #3 Camalot, then continue hand traversing to another slot that accepts bomber finger sized gear, and finally punch it past three widely-spaced bolts to the anchor.

Dream of Wild Turkeys,105732275,Trad,105732162,5.10a,700,7,3.6,586.0,"This is one of my favorite climbs in Red Rocks. It is varied, steep, long and challenging with perfect rock. This route has some great crack climbing but the real excitement comes from the reasonably bolted face sections. The exposure is fantastic and the whole route is well protected.  History: A ""Turkey"" was a name given to someone who did not conform to the purist climbing standards, see in dictionary under ""Kook."" Jorge and Joanne politely responded to their given titles by self-professing and naming the route ""Dream of Wild Turkeys.""  DOWT is deservedly very popular and given the fact that it shares the first pitch with the equally popular Prince of Darkness (5.10c), an early start is highly recommended.  There are many other options on this wall and in this area if this route is jammed. Sour Mash is another good option on BV Wall and a few variations of DOTW exist also: Yellow Brick Road is a 5.10b 2-pitch direct variation beginning on the third pitch, and The Gobbler is a 5.10a variation to the start.  To approach, follow the stream bed until a large wall blocks the way. Here, you should be directly across from the large arch on the lower right side of the wall. At this point, follow a faint ""trail"" up left to fourth class terrain and scramble up this, aiming for the left side of the arch. Take the trail to a rocky terrace on the left of the arch. Locate a nice right angling crack about a pitch up. The bottom of this crack is the top of the first pitch.  P1: Climb nebulous 5.6 terrain aiming for the bottom of the crack on P2. Belay at 2 bolts about 100' up. The pro on this pitch is somewhat sparse but the climbing is easier than anything else on the route.  P2: 5.9, ~160' Make a few thin moves off the belay up and right and gain the crack. There are lots of slabular moves on this pitch due to the angling nature. The crack eats stoppers. Follow this crack to another double-bolt belay.  P3: 5.9, 100' Continue up the crack until a line of bolts leads to the right. Continuing straight up puts you on Yellow Brick Road. Check out the plaque. Make the exciting traverse right clipping 4 or 5 bolts on your way. This is steep here but the holds are big. Once you gain the large crack, make some 5.8 offwidth moves up another 30' to another 2 bolt belay on your right. If you miss the belay, which is hard to spot, another possible, albeit uncomfortable, belay can be had a little further up.  P4: 5.10a, 150' Continue up the crack to it's top. The crack becomes thinner and thinner until it's gone. At the top, two strangely placed bolts mark the crux of the pitch and the climb. Make a few very thin moves out left aiming for the bolted belay.  P5: 5.10a, 50' Exciting pitch! Follow the line of bolts up and left on tiny edges and belay at another set of bolts at the base of a cresent shaped corner.  P6: 5.9, 130' Follow the cresent corner up and right. It starts out shallow and easy and gets steeper and harder near its top. Step onto the face and make some bolt-protected moves up and left to a thin crack. Follow this bolted crack up to another bolted belay.  P7: 5.8, 120' Follow the thin crack straight up. Near the top, the angle rolls off and easy climbing leads to a large ledge with belay/rap bolts.  Most people rap from here as we did, although the route continues up for another 4 pitches which are suppose to be good.  For the descent from here, make a series of double-rope raps down the wall. Staying a little left on POD is the best option if noone is coming up as there are fewer rope-eating cracks there, although rapping down DOWT and Yellow Brick Road works fine too. We did it in 5 raps.","{10270: 4, 10515: 4, 10146: 4, 11926: 4, 10510: 4, 106736701: 4, 106829444: 4, 106622079: 4, 11591: 4, 10788: 4, 106257523: 4, 107488582: 4, 13965: 4, 106122624: 4, 106919775:

Epinephrine,105732422,Trad,105732162,5.9,1600,13,3.9,1088.0,"This is it. THE classic red rocks route. And it's just as good as everyone says it is.  Approach as for the Black Velvet wall. After climbing around the chockstone, return to the stream bed and walk another minute or two upstream. The bolts on the first pitch will be easily spotted on the left.  This route has lost some of the original seriousness now that bolted anchors have been placed all the way up. This speeds things up considerably and provides an easy retreat if needed. You'll need two ropes if you intend to rap the route.  The original description had 18 pitches. If you use the bolted belay anchors you can climb Epinephrine in 11 or 12 pitches. This description will assume that you use the bolted belays. It's hard to remember precisely how long (or how many!) pitches are on this route but I'll do my best.  Pitch 1: climb out of the creekbed past bolts to a big ledge (5.8). Continue on past a couple more bolts to a bushy ledge. (165 feet, 5.8)  Pitch 2: work up and left into a chimney, then pull out the right side and work up easier rock to the base of the big chimney that forms the right side of the Black Tower.(165 feet?, 5.7). May need some rope stretch here.  Pitch 3: The main event: chimney up a wide crack with good pro to a ledge on the right wall with bolts. (140', 5.9)  Pitch 4: Chimney up and swing left as the crack narrows. Climb easier rock to a good ledge. Belay or continue on up into a narrower chimney with a fixed nut at the base and then two bolts. The bolts can be hard to spot - you need to work away from the back of the chimney to find them. If you have enough rope you can belay at the top of the Black Tower. Otherwise belay at the top of the chimney and do a short easy pitch to the tower's top. You can avoid the lower part of the chimney on the right. (165', 5.9)  Pitch 5: Climb the face above the top of the tower, passing an overhang, aiming at a brushy ledge. (150', 5.8)  Pitch 6: Traverse easily right to the Elephant's Trunk. Ascend this to a ledge at its top. (80', 5.6)  Pitch 7: Climb up the crack system (some bolts) to a bolted belay at a ledge. (90', 5.8+) (can be combined with Pitch 6). The rap route goes straight down from here, avoiding pitches 5 and 6.  Pitches 8 - 10: Continue up the same crack system, stopping at the bolted belays. A short traverse right (bolt) is found on pitch 10 before an easy roof (good gear, use jugs left of crack). (400', 5.8+)  Pitch 11: Either rap the route of continue to the top of the crack. There is no rap anchor at the top of the pitch, though you'll see some bolts with missing hangers where there used to be an anchor. You can use a full 70m rope (and maybe some  simul climbing) to get to the bolts at the top of the first 4th class section (see route exit below).  Route exit: You've finished the 5th class climbing, but you're not done yet. There is about 600 feet of 4th class/5.2 slab that you need to climb. If you feel bold, you may choose to unrope and free-solo, or you and your partner can simulclimb the rest of the way up. Otherwise, you can build anchors and place a little gear as you go.  Follow the right leaning ramp all the way to the very top. It ends just after turning into a very well defined right-facing dihedral, where you might find yourself mantling on the face behind you as you climb. If you are doing this part of the climb at night, you'll want to keep an eye out for an ""exit"" to the right, after passing through the dihedral section. You'll arrive at a large ledge at the top of the dihedral. If you try to keep going straight up, you'll encounter a 12 foot sandy/sometimes-wet ""wall"". Don't climb that wall.  You'll step right 30 feet, and make a few moves to turn a corner.  Keep in mind that for this entire ramp section, you'll not be able to see the famous pine tree or 4th class exit-pitch. Just keep trending up and right.  Once you round the corner, you'll come to a very large sandy ledge protected by a roof. Proceed along the ledge, take the rightward facing ramp that's plainly visible ahead, and congratulate you and your partner for a job well done.  Descent: follow cairns along the ridge leading east from the summit. There are a lot of cairns - if you miss them backtrack until you get back on the right trail. The route will eventually drop left towards Whiskey Peak at the top of Frogland.  Logistics: Getting a pack through the chimney pitches is a pain - go light and bring a long sling to trail the pack when needed. The route gets almost no sun so you can go fairly light on water. Get an early start and move fast! Most of the climbing is 5.7 - 5.8. If you can avoid wasting time at the belays you should be able to get up in a day without too much effort. A competent party can easily get up in 8 hours. Figure on about 1 - 1.5 hours in descent. Don't leave gear at the base of the route if you chose to walk down - it's a long way out of the way to go back there.  If the chimney pitches were in Yosemite they would be 5.7. This isn't Steck-Salathe! 5.9 is consistent with other Vegas ratings though.  Here's the step by step descent by Jon P (thanks!)  1. Head up to the summit of Black Velvet peak by rounding the big lone pine tree at the top of the route and scrambling which quickly eases into hiking. Enjoy the view of Vegas.  2. When looking out at Las Vegas from Black Velvet peak, turn to face your 4:00 (right and slightly behind you), seeing another very large peak connected by a ridge and saddle. Follow this ridge, dropping down the saddle, and make your way up to the top of the large peak.  3. Once at the summit of the 2nd tall peak, look to your 8:00 (left and slightly behind) to see another ridge heading toward hwy 160.  4. Scramble down the large peak to obtain this next ridge. Stay as high as safely possible as you follow the ridge which is sporadically marked with cairns.  5. Connect the dots along the ridge, hitting 3 or 4 more peaks as you follow the ridge. Only one of the peaks does not have a cairn on it but continue high on the ridge heading to the top of each peak.  6. You'll know when you are at the final peak because it has 4 or 5 very stout cairns on it closely spaced. It is obvious! If you are unsure then you are not there yet!  7. Once on top of the peak with the 4 or 5 big cairns, head left and down following the many cairns along the way. If you head down and do not see cairns, you are going the wrong way.  8. Get dumped into the whisky peak gully decent (turn right when you come to the fork) and continue down behind Frogland, following trails and cairns which are heading in the direction of hwy 160. There are multiple trails going down this decent and they all seem to meet up eventually.  9. Upon exiting the gully, curve around whisky peak following the trail that curves left.  10. The decent trail back to the parking lot is several hundred feet before Frogland, marked with a large cairn sitting on top of a large boulder.","{105926739: 4, 106247496: 4, 106766014: 4, 11926: 4,

Fiddler on the Roof,105732248,Trad,105732162,5.10+,500,7,3.6,158.0,"This fine route climbs up and along the lip of a huge roof on the right side of Black Velvet wall.  Sustained climbing on excellent varnish.  Every pitch is classic.    P1) 5.9.  Start at some scoopy dishes 50' right of Prince of Darkness.  Climb up past 3 bolts, then traverse right along horizontal features past 2 more bolts.  Very nice rock and moves.  A couple cams can be used in an easy crack at the top of the pitch.  Bolted rap anchor.    P2) 5.9.  Climb a low angle crack into a chimney.  Good rock, bolted rap anchor.  This pitch is 60' or so and ends on a small but flat ledge.  (These first two pitches are shared with The Gobbler.)    P3) 5.10- PG.  Climb up to a bolt, then traverse right around a small right facing dihedral.  Clip another bolt and continue right.  There may be another bolt on this pitch (memory lapse), but at any rate, there are good gear placements.  You basically traverse right along the lip of the huge roof on positive holds.  It is exciting for both leader and follower, but not dangerous.  If you fell though, you could go over the roof and would need to climb the rope to get back on.  This pitch is 120' or so and ends at a bolted anchor.  Sweet.    P4) 5.10+.  The crux pitch climbs straight up on immaculate varnish.  There are two bolts low on the pitch, which can be supplemented by wires and TCUs.  The first crux is a little further on and is protected by thin gear.  There is also a tricky move up higher at the third and final bolt.  Another classic pitch. 150' to hanging belay with rap anchor.    P5) 5.10.  This pitch climbs straight up past bolts.

To locate this route, start at the base of the shared start of 'Prince Of Darkness' & 'Dream Of Wild Turkeys'. Walk to the right 40' and look up a line of two bolts in light-colored rock.    P1: (5.9, 100') Climb up and past these two bolts, then go sharply right for some distance until below another 2 bolts, and ultimately below a hanging, white, acute dihedral/chimney, overhead. Climb up past those bolts to a good ledge at the bottom of the chimney/dihedral.     P2: (5.10a, 70') Climb up into the right-leaning corner and slot, making your way up slowly on trad gear and passing one bolt on the way to a ledge at the top. I remember placing a thin nut or two somewhere on this pitch. Belay at the ledge on a fixed anchor, or clip it and continue on P3. This is also the departing point for Fiddler on the Roof, which climbs out on the face to the right, above the huge roof now just at your right.    P3: (5.9, 60') Climb up the steep face on big holds to the fixed anchors as for the 3rd pitch of Dream of Wild Turkeys.    To descend, rap to the anchor on P2, then do a long double-rope rap to the ground from there. 60M ropes may be necessary for this descent, but I am not sure. This will prevent the rock from 'gobbling' your rope on the way down and is also one of the most exposed raps you may ever do, under the belly of Fiddler On the Roof.","{12075: 4, 13513: 4, 106554608: 4, 106919775: 4, 11048: 4, 106684182: 4, 15023: 4, 106070195: 4, 106411080: 4, 107537378: 4, 106697740: 4, 107326021: 4, 106314797: 4, 106860947: 4, 106736701: 4, 105805486: 4, 105942841: 4, 107545719: 4, 110745231: 4, 105896324: 4, 106506554: 4, 107226876: 4, 107600470: 4, 107774848: 4, 111757042: 4, 111904475: 4, 111686019: 4, 108092503: 4, 108751329: 4, 111214144: 4, 107497265: 4, 112228015: 4, 200118368: 4, 108101871: 4, 110457315: 4, 200357245: 4, 106596992: 4, 108746269: 4, 111700011: 4, 110529846: 4, 200070835: 4, 200219962: 4, 106077459: 4, 10232: 3, 11591: 3, 10168: 3, 106116385: 3, 10185: 3, 105815147: 3, 105895326: 3, 11711: 3, 105847711: 3, 105789759: 3, 107301514: 3, 107390686: 3, 13937: 3, 105934985: 3, 10481: 3, 105934900: 3, 14595: 3, 14537: 3, 14568: 3, 105967115: 3, 105964496: 3, 106381959: 3, 105892608: 3, 106351162: 3, 106958423: 3, 105871367: 3, 106951875: 3, 105899248: 3, 11331: 3, 108149004: 3, 106444007: 3, 108030216: 3, 107441578: 3, 107316971: 3, 107846658: 3, 105975214: 3, 106389733: 3, 106607377: 3, 106405973: 3, 105833953: 3, 106498277: 3, 110255505: 3, 106974860: 3, 105954862: 3, 106588555: 3, 108730433: 3, 105936209: 3, 111284682: 3, 107322165: 3, 105826344: 3, 107246852: 3, 107510204: 3, 108233563: 3, 106514856: 3, 200035917: 3, 109782738: 3, 108084283: 3, 108561199: 3, 106838734: 3, 112002996: 3, 109431524: 3, 107640602: 3, 11181: 3, 106065588: 3, 110652445: 3, 108793472: 3, 105990793: 3, 106666369: 3, 105951805: 3, 108236507: 3, 200472689: 3, 108149490: 3, 111872966: 3, 107314708: 3, 108720484: 3, 112091216: 3, 106569451: 3, 111252595: 3, 105947198: 3, 112566669: 3, 107164982: 3, 12258: 3, 106121156: 3, 111278312: 3, 107559644: 3, 10510: 2, 106034624: 2, 12486: 2, 10445: 2, 105829653: 2, 106205646: 2, 106755817: 2, 106830645: 2, 108338121: 2, 107065373: 2, 106771928: 2, 106714648: 2, 108437743: 2, 107469778: 2, 111361761: 2, 107078738: 1, 105833226: 0}"

Despite being one of the most obvious lines in all of Black Velvet Canyon, it doesn't see much traffic - probably because the stunning crux pitch has a reputation for being dangerous. This reputation is well-deserved. The first 50' of the crack are 12-16"" and completely unprotectable - a fall would probably result in serious injury or death. The good news is the climbing is much easier than the grade given (5.10c) in recent guidebooks and, excepting breaking a hold, chances of blowing it are low. If you got really spooked I think you could try to burrow into the crack itself... though this would certainly not be the easiest way to climb it?

Great footholds and handholds prevent this from becoming what would otherwise be a physical battle. At the 50-foot mark the crack suddenly pinches down a bit and a 9"" cam can provide much-needed protection. A bit further the crack narrows again and a #5 Camalot will fit.

Prince of Darkness,105732458,Trad,105732162,5.10c,700,6,3.1,318.0,"Approach as for Dream of Wild Turkeys, the first pitch is shared with this climb.    Prince of Darkness ascends straight up the center of Black Velvet Wall.  From the ground, 5.10 climbing seems improbable up this blank looking face.  Once on the rock, positive edges abound.    Pitch 1: 5.6 Start up the right facing shallow corners to the crack above.  Place some gear or solo to the anchors.    Pitch 2: 5.10b From the bolted anchors, climb straight up the face past many bolts.  Mostly positive edges with a few balancy moves and slopers.  End at the bolted anchors.    Pitch 3:  5.10a From the bolted anchors, climb straight up past even more bolts and positive edges, with a few pieces of gear in the crack down low.  End at the bolted anchors.    Pitch 4:  5.9 Similar to the previous 10a pitch, but slightly easier.    Pitch 5: 5.9 The climbing starts to become more slabby, with a few longer runouts between bolts.  This pitch ends at the belay for the final crux pitch.    Pitch 6: 5.10c The crux of the climb is right off the belay past the first 2 bolts.  The rock is remarkably different as the positive edges have given way to a slick slab with a thin, shallow crack.  Fire up the crack on thin holds and smears.  Be aware that it is difficult to the first bolt and it is possible to smack into your belayer if you fall.  Edges reappear and the climbing eases off to the final anchor at an excellent ledge, which is quite welcome because all of the previous belays have been hanging.    Descent: 2 ropes are required.  You can rap the route or the adjacent Yellow Brick Road.  It is also possible to finish up Dream of Wild Turkeys and walk off.    I overheard a local call the Prince of Darkness the ""Prince of Footpain""  He was right on that accord.  The climbing isn't the most comfortable with the continuous edging, and all the hanging belays are tiring.  However, he also said the climbing wasn't that good and was monotonous.  I disagree, I think it is fabulously continuous, with great position and great protection.  The blank looking face offers a truly unique experience for a 5.10 climb.    Overall, I felt the climbing was of continuous difficulty after the first pitch, all in the 5.10- range.  I felt little difference in the grades of the various pitches until the crux moves.  The crux moves are definitely in your face.

Refried Brains,105732389,Trad,105732162,5.9,800,4,3.0,107.0,"This is a decent route which is not as time consuming as Swain's topo would indicate.  The first 6 pitches in his topo easily go in 4 rope lengths, even with a 50m rope.  The route goes to the top of the wall, but the climbing deteriorates above here, plus there are no fixed anchors, so most parties rappel after the first 4 pitches, so take two ropes.    This route is on the left side of the Black Velvet wall and gets very little sun, if any.  A good choice for a warm day.  Start near the left margin of the wall, 40' left of a huge block leaning against the base of the crag.    P1: Climb a short crack up and right, past a bolt, continue up crack and face to a 2-bolt belay on a ledge (150').      P2: Step left and climb up into a corner system to the top of a pillar on the right (with tree).  Above and right of the pillar there is now a bolted belay, the problem is this is probably 190' from the previous belay, plus the geometry can make for heinous rope drag.  We stopped atop the pillar and then moved the belay 30' over to the bolts.    P3: Here is where Swain's topo is confusing.  Step right onto the face and follow an obvious crack up.  For the most part, this crack is 1-3"", but for some short sections it is wider, but you don't have to get into the thing.  Belay after about 150' at a tree (marked the end of pitch 4 in Swain's topo), 5.9.    P4: Climb a lower-angle section past loose blocks to the base of a huge right-facing corner (visible in photos).  Don't climb the corner system, but move left onto a steep face left of the corner, and follow at least 4 bolts to a bolted belay (careful with rope drag on this pitch).    At least one party has gotten confused at this point, continuing on because they believed they were lower on the route due to the pitch lengths listed in Swain.  They report that the next anchor is a joke (for rappelling off of), so consider this anchor ""the point of last return"".

Belay at 2 bolts 5.10.    Pitch 3: More of the same...follow well spaced bolts and occasional gear to a 2 bolt anchor, 5.10-R-.    Pitch 4: Yep...same stuff only this one checks in @ 5.9R.    Pitch 5: repeat.    Pitch 6: AhHa! Change! Although ever so slight! Climb the obvious bulge up and left of the belay 5.10-.    At the 2-bolt anchor, signaling the end of this pitch, you can either rap or continue up for several more pitches in the 5.8/5.9 range.   Most people rap. If you rap, consider rapping POD, it is the cleanest section of the wall and greatly reduces the chances of rope problems.    Overall a very good route, very heady....be SURE you can handle this one before trying it!","{108353227: 4, 108824777: 4, 108468640: 4, 111772219: 4, 105890911: 4, 106246445: 4, 106655109: 4, 106652662: 4, 108607658: 4, 106073866: 4, 107482343: 4, 108101871: 4, 105978184: 4, 107052343: 4, 108154390: 4, 108538771: 4, 111415956: 4, 14120: 4, 112846784: 4, 108425823: 4, 105934900: 4, 108437743: 4, 111278312: 4, 105990793: 4, 105084340: 4, 200295870: 4, 107946583: 4, 13364: 4, 200229737: 4, 108043082: 4, 107314708: 4, 106201630: 4, 107116841: 4, 106983134: 4, 107329391: 4, 106298371: 4, 14213: 4, 106405973: 4, 106831774: 4, 107065676: 4, 107951858: 4, 105800489: 4, 107623351: 4, 106684182: 4, 105789175: 4, 105873727: 4, 106070195: 4, 107994682: 4, 105871367: 4, 105851541: 4, 106533923: 4, 106411326: 4, 13113: 4, 106646308: 4, 106564849: 4, 106928203: 4, 10788: 3, 106838734: 3, 106861594: 3, 105975214: 3, 107102882: 3, 112126443: 3, 106975876: 3, 10445: 3, 200660250: 3, 107786859: 3, 107390686: 3, 105829653: 3, 108430112: 3, 106755817: 3, 108016252: 3, 105833953: 3, 106220386: 3, 109429298: 3, 107152512: 3, 10168: 3, 107083228: 2, 109152722: 2, 112042073: 2, 200386608: 2, 105833226: 0}"
Sandstone Samurai,108382264,Trad,105732162,5.11a,700,5,3.3,8.0,"Sandstone Samurai is a route that has a bit of a reputation amongst Red Rocks climbers as being a psychological test piece: The story I heard is that the Adventure Punks established Rock Warrior as a response to the heavy-handed bolting by certain beloved Red Rocks first ascensionists, and then a year later PVB decided to up the ante by putting up something that was even bolder.    He succeeded - Sandstone Samurai is indeed a big step up from Rock Warrior - a route that  shouldn't be taken lightly! If you decide to climb it, be prepared for R-rated climbing on every pitch (run outs with falls that would likely result in injury) and possible X-rated climbing in a couple spots (if you fell, you'd almost certainly be maimed or worse); onsighting would probably be a good idea. But the climbing is fun and at the very least more engaging than it's better-protected neighbor two climbs to the right.    Anyway, the descriptions in the current guidebooks are adequate to keep you from getting lost so in an effort to preserve a sense of adventure for the full Sandstone Samurai experience, I'll leave it at that.

Sour Mash,105732407,Trad,105732162,5.10a,600,6,3.6,469.0,"Sour Mash sits there smashed in between the fascination with Epinepherine and the bolt ridden Prince Of Darkness, yet features some of the best selection of moderate climbing in the canyon. It also features a mix of styles, between traditionally protected and well bolted pitches. The bolts tend to show up when the climbing is at it's toughest on the first and crux fifth pitch. That fifth pitch is some really fun and intricate climbing that is bound to make you smile. Most parties these days do six pitches and then rappel. You need to veer to the east onto the rappel for Fiddler On The Roof, including a heart-stopping drop over the big roof the route is named for.

Original plan was to link up the first two pitches of Sour Mash to get to the 2nd pitch belay stance. I then proceeded to climb a completely different two pitch linkup (not enough rope in the 70m, I DON'T RECOMMEND LINKNG), only to find myself pulling a roof that was hard 5.10, and not the 5.9 I should have been on. I was completely off route for the first two pitches of the intended climb.  Luckily,  I was able to cleanly/safely finish a link up that went at low 5.11 to get back to the 2nd pitch belay stance. The main lesson I learned from this is to check your damn topo. Silver lining: I may have uncovered a beautiful two-pitch linkup to one of Black Velvets classics.  Currently, you will find a bush with a bunch of bail tat on it at the end of the first pitch (5.8). The second pitch takes you through the roof and has a spicy traverse left to finish the Sour Mash two pitch linkup(5.11a). I would love to have some consensus on this.

Sick for Toys,105732980,Trad,105732198,5.10+,400,4,3.3,15.0,"This route would probably be quite popular if any of the guidebooks actually told you where it is.  It is NOT near the Western Spaces Wall.  Approach by going up the south fork of Black Velvet Canyon, past the start of Epinephrine, to the fork at the white slab.  Here, take the right branch up the wash along the north side of Corduroy Ridge.  About two or three hundred yards past the white slab, the canyon widens and there is a large beautiful slab on the left side.  Sick for Toys is the thin fingertip crack on the left side of the slab.    Pitch 1: A broken ledge system stretches across the lower left side of the slab, beneath a few layers of roof-arches.  Start below the right end of these ledges, just to the left of a bush.  The boulder that simplified the opening moves has been washed away, so the first fifteen feet involve some balancy 5.9 with a bad landing.  Once you get onto the easy rock, go a long way to the left.  When leftward progress is finally blocked by the arches (maybe 50 feet or so), climb over them to a bush.  Go right and up on easy face climbing for quite some distance to a bolted belay station at the base of the thin crack.  Other than the first few moves, the climbing is 5.5 and under.  The issues of rope drag, spotting the leader, and protecting the second provide some challenge on this otherwise easy pitch.    Pitch 2: Climb straight up the crack (5.8) to a hanging belay at two more bolts.  (From this belay, look down and right about 30 feet to a bolted station on the blank face.  This can be reached in a long rappel from the top of the route, and allows a somewhat straighter descent.)    Pitch 3: Continue up the vanishing crack (5.10b), passing 4 bolts to another belay station on a tiny ledge.    Pitch 4: Climb up past a bolt, jog briefly right to surmount the roof, then continue up the finger crack above.

Desert Gold,105934919,Trad,105732084,5.13a,150,2,3.9,18.0,"Desert Gold is perhaps the most striking, photogenic pitch in all of Red Rocks. Classic pictures of the likes of Paul Van Betten, Peter Croft, Brian McCray, Roxana Brock, Katie Brown and many others have adorned the pages of guidebooks and magazines for years. And there's a reason for this: The line features an unbelievable dead horizontal splitter roof crack; climbers are pictured hanging underneath this beast from jams, completely inverted - it's a mind-boggling sight.    The first ascent of the roof was completed in 1984 by PVB and Richard Harrison. Paul apparently had a shrine in his home dedicated to the amazing Separate Reality in Yosemite and was ecstatic when he discovered this likeness, here at his home crag of Red Rocks. Choosing to avoid the intimidating overhanging fingercrack splitter that led up to the roof, they aided in on two bolts (since consolidated to one) and climbed the roof only from an uncomfortable hanging belay. They rated it the same as Separate Reality: 5.11d which is a major sandbag unless you have massive mitts.    Three years later PVB returned with Sal Mamusia to finish what he started (or start what he finished rather) by climbing the finger crack directly up to the roof at 5.12c. This was named ""Desert Crack"".    A month later the great Stefan Glowacz made the obvious linkup by climbing this whole thing in one pitch. Really this should be considered the true first ascent and is now the way the route is climbed: Desert Gold, 5.13a.    Begin by climbing an approach pitch (5.9 PG13) on the left wall below the massive roof. This is actually quite enjoyable. Traverse right on a thin foot ledge towards loose blocks, or continue up a massive hollow flake and then move right. This leads to a bolted belay at a sloping stance. 90'. Alternatively, climb Clipper (best option) or West Edge Lane to this same belay.    Clip a bolt off the belay with a long runner and step left around the arete into a junky corner. Up this a few moves and then back onto the arete. Stretch right to the crack, place pro, and commit to the short but surprisingly steep finger crack. There is basically one move of each size - tips through hands - on the way to the roof, so no matter your hand size, there's a crux for you! Under the roof, cop a pumpy rest and avoid clipping the lowering bolt; instead launch outwards. #2 Camalots quickly widen to #3 Camalots at the lip where a jug awaits for pulling over to the top. For many this ""11d"" section proves to be the crux.    Upon finishing, most will down aid back across the roof to the lowering bolt. This bolt is a 5/8"", 6"" long monster and is absolutely bomber. From here lower back to the belay and rap.

The Madcap Laughs,107504836,Trad,105732084,5.12,120,1,4.0,1.0,"Named after the Syd Barrett (Pink Floyd's early frontman) solo album, The Madcap Laughs is one fine pitch of rock climbing.  From the moment you leave the ground this thing keeps after you in one way or another for a long ways... it's only one pitch, but it feels like an eternity.    Begin by climbing up and into a huge, overhanging scoop of rock; one bolt protects the initial moves, and another in the roof protects a grovelly move onto an airy perch.  Here a small TCU in suspect rock will provide some peace of mind for an awkward sequence working leftwards past hollow holds to a very small stance at the base of the left arete of the formation.  The exposure here is thrilling.    Launch up the arete, clipping three bolts, and then move through a steep section utilizing blind, thin horizontals.  Wiggling in 0 and 00 TCU's here is pulse-quickening.  A bolt here would have changed everything - I'm very appreciative of the FA's vision in leaving this thing naturally protected where possible, yet reasonably safe, even though as such it is all so unlikely.  Anyway, a few more moves leads to a thank-god placement, then some easier climbing to an intermediate anchor at a small stance.  This is a hands-free sit down rest and the route could be done in two pitches with a belay here. In any case, regroup and launch straight up onto the overhanging, chocolaty checkerboard face above.  This is the crux: huge lockoffs on good holds and fiddling in small wires in a vague, crack-like seam.      A single 70m rope allows rappel from the anchors atop the formation all the way back to the staging area at the base.  While the climbing is probably safe, long falls on this route are possible if you're trying hard, hence my giving it a PG-13 rating.  This is a neo-classic if there ever was such a thing.",{10168: 4}
Papillon,114119467,Trad,105732084,5.12c,300,3,4.0,1.0,"This route is an amazing journey and one of the best climbs in Red Rocks.  Start just left of Seduction Line. Belayer can stand on a chockstone at the top of a loose chimney.  P1 (110’, 5.12b): Jerry Handren, in his typical understated fashion, describes this pitch as “worrying."" I'm inclined to agree. Expect difficult-to-read climbing and protection that is compounded by a steadily increasing pump. Begin by carefully scrambling up decomposing rock to a short left-facing corner and roof. Undercling around this and continue up a left-facing layback. Committing moves lead to a shake and questionable gear. From this stance traverse leftwards across the wall to an obvious pod near the arete. From here on out the gear is good but it is pumpy to place and well-spaced. Launch upwards onto the varnished headwall to a climatic crux near the top of the pitch. If you blow it from here, you will punch a hole in the sky. Don’t blow it, and instead move right to a bolted anchor on a comfortable ledge. Take extreme care to manage rope drag on this pitch (see note under protection).  P2 (100’, 5.12c): Mostly bolted, but bring a 0.75 Camalot and a few slings. Left off the belay then up the wall via interesting pockets formed by thin patches of varnish. The first crux is a long reach and thin traverse left to a good hold. The second crux is pulling the roof above. Insecure climbing leads to a bolted anchor at a stance.  P3 (100’, 5.11b): Entirely bolted, but sparsely so. Wander up the varnished face above. Unfortunately a lot of the rock here feels quite fragile but if you made it through the first two pitches this will be a walk in the park.

P3: Negotiate a potentially awkward flare for about 3 feet to get to the climbing you came up here for. Lieback jam and smear up this awesome crack to its terminus at a roof. Step to the left and belay at a two bolt anchor. From here it's two raps to the ground with a 70m rope.  P4?: Adventurous (suicidal) climbers may proceed up and left through an extremely chossy roof crack with loose blocky jugs at about 5.10+ to another large ledge, where the route may lead to more climbing to the top of the Monument.

Burros Gone Wild,118567639,Trad,114107836,5.10+,420,4,2.0,1.0,"Burros Gone Wild is a good ol' pitch of blue-collar struggle high on the Mustang Wall. It is more or less a variation to the finish of either The Dragon or Pegasus - climbing a flaring chimney created by a massive flake sandwiched between the upper parts of those routes. Kinda reminiscent of the Epinephrine chimneys but much harder. It's quite fun if you're into this sort of thing and the rock is clean and well-varnished.  P1-3: Climb either the first 3.5 pitches of The Dragon or the first 3 pitches of Pegasus and belay on the long belay ledge out right of the teetering Jenga Flake.  P4: Climb leftwards off the ledge, across the Jenga Flake, and up as for The Dragon, but at the base of the Green Corner, move back right across varnished edges to access the bottom of the massive flake. It would be possible to set up an uncomfortable hanging belay here which will really help with rope drag up higher. If you link through, as was done on the FA, it is important to back clean or heavily runner as much as possible up to this point or pay the price. Another solid option might be to climb on two ropes and drop one once at the flake. Launch up into the flare behind the flake - easy at first, and harder up high fighting through a steep OW section.

The Dragon,115678949,Trad,114107836,5.11a,460,5,3.6,9.0,"The Dragon is a fantastic climb up the massive corner system on the left side of the Mustang Wall. Unusual for Red Rocks, this route features sections of physical crack climbing on every pitch and excellent rock. It is consistent in difficulty, with the exception of a brief slab crux (the higher traverse following bolts with black hangers). This crux can be avoided by taking a natural but circuitous variation (the lower traverse following bolts with tan hangers): at 5.10-, it is easier but can create rope drag (intermediate belay on the Pegasus ledge recommended).  Sure to be a classic; the tedious approach through the desert from the Black Velvet parking lot is all that keeps this thing from having lines on it like the other great routes in Red Rocks.  Begin just above a spindly, twisted pine tree just up and left from the black crack that marks the start of Pegasus. A landmark is the curving, right-facing white flake halfway up the first pitch. Do not start below a lone, low bolt in a right facing corner - this is an off-route bolt and is much too far left.  P1 (5.10-, 100’): Follow a shallow, right facing corner (tricky pro) up until level with the white flake. Protect high in the corner, then step down and left to move over to the flake (0.5 Camalot in a slot protects this traverse for leader and follower), then follow the flake (bolt) to a belay on a chockstone.  P2 (5.10-, 90’): Up the wide corner (bolt), then carefully negotiate a loose section (bolt), finishing with a steep crack to an awesome belay ledge.  P3 (5.10-, 70’): Continue up the nice corner which concludes with a physical struggle past two bolts to a belay at a good stance.  You have a choice for P4:  P4a (5.11a, 120’): The line of the FA heads up past some pockets to a thin slab crux passing four bolts with black hangers. From here tiptoe up the teetering Jenga flake and then reach wildly up and left to good holds on the steep wall above (appears unprotected but there is solid, hidden gear). Continue into the Green Corner to a good belay ledge. This is the better and more direct line but is significantly harder than anything else on the route.  P4b (5.10, 120’): Climb up and then move right on a curving ramp passing three bolts with tan hangers to the long Pegasus belay ledge. I strongly recommend belaying here to minimize rope drag. From the ledge, move straight left past a black bolt to reach the teetering Jenga flake, cross the flake and tiptoe up, then reach wildly up and left to good holds on the steep wall above (appears unprotected but there is solid, hidden gear). Continue into the Green Corner to a good belay ledge. This is an easier and perhaps more natural path, but it is wandering and probably best done with an intermediate belay on the Pegasus ledge (if you intend to do this, it would make sense to link P3 into the first half of P4b to the intermediate belay).  P5 (5.10-, 80’): Climb the steep, varnished lieback (#4 Camalots) to a wedged block, then follow the splitter handcrack up the right face to the top.

P5: Climb the amazing arete via some thin and possibly reachy moves, keeping mostly to the left side of the arete to a small rooflet and stance. Gather yourself and move right around the arete to the radically overhanging side and bust a few powerful moves before grabbing the brick and swinging back left. Continue through a v-slot to an airy belay perch. 8 bolts and an optional #2 Camalot protect, but an attentive belay is essential as falls from high on the crux could land you on the ominous slabby wall behind you. Fantastic climbing. 5.13a, 80'.    P6: The original route heads straight up from the belay(*), but the way we finished was via the incredible Golden Desert pitch: Move left off the belay, clipping a bolt to access a steep, exposed flake system. Committing climbing up these large and sometimes hollow features brings the climber a few good rests and ultimately to a cruxy thin crack that is difficult to protect. Higher the crack opens up and accepts better gear and more of one's fingers. A rightwards crack switch and a romp up blocks leads to the penultimate belay station on Tri Tip. Wild position. 5.12a PG13, 150'.    Rap with two ropes or with a single 80m plus some shenanigans.    (*)The original route is as follows: From the belay above the crux arete, climb a thin, left-facing flake feature (5.11?, 75') and then trundle up to a belay on a comfy ledge. From this belay, head up a splitter tips and fingers crack (5.13a?, 75'), stepping left via some face holds to an easier corner which leads to the same belay above the Golden Desert pitch.    N.B. There is a rather fragile and important hold on the 5.13 pitch where one turns the corner that has already broken once - use care. Hint: this is a foothold - don't even touch it with your hands.","{106027958: 4, 10168: 3}"
Texanephrine,107149299,Trad,112127841,5.10d,1500,14,3.0,19.0,"For those looking for another long route of moderate difficulty in Red Rock, this combination of three routes offers a nice alternative to the more popular trade routes in Black Velvet Canyon. I added an unofficial name to this combination  Three of a kind  (in the same genre of ""Texas HoldEm"") just to distinguish it from the multiple other linkups in the area and to provide a forum for putting it on this web site so others can do this great route. (Based on other comments I changed it to what sounds like the original name - Texanephrine.) It combines the easiest pitches of Texas Hold Em with the classic upper open book pitches of Epinephrine and has a few fun pitches in the middle to link them together. It can be done in about the same time as it takes to do Epinephrine, but has a much harder crux pitch that anyone who loves 5.10 crack climbing in Red Rock canyon should aspire to climb just for that pitch alone.  Pitch description:  Pitch 1  5.8 120 feet: Start 100 feet to the right of Epinephrine and 40 feet to the left of the giant corner system. Climb some broken ledges up to a bush passing the bush on the right and climbing a short left facing dihedral until you can step right onto holds on the face. Climb up and right past a creaky flake into the giant left facing corner system. Climb this to a small roof with twin cracks (crack in the corner and crack on the face to the right). Turn the roof, climb a short distance further then traverse left to a chain belay. Pitch 2  5.8 120 feet: Step up onto the face and climb the easiest features (left a bit, then back right a bit) putting gear in pods as needed until you are back at the corner system. Climb the corner for approximately 80 feet along beautiful very black varnished rock until you encounter a  bolt on the overhanging face up on the right wall. Note there is a second, unrelated bolt, about 30 feet right above a blank face.  Clip the bolt with a long sling to avoid rope drag, step back down and climb directly right for about 30 feet then up towards the brush to a ledge where you step left to the chains, Pitch 3  5.7 120 feet: Move right to the dirty corner, climb it into the brush and continue up a short distance to a ledge. Traverse a long distance along this ledge until in ends below a crack system in a corner. Establish a belay here. Pitch 4  5.8 160 feet: Climb up the crack directly above eventually working your way left and upwards through a fat section then straight up a short lie back and finally up left to a set of anchors directly below the obvious steep left leaning crack above. Pitch 5  5.10d 160 feet: A fantastic pitch combining burly fist jams, delicate face and thin fingers. Climb wide fins, cracks, and slots for about 25 feet to reach the wide crack through a roof.  Climb the left angling crack above until it becomes thin face climbing past 3 bolts. At the Third bolt continue over the roof into the thin finger crack and climb it until it ends on the ledge and anchors just below the top of Texas Tower. Pitch 6  5.9 90 feet: Climb directly up the right hand of two crack seams for 35-40 feet.  Locate a discontinuous ledge.  Use it to  step left easily into the next crack system.  Climb the new crack up and left to a belay. Pitch 7  5.9+ 120 feet (combines 2 of Texas tower connection pitches to avoid a belay with old bolts): Traverse down and left to a ledge at the base of a corner. Climb the corner a short distance to an ancient bolt. Back up the bolt with gear in the crack. Traverse left further past another ancient bolt into a corner with an old belay. Put an extra long sling on this belay to reduce rope drag and climb straight up the corner past about 7 old bolts until you can step right onto a ledge with a belay (that has a newer bolt). Pitch 8  5.7 80 feet: Step left from the fixed anchor and climb up the arete to the short chimney area. Locate and clip a new bolt on a block out left. Clip this to protect the traverse above. Step up and left around the roof to the right side of the Elephants trunk. Climb another 20-30 feet to gain a ledge with a bolted anchor.  All the remaining pitches are well described in many guides that discuss Epinephrine  Pitch 9  5.9 80 feet: Climb from the top of the Elephants trunk up a face with 2 bolts and think cracks up to a ledge (this pitch can easily be linked with the prior pitch). Pitch 10  5.9 120 feet: Climb the steep corner past 5 bolts to a small ledge Pitch 11  5.7 160 feet: Climb the long corner to a flared pod pseudo ledge with two rap anchors. (As of 2011 this was the last remaining rappel anchor. The next set of anchors has been removed from the top of the next pitch. If you continue past this point there are no further fixed belays and you'll need to walk off from the summit). Pitch 12  5.9 140 feet: Climb up the face to the right edge of some roofs. Climb the roofs to an alcove where the bolts no longer exist. Traverse left then climb to an area where you can place a safe belay. Pitch 13  5.7 150 feet: Climb up until you reach the ramp and put in a belay Pitches 14 and up: 4th class for a long ways up the ramp to the right of a large bulging roof then far right across ledge systems and a steep exposed area until you arrive at a tree on the ridge of Black Velvet peak.","{108824777: 4, 107936895: 4, 106774743: 4, 111233943: 3, 105826344: 3, 200142486: 3, 111971885: 3, 112212034: 3, 106738886: 3, 106070195: 3, 11181: 3, 106554608: 3, 107896521: 3, 106838734: 3, 107890097: 3, 105829653: 3, 107099407: 3, 107363518: 3, 107469778: 0}"

Optional Belay on a large ledge with lots of bushes, otherwise: scramble left through the bushes to a small left-facing corner, up this and then traverse back right across a slab to a higher, small, left-facing corner/arete. Up this, passing a bolt, and continue more easily to a great belay ledge with bolted anchor. 130' to this point and a good place to stop and belay. From here, continue up the slab above, then diagonal rightwards across the slab (#2 or #3 Camalots in horizontals, and higher a thread) until reaching the previously mentioned huge, hanging left-facing dihedral just above a tree. Climb this to near it's top where there is a bolt up and left and another one up and right (the righthand one is situated above a shelf. Either way goes, but I find the righthand variation both easier and more direct. Belay just above at a good ledge with a bolted anchor. 260' to this point. Continue up the left-facing corner right of the belay to a huge, bushy terrace. Cut right through the bushes and belay on gear below a water-polished groove/crack feature at the right end of the terrace. 400' to this point and most of the climbing on these pitches checks in at 5.8.    P4:  Follow the groove up and left, taking either a slot or a handcrack and passing (or stopping at) a couple bolted anchors, to a gear belay on a good ledge.  150', 5.8.    P5:  Climb up through the roof with a few wide-hands moves to a stance, then continue up the spectacular, exposed crack system past 3 bolts to a bolted belay on a big ledge just below the top of Texas Tower.  180', 5.10.    P6:  There are two left-trending crack systems above.  Begin up the right of the two, then traverse to the left crack about 50' up.  Follow this to a bolted belay way left of the line.  You can link this into the next pitch but the rope drag through the crux is heinous.  100', 5.9.  Alternatively, you can stay in the right-hand crack at awesome 5.12 with one move of aid past a small roof midway up.  This variation has several bolts and joins up with the following pitch near the end.  140', 5.12.    P7:  Perform a bouldery move off the belay, then climb up an easy corner to a bolt.  Hand traverse right to a pumpy clip and stand up on a sloping ledge.  Follow this up to a small roof (bolt over the roof) and climb up into the left-facing corner above, clipping a couple bolts along the way to a bolted belay below an obvious V-slot.  100', 5.11c.    P8:  Climb the V-slot (two bolts protect) to a cruxy traverse/downclimb at a bolt, then more V-slot action up to a bolted belay at a stance.  100', 5.11b.    P9:  I won't spoil it all by giving away the last pitch, but from here the route is obvious.  If you're rapping, make sure to fix your tag line to the previous belay or you will be dangling in space.  Otherwise, continue on with Lone Star.  140', 5.10.

Continue up the bolted wall above past a difficult 5.12 stemming section to an intermediate anchor at a steep stance (do not belay here).  Head up and left, then back right along an interesting feature on a beautiful wall.  Some balancey 5.12 in there before reaching a bolted belay.  An amazing pitch!    P4:  The Velvet Tongue goes straight up the left-facing corner above.  Instead, step straight right past a bolt and a difficult boulder problem.  Clip the first bolt on the next pitch and down climb to a bolted anchor.  V6-7, 20'.    P5:  Head up the interesting right-facing flare/corner passing a tightly bolted crux section (5.12d, desparate).  Alternatively, break off to the right and up a green, mossy face and head back left, bypassing the crux.  Either way, continue up the corner past some hand-size gear placements before stepping wildly out left around the arete and up to another bolted belay.  Spectacular.

It has nearly perfect rock, excellent protection, and a dramatic steep pitch that offers great views of all the sheep waiting in line on the established classics to the left.    P1 (120’, 5.11b): From the table-sized starting ledge, climb up to an obvious right-facing undercling flake. Move out this and lieback up the side before gaining a incipient finger crack in perfect rock. Load up the very top of the crack with gear and traverse straight right and slightly down on unprotected face holds before continuing up to the bottom of another finger crack (and solid protection). Continue to a bolted, hanging belay at a tiny foothold (or link into the next pitch as the first ascentionists did).    P2 (140’, 5.10c): The finger crack trends up and slightly right from the belay, but there are two or three parallel finger cracks off to the left. You can follow any of these crack systems, but eventually you will need to move to the leftmost of these in order to reach the next belay. Traversing as early as possible will allow for the best quality and most uninterrupted climbing experience. At the top of the crack systems, step left to one-foot wide flat ledge, and then continue up a ramp to the left a few more feet to a hidden bolted anchor.

Belay above at a bolted anchor.P4 (5.9, 100'): Climb the ""Wax Crack"" - a nice, steep left-facing handcrack. Yes, the left wall is very slippery. Belay at a scrub oak/webbing anchor.P5 (5.9, 80'): Climb steep cracks to a left-facing flake, move right and tunnel underneath a huge, interesting chockstone to an awkwardly-located bolted belay on the ""Mushroom"" - a large tower separate from the main wall.Rap the route or continue, via free climbing or free climbing and a touch of aid, up the extension.","{10168: 1, 105829653: 1}"
Wax Cracks Extension (Open Project),119825298,Trad,112127841,5.12b/c,220,2,2.0,2.0,"This is a two pitch extension to Wax Cracks. The first pitch is an open project, and the second is a spectacular, steep, twisting dihedral.Approach: Climb Wax Cracks; belay on the spacious ledge behind the Mushroom tower.P1 (5.12b/c, 120'): 7x bolts, a #1 Camalot, and a set of stoppers protect. Climb up into the pretty, varnished right-facing corner, then traverse rightwards out of a corner (crux) on glassy feet to a seam. Follow this up and back left into the corner which can then be followed to a bolted belay. All the moves have been freed on this pitch (about 12b/c), but there's still some work to be done (some loose rock). Additionally, the corner has been climbed directly (5.13), but leading it would likely require 2-3x more bolts. All in all this pitch is OK and will be much better once cleaned up and possibly re-engineered, but from a difficulty standpoint it is very much out of character with the rest of the climbing on Wax Cracks. On the plus side, one can aid it at 5.11- C0 to access the impressive second pitch.P2 (5.10+, 100'): Climb the curving corner system. It starts out left-facing and steep, then switches to right-facing and gets even steeper.Rap with a 70m rope (watch your ends on the crux pitch) and continue down Wax Cracks.","{10168: 2, 105829653: 2}"
Black Sun,108067756,Trad,105732195,5.10,650,6,2.0,1.0,"Overall, this is a fun route with some good pitches. A few probably a really bad idea to fall right now moments in 9-10a territory keep this from being a route I wholeheartedly recommend. You want to be solid at adventure climbing and plan on topping out. Bailing after the first pitch will cost you some gear.     Pitch 1, 110' (10c) Climb a right facing corner (the left most) up to where the corner turns to the right. Youll diagonal left across the face and three bolts and gear and finally up to the base of a shallow and thin corner. Bolted anchor.    Pitch 2, 100' (10) All the guidebooks gave this pitch a 10a. Climb straight up the thin seem (wires) to a really fun finger crack with interesting and memorable climbing. Continue up to a bolt and look up at an impressive slightly overhanging headwall with a couple of thin cracks. Take a deep breath and traverse diagonally right underneath this headwall and across the face to a thin crack leading straight up to the base of the chimney of pitch 3. Gear anchor (bigger pieces BD #3/#4).       Pitch 3, 100' (9) Up the chimney eventually making a slight jog to the right before continuing up and taking the left of two cracks. Gear anchor. The guidebooks end the pitch here saying that it ends below a roof. We found that not to be the case and there was another pitch before the roof.     Pitch 4, 90' (9) Climb straight up a finger crack with plenty of face holds to belay below a roof. Gear anchor. You could combine 3 & 4, I believe. Combined, it would be a long pitch and not 90'.     Pitch 5, 180' (10) The rock quality below the roof sucks. The roof spans a horizontal distance of at least 30 and is of good rock. Pick the line of least resistance (or most fun) and go at it keeping in mind that your gear probably sucks. The difficulties subside quickly and you diagonal right to the big corner climbing fun huecos for as long as you can. Gear anchor at the base of a chimney.      Pitch 6, 70-80' (6) Up the chimney to an obvious exit and the top.     The first two pitches are really fun, good, with memorable movement. Rock quality on parts of 3 and 4 and the initial section of 5 make this a heady undertaking.  ",{12486: 2}

Climb the face to the crack leading to the right facing corner. Up the corner to a ledge and a bolted anchor.    Pitch 2, 150' (10a) Directly off the belay ledge head around the corner to the left to a black face.

We climbed this first but I down climbed after 30 feet or so. gear was crappy and the holds were less than inspiring. The crack on the left went well enough and could be surprisingly well protected. Stay in the crack trending left.    You're heading for a steep gully that eventually leads to the top in another pitch or so.     The first four pitches are fun and on mostly good rock.

We (I) led us off route on the third pitch, and we had to add a traversing pitch in order to get back on route. If anyone makes the same mistake, this is an appropriate correction. If anyone climbs the route proper, feel free to augment our information.    Also, the Handren description is very inaccurate. Grades seem to be correct, but pitch lengths are way off.    This rock on this route prevents me giving more stars. You should only climb this route of you are comfortable at the grade, and are familiar with the more friable sandstone found in Red Rock.    Approach as for Western Spaces Wall. This involves climbing up fixed ropes, and quite a bit of chimneying. Arrive at the base of the climb after the last chimney. The first bolt of the first pitch should be apparent ca. 10 ft above.    Pitch 1, 140' (10cR) Climb past the first bolt, performing a sporty move that leads to a crack that runs up and slightly left. Climb to a second bolt, and up to a left-facing corner. climb the corner or arete a while to a a bolt below a roof. Traverse left, and maneuver above the roof, climbing up and slightly right to a two-bolt anchor.    Pitch 2, 120' (7+) Climb up and right past lichen-covered rock and gain a crack/corner system that leads slightly right and up.

Climb up to a ledge and clip a bolt up high. Climb past the bolt and follow a crack up and left to a ledge with a large pine tree and a couple of smaller trees. Belay off of the pine. NOTE: This is the pitch that we got off route. The correct belay is where the crack branches, but this was not apparent at the time. The next pitch describes how to get back on route.    Pitch 4, 120' (8R) Move onto the face of the buttress to the right. Climb up until you can get decent gear, and traverse right at the top of the formation.

Western Spaces is one of the shortest routes on the wall and set up for rapping although you could top out after another pitch or so and do the walk off. Like some of the other routes on this wall, the rock quality varies and the climbing always keeps you engaged.    Pitch 1. 10- (120') From the left end of the ledge, climb up a right facing corner, escaping the corner to the left before the corner turns right. Climb upwards and slightly left to an obvious bolted anchor. One old, but fairly good looking bolt, protects some fun climbing on brittle flakes on this pitch.    Pitch 2. 10 (130') Diagonal right across the face passing a bolt to reach a shallow corner crack.

The anchor is made up of four nuts.    Pitch 4. 11- (120') Climb the obvious crack passing a bolt and gingerly pulling the sporty crux on less than confidence inspiring flakes. Eventually you reach the last bolted belay and rappel anchor.    Rappel the route with two 60 meter ropes. Pitch length were estimates and I don't think a 70 would get you all the way down.

The second pitch is classic, with sustained crack to face to layback/chimney moves, and is a four star pitch in my book. The upper two pitches are easier but more serious feeling than I had expected- the top pitch in particular, which turns an exciting roof on absolutely huge horns/jugs which may or may not break off one day, and then tops out on the furthest right tip of the Wholesome Fullback buttress, smack dab in the middle of Black Velvet. Views of the whole canyon, from Triassic to Epinephrine, make the summit a neat spot to hang out before rapping the route on double ropes.

Recently, Scary Larry, Bill Thiry, and Thomas Ribiere went on a scouting mission up a potential line that moves up the face just right of Frogland. The initial pitches went mostly as planned, but after a bit of a miscommunication, the upper portion of what Larry had in mind was left unclimbed and instead the team moved up to the summit via some easier ground. Although the team had put up a good line and had had a great day, Larry felt that the line he had in mind should still be attempted in the very near future.    After a bit of wrangling, Larry recruited yours truly into the mission of completing the climb as Larry had originally envisioned. So, we headed out to Black Velvet and, almost without incident put up the climb as Larry wanted, and it turned out great.     This route is a solid step up from Frogland, and is, in many ways, a better route overall. This is a good option for experienced parties that find themselves waiting in line for Frogland and enjoy a good adventure.    Head for the base of Frogland and rope up about 25' left of the start in a corner with a good looking finger crack. (This is just past the little step across on the ledge system)    Pitch 1: Head up the corner over a bulge to a ledge with some bushes. From here, step right and continue up another corner to the first belay of Frogland. 5.7, 120'    Pitch 2: The best pitch on the route. Start as for the second pitch of Frogland. Head up the left leaning ramp, but instead of continuing up the corner, climb the beautiful crack on the right hand wall. (There is another crack about 10' to its right that is probably harder to climb and to protect.) About 70' up, this crack ends. Step right to gain the upper part of the other crack and follow this to belay.  5.8+, 120'    Pitch 3: About 185' above this ledge is a prominent buttress protruding from the main face. The next belay is at the base of this. Head straight up through some bushes, and then strike out onto the face above. Head generally straight up, following the pro. 5.6, 185'    Pitch 4: This pitch looks harder than it is. Step up and right from belay, under a small lip protruding from the base of the buttress. Step up again and then step left onto the top of the lip. Follow this flake up and left until it ends. Pass a small bulge and climb the right facing corner above to a series of small ledges. Edit: From here on out, your goal is to stay generally to the left, aiming for the beautiful slabs above and the summit overhangs. 5.7+, 70'    Pitch 5: Just left of belay is a neat, but short, finger crack. Follow this and then step onto a right leaning ramp and follow it until a large horn is reached. From here, head straight up the beautiful face, following the pro, until an arête is reached. Step right and follow the ramp up and left toward a weakness in the summit overhangs.  Belay on a cozy ledge below an improbable looking corner on the left. Edit: Again, you're aiming somewhat left off belay, going for the very obvious slab above. 5.6, 150'    Pitch 6: Step left to the corner, and head up it on the face just left. Protection is obvious.

Pitch 3 goes straight up to the beginning of the good varnished rock, then moves right on easy ledges.  Pitch 4 starts with a zigzag to the right, then back into an obvious chimney.  Pitch 5 goes up and right on deteriorating rock, ultimately reaching broken third-class rock just west of the Whiskey Peak summit.    Other than possibly as a variation on pitch 1 of Frogland, there is not much reason to do this route.

It is a left-facing, tiger-striped corner with no apparent gear. There is gear, but be willing to do crux climbing above it.  Begin by doing a short pitch up to a big ledge. Take the first pitch of Triassic (5.7), or take cracks on the face just right. From an optional belay on this ledge (best done as one pitch if you can solo or backclean the start), launch up the corner past a few good stances and good gear placements to a cruxy section of gaston palm-smearing on a weird rib of rock on the left wall. If all goes well you'll end up in a chimney position, back to the corner, with a no-hands rest.

Scramble up a few 4th-class sections to the a nice terrace and the beginning of a LF corner/crack that has a few bolts (why?)...      P1: 5.7, 150'  Climb a crack in a block (awkward) to gain the left-facing corner/crack.  Climb this for a nice long pitch and belay on the second of two big ledges.  Tree anchor.    P2: 5.7, 150'  Work right from the belay and climb a lower-angle crack in a LF corner to a ledge.  From here (a) Make a few exciting moves out left and up a crack to another ledge. Or (b) continue straight up through a wide overhanging flake/crack section to a small ledge.    P3: 5.6, 100'  Work out left into a nice right-facing dihedral, up this, then out right through a small overhang and belay at the base of an obtuse corner with some thin face moves to the right.    The next 3 pitches are PG so be ready for some spice!    P4: 5.8, 140'  Climb out left of the thin corner on small edges and thin pro.  Gain a decent crack that climbs up to the right side of the giant roof clipping an old pin along the way.  Check out the slabby leftward traverse under the roof which marks the crux of the route.  Make the delicate moves across to a thin crack and up about 40' to a small belay stance that takes 1.5-3"" gear.  Awesome!    P5: 5.8, 130'  Make some PG face moves up to a bolt.  Climb up left to a huge chockstone and tunnel behind it.  Work up and right into a right-facing corner and up to a ledge with tricky belay gear.    P6: 5.6, 160'?  Work out right onto the face and let the better gear lead your way up to a small bulge at the top.  Turn the bulge and head up 5.2 terrain to the top.

Geriatrics (aka Ben Dover Beelzebub),113772549,Trad,116681308,5.12a,320,3,3.0,2.0,"Sustained, excellent technical climbing.    P1 (110', 5.12a): Climb a right-leaning seam with small pro. Clip the first of many bolts as you work up a steep slab to a traverse right and a belay on the arete. Really good climbing.    P2 (100', 5.12a): Difficult to grade this pitch: The crux felt like a V4 boulder problem that is not too bad once you figure it out; the remainder of the pitch is 11- tops. Immediately off the belay execute the intricate crux sequence and then follow sometimes friable/hollow rock straight up the face over two small roofs to an anchor in a scoop. A heady lead. Note: Belaying at the stance below the anchor can interfere with the climber during the crux. I advise either extending the belay well below the anchor until the crux is complete, or skipping the belay altogether by linking the first two pitches.    P3 (110', 5.11d): Follow bolts up the wall to a cruxy concavity. Above move left to a rest and then back right under a roof. Pass the roof on the right (#4 Camalot placement) and continue up more easily to an anchor which is oddly positioned far to the left. A great pitch.

Only the Good Die Young,105732479,Trad,116681308,5.11b/c,750,5,3.2,81.0,"Kudos, again, the the ASCA folks who rebolted this climb, taking from an obscure, old-rusty-bolts-that-will-snap scarefest to a super-safe, super-classic climb. Don't let the 5.11 grade scare you off, the cruxs are very well bolted with big, fat, new, shiny ASCA hangers. This climb is so well bolted, the cruxes could easily be yarded through (A0 style).  Anyhow, get to the route by first finding Wholesome Fullback. After you find this climb, hike climber's right for roughly 300 feet. As you go ascend slightly, you'll be heading up into the mouth of a narrow canyon that splits Whiskey Peak and Black Velvet Wall. Keep your eyes peeled up for a bolt 10-15 feet off the deck; this will be the give away for the route's start, and will be on the same wall as Wholesome Fullback, that has now become the left side of the narrow canyon you are heading up. Again, the route will be between 300 and 500 feet climber's right of Wholesome Fullback. As you look up at the super-shiny new hanger, you'll see several (3-4) other bolts about 40 feet up, twisting around a corner. Here you are looking at the second pitch, to give you a good idea of how short the pitches really are. So now you have found the climb.  P1.  Step off the boulder and clip a bolt.  Make bouldery moves past the bolt to gain a stance. Place additional gear and move up the thin crack in a left facing corner.  The climbing eases but the wall steepens.  Place gear and move up and right to gain the bolted anchor The first pitch goes in Supertopo as 10d, but I felt it was more 10bish, a one-move wonder. Place some cams, and go up to the first set of anchors.  P2:  From the belay step right to gain a roof. Make unique, bouldery moves to gain a stance on the roof. Move right into the corner and up. Make a long reach left to clip the third bolt.  Continue up into a small alcove/roof. Climb through the alcove/roof following a continuously narrowing crack for another 40 or more feet to belay at a fixed anchor.  Pitch 2 is the business at 5.11 plus, with bolts right there the whole time. This is a super-steep, super-fun portion of this climb; a few of the holds are climbing gym-esque. As you reach the second anchor, you'll already be getting psyched for the great-looking third pitch.  P3: Make face and crack moves on a ramp and left facing corner passing several bolts, with potential for gear between them. As the ramp steepens to face and the crack closes out make delicate face moves past a couple more bolts to gain the fixed anchor.  Begin this pitch with easy slab moves, progressing into several 5.10 moves to the belay. As the pitch continues, so does the difficulty. Thank goodness for those incuts...Here we go, this is the crux.  P4: Climb up clipping two bolts to the challenging traverse.  Decipher (or not) the best sequence for your height and finger size across the face and upward to the horizontal crack.  Hand traverse right and around the corner to gain a stance on the next face. Very thin seams and edges lead up a nearly blank face past two bolts in solid rock to gain a potential belay stance (place wide gear) or continue up the face into a right facing corner over easy ground but less quality rock to a large ledge.  Belay here or continue another 10 feet to gain the final terrace. Place long runners on bolts 2 and 4 to avoid rope drag.  Pitch 4, you can see the three shiny traverse bolts, where the climbing is the most difficult right at the beginning of the traverse, and eases as you get the overhang, which are really jugs. Use long runners on the first and last traverse bolts, or suffer the consequences of severe rope drag. Also notice the original Urioste bolt...don't both clipping it, I talked to the dude who rebolted this and he said they barely hold body weight. After the overhang, do some .10 slab moves, and then, belay if you want, or just launch into the 5.6 (at most) patina haul to the top.  Descent: gain the large sloping terrace. Follow it along the base of the wall for about 100-200 feet. Down climb into the bush filled gully.  A climbers trail leads downward through dense brush for several hundred feet. Look right and step up and around a rock prominence and into another gully close to the wall of the climb.  Continue down the climber trail to a horizontal bench about 60 feet above the start of the route.  Either move left and rap of a tree or down climb easy 5th class to reach the base of the climb and your gear.   The descent isn't pretty. You need to scramble back down the canyon that the climb started in (via some 4th-classing climber's right from the summit), the one dividing Black Velvet and Whiskey Peak, but be wary as the canyon forks, as we found out. You'll need to do one short rap of like 70 feet once you get close to your packs. Thanks again to the ASCA, they are really doing climbers a service.","{107894478: 4, 108149490: 4, 107510204: 4, 108327704: 4, 10364: 4, 200226688: 4, 106697740: 4, 107022274: 4, 107325508: 4, 107178013: 4, 108996063: 4, 107748312: 4, 108233563: 4, 111936426: 4, 110851976: 4, 105874611: 4, 111284682: 4, 106441684: 4, 106558490: 4, 105895298: 4, 105805486: 4, 105895326: 4, 105834012: 4, 10168: 4, 200034523: 4, 14771: 4, 12486: 4, 107413532: 4, 12411: 4, 107102882: 4, 107151611: 3, 110315255: 3, 108906506: 3, 106444007: 3, 108843325: 3, 200156593: 3, 110777198: 3, 12258: 3, 14213: 3, 200107185: 3, 110457315: 3, 106838734: 3, 200260358: 3, 106816785: 3, 111602059: 3, 111585366: 3, 108430112: 3, 105829653: 3, 107301514: 3, 105975214: 3, 107329391: 3, 107116841: 3, 13937: 3, 105892598: 3, 106526731: 3, 106615734: 3, 106974860: 3, 106554608: 3, 105790555: 3, 108214070: 3, 108154390: 3, 106506554: 3, 106486112: 3, 107002528: 3, 106958966: 3, 108824777: 3, 105801687: 3, 107562804: 3, 106498277: 3, 107656649: 3, 106216128: 2, 108746269: 2, 106714648: 2, 106201630: 2, 106194019: 2, 105788876: 2, 106441937: 2, 109329350: 2, 106994427: 2, 106999733: 0}"

P1: Climb a left facing corner to a big ledge (5.7, 50').  This pitch could conceivably be combined with the next, but rope drag might be an issue.     P2 (crux): From the left side of the ledge climb the excellent finger crack (aliens work well to protect) over a roof (crux) then continue with 50' of 5.9 hand crack to a bolted belay (this is why you brought all those #2 Camalots). (5.10, 120').  Be sure to save some strength for the hand crack!   P3: A long pitch continues up a steep wall via (mostly thin) cracks and face  and ending at another 2 bolt belay (5.8, 160').  This pitch looks harder than 5.8 from below, and is excellent.   P4: Follow a right facing corner past a pointy detached flake (Caution! Do not touch!) to another nice ledge (with a recently installed 2-bolt anchor) (5.10-, 105').   Two more easier pitches lead to the top, we might have done this as one long pitch.    Descent: From the summit head east, back towards the parking lot.  Scramble down the rightmost of three gullies, and then countour back down to the base of the cliff.  Alternatively,  two 150' raps will take you from the top of pitch 3 to the ground.

Approach from the streambed up a trail just past a house-sized boulder on the right side of the wash.    I'll describe 3 pitches but any two can be combined.    P1 (5.10a, 50'): climb a thin crack just right of a dihedral that leads up to the obvious crack higher up.  The crux comes almost immediately and is well protected.  Step left below an obvious hand-sized crack to belay at a bolted anchor.    P2 (5.10a, 50'): climb the handcrack to a roof.  Instead of following the crack through the roof, traverse right to the next crack and pull through a hard move (5.10a) which is well protected.  A hanging belay just past the crux allows the leader to recover before the next pitch.    P3: (5.8, 110'): climb an excellent hand crack to the top of the pillar.    Both cruxes felt harder than 5.10a to me (this rating comes from the guidebooks) but each was short and well protected.    Rap off the other side of the pillar.  Two 60m ropes will take you all the way down.  An intermediate anchor allows descent with just one rope.

Historical note by Larry DeAngelo:  I was researching history for Red Rock Odyssey at the time of Randal Grandstaff's death in 2002.  His widow, Laura, graciously allowed me to sift through an entire trunk of slides and photographs that Randal had taken.  Among them was a picture of the the striking Cadillac Crack that had been taken in January, 1975.  At the time, Randal was at the beginning of what was to become an illustrious climbing career under the tutelage of local master Joe Herbst.  In light of Joe and Randal's friendship, and Joe's affinity for wide cracks, it is inconceivable to me that they did not climb this route.

A 'cold snap' was predicted for the weekend, and so I made tentative plans with a couple of friends to do Sick for Toys up in Black Velvet. After a slight mishap at work, I managed to mangle my left index finger a bit, leaving me in no condtion to lead .10c slab, so I elected to send my friends on their way to Sick for Toys while I called up another friend to go cruise something easy- after all, it was a weekend to climb sandstone.    Upon our arrival in Black Velvet, we intended to climb Schaeffer's Delight to Lazy Buttress. Yet, while racking up, we spied a gorgeous looking handcrack a ways to the right that was begging to be climbed. My partner seemed up for it, and after thinking it over I agreed- worst case, I have to yard on a piece or two on top rope.     So, off we went and had a great time. We knew it wasn't a first ascent, as there was fixed gear on the route, but after looking around and talking to some folks, no one is talking, so we named it for future parties to enjoy.    The name of the route comes from a microbrewery in Tucson, Arizona that I spent far too much time in while in college.    This route starts about 150' to the right of Lazy Buttress and about 50' left of Crown Royal at the base of a gully system that leads up to an obvious crack in a right-facing dihedral about a ropelength above.

Belay at the base of the crack (two fixed stoppers). 5.7, 180'    Pitch 2: Climb the crack, exiting to the right, then traversing left to a nice stance at the base of another dihedral. 5.8+, 100'    Pitch 3: Head left and up, aiming for an obvious ledge that comes into view after about 15'. This pitch only gains about 40' of height, but traverses about a half of a rope length.

SuperTopo (which refers to this route as ""Unknown Left"") indicates it is also possible to face climb left of the crack.    Above here it is easy but there are a lot of brittle edges that can potentially snap off, plus loose blocks (but you can place lots of gear if you want).  The easiest line is to stay left near a corner, then move back right as it turns into a ramp.  However this is also the loosest option.

It was evident that this “route” has seen little if any traffic in some areas at all.   After much scrambling and some bushwacking to gain the main ledge at the base of the gully we began in some vegetated cracks on the right.

Soon after was a step-across over an immense chasm out of the gully and onto a face of the main ridgeline. For the last couple of pitches we headed up towards the right side of a sub peak, from this point we followed plentiful cairns (or are they called ducks?) up to the summit of Windy Peak.  Note that after reaching the ridge, there are still one or two 4th class moves ascending out of the notch area.  Descent follows the normal hiking descent route from the summit down past the south face.  Although it is possible to descend the east ridge (thus skipping the summit), the route is not obvious, especially if done in the dark.  LarryD summed it up nicely- “It’s not all that sustained, a bunch of class 3 and 4, but long enough to get lost and waste a bunch of time to make the day memorable.”  This description leaves a lot to the imagination, which is the identity and purpose of this route. We explored and found a 2 star route with 3 star exposure, in a 4 star location that offered solitude and adventure.",{107022803: 2}

After some interesting route finding and some exciting leads, we managed to finish the route and now offer it to those who want some good adventure. Although loose rock is present, the climbing is good and protection is decent.    Pitch 1) Start just right of Jubilant Song on the face and head up moderate rock to the large bushy belay ledge.

Belay in a small alcove just to the right of the seond belay on Jubilant Song.    Pitch 3) It is worthwhile to move the belay up to a better position.  Climb up a few feet, then exit left out of the easy chimney to a small belay stance.  Number 4 Camalot gives a good anchor in the crack.    Pitch 4) The headwall above is split by a noticeable thin crack going right up the middle of the face.  Another thin crack lies a few feet to left and angles back to the middle of the face.  The route goes first up, then left to the second crack, then up and right, following the pro to a hanging belay stance a short distance below a dihedral.    Pitch 5) Make a few moves up the soft white rock of the dihedral, then exit right as soon as possible to gain the crack in the dark varnished rock.  This exposed position is directly above the huge Jubilant Song roof.  When the climbing becomes easy, continue up over large blocks to an alcove.  The huge Bandstand Ledge is 30 feet higher over moderate rock.    Pitch 6) Scramble up easy ground until you can make a 4th class switchback to the right and belay on the ledges above.

Belay at a platform on a prominent ramp.Pitch 2 -- Continue up the ramp to belay in the main corner (5.8).Pitch 3 -- Instead of following the corner, climb a tight, left-slanting crack that splits the vertical face above (5.8).  This crack is a key feature of the route, visible from below.Pitches 4-8 -- Two easy pitches go out onto the face to the left.  Thin face climbing (5.8) bypasses a huge bulge on the left.  The final lead goes up obvious rock to the top.Descend via an easy hike.","{12463: 2, 105822976: 2, 106065588: 2, 10589: 1}"

Generously bolted nonetheless. After possibly the most difficult move of this pitch (5.7 or 5.8), the bolt line finishes at a ledge and a big dihedral with mussy hooks on the Left wall and a rad vertical crux on the Right wall.    The belay platform isn't perfectly flat but the rope can easily rest on the ground if positioned with enough care. From here you can hear call signals from the top anchors unless it's quite windy; make a signal plan. Also the routes here are quite condensed, so consider using names before call signals to avoid confusion from other climbers calling on the West end of Armory Wall.    2nd pitch begins with the 5.9 crux wall. Well protected, dead vertical with a few pockets and cracks to work with up to an exit Right of a small roof. Pretty fun! After the crux continue out of the belayer's view at a low angle with a juggy arete Left of the bolt line and various crimps to the Right.    There's about a 10' juggy low angle run out from the last bolt of the 2nd pitch to mussy hooks at the anchor. You can carefully top out here for mind-blowing panoramic view looking into the Carson Valley on one end, just shy of North Lake on the other, and eeeeverything in between.    Rappel down. Coil each end of the rope to throw it down the low angle sections of each pitch for a cleaner rappel. Find the least featured, most straightforward and vertical way down the 1st pitch to avoid snagging the rope when you pull it.   Choose your own adventure:    -Going up   If you want to skip the 1st pitch on the way up and you're a confident 5.8 leader you could consider backpacking the rope to the start of the 2nd pitch by soloing from War Hammer's start through a juggy low angle route toward the vertical bolted crux wall of The Pike. There's one 5.8ish move right below the crux wall before you reach the anchor.    Theoretically, it's possible to start climbing at the start of War Hammer all the way to the anchor of The Pike's 2nd pitch with a 60 meter rope, using your choice of bolts for protection along the way but the trade off would be increased rope drag and less effective communication from top anchors to belay.    -Going down   You can bypass the rappel down the 1st pitch by rappelling from the top anchors to the Amory Wall's ""platform."" Rappelling from the midpoint of a 60 meter rope you can lower to just 5 feet above the start of War Hammer and finish on a short downclimb on great jugs.

Notes for lead First bolt is a little high compared to others in the area, but not cruxy. Because the route wanders and traverses, keep in mind that a lead fall could mean a swing and some bruises; wear a helmet.  Notes for TR Although it's only 6 bolts long, this route takes you through some fun variety. However, it can be an awkward toprope with risk of swinging and crashing into the wonderful features on the rock face here if you don't set up directionals. After leading, consider leaving draws up as directionals and have the second climber top rope from the other end of the rope, cleaning as they go. Or, just pull the rope through and lead it again. Woo!  Rappel down.  Choose your adventure: Consider topping out and getting on the start of Sabre 5.6 or War Hammer 5.8 after completing this route.  Toprope beta: Continue to the climber's Left along the crag and up the not-so-obvious path between the crag and a giant boulder where a tree grows, continue uphill until you can take a Right onto ""the platform."" Once at the start of Sabre 5.6 and War Hammer 5.8 you can step to a low point on the platform. The anchors (quick links) for Space Pants will be below your feet near the edge. Rappel down, setting draws as directionals as you lower for a much improved toprope experience.  History lesson: So what does ""Space Pants"" have to do with castles, medieval times, and the lore of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table?? Nothing! The route setter and affiliates for this fun lead weren't too concerned with staying on theme. ""Space Pants"" have been a big deal lately and are coming back on the scene. Especially in the climbing community these garments are of great value, namely those of the ""leggings"" variety and/or those including kittens.

First bolt is nice and low (and easy to miss). The overhang bolt is the hardest to snag but still good protection and big feet all the way up. Before topping the roof, you can go far right for an easier but run out climb then traverse back in or face climb on the left. The roof would be difficult (5.11) to top straight on and makes this route harder than listed. The crux is between the last bolt and the anchor (as of 2020, the anchor has four hardware store quick links for lower). The anchor was 5.11 on its own unless you go left and take the steps on the side of the face and lean in. Cleaning the anchor required PAS or two short slings to hang from because there's basically no feet. Get ready for a lot of one arm pull ups.  Stay on the route, even when top roping. The rest of this face is very loose (as evidenced by the massive rock slide below you and rock quarry on the ground) and wants to come apart and chuck big rocks at your belayer.

The climb was named H3O because a different form of precipitation was encountered on each of our three attempts.  The route is not on the Main Dome, but is instead located on a formation to the north. It is on the north side of the NE Buttress, aka ""Rocco's Wall"". The climb can be identified by a prominent crack, starting about 75 feet up, that leads up for about two hundred feet, and then leans right for another two or three hundred feet.  All natural gear (except for the pin noted below). I recall doubles of everything up to a #4 Friend, but I’m pretty sure we didn’t have anything larger.  Pitch 1: The pitch to reach the main crack, as originally done, was circuitous. Climb a short ways up a small crack, then traverse to the right to another small crack, and then back left to semi-hanging belay at a flake at the base of the main crack. This was 5.8, but the pitch could be straightened out at about 5.10 or so. We used a pin as part of the belay anchor at the flake, but modern gear should be more than adequate.  Pitch 2: Shallow hand and finger crack (5.10) leads to a belay stance at the base of a spectacular hand crack.  Pitch 3: Hand crack leads to belay where the crack starts to head right (5.9). We went right, but there are variations that could go straight up.  Pitch 4: Climb the right-leaning crack for a long pitch, where a layback leads to a short offwidth section just before a belay at nice stance. (5.11)  Pitch 5 and (probably) Pitch 6: Continue following the crack to the summit ridge of the NE Buttress. (5.9)  The rope may be needed occasionally along the summit ridge.
