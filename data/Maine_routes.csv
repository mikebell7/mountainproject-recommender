But save an hour or two to head out to Great Head to do this incredible pitch.  In contrast to the other sections of the cliff that have committing apporaches, Head Arete has a simple walking approach.  It is somewhat tide dependent though, so pick a low tide window to head over or else the start will be wet.    At low tide, the climb starts just above waterline next to the sketchy traverse that accesses the middle part of the cliff.  Clip the high first bolt, and then make a sketchy mantle manuever to get established on the climb.  The cruxiest move comes at the 2nd bolt, where a powerful lieback gets you on to a beautiful headwall.  The next section is why this climb is so classic:  tricky, thoughtful, sustained 5.10 face climbing in a spectacular setting.  The bolts are never so far apart that you could get seriously hurt, but big whippers are possible.  A cam placement in this section helps with piece of mind.  The great climbing, coupled with the fact that your belayer is out of sight and there is nothing but ocean beneath your feet, is what makes this pitch so memorable.  The finish is harder than it looks, so think about it before committing.    One of the best pitches of trad face climbing anywhere.","{112207022: 4, 107226876: 4, 107377680: 4, 107032446: 4, 108181716: 4, 110454932: 4, 110739544: 4, 111380355: 4, 107169450: 4, 107116332: 4, 110970484: 4, 107118543: 4, 200635915: 4, 106762537: 4, 106425299: 4, 105797861: 4, 106168303: 4, 106775653: 4, 11387: 4, 10315: 4, 106125724: 4, 108082584: 4, 107820617: 4, 14568: 4, 105906559: 3, 106552384: 3, 110398845: 3, 110642863: 3, 107431656: 3, 112070569: 2, 107907042: 2}"

Legion of Decency,111048979,Trad,111048959,5.11,180,1,4.0,4.0,"Legion of Decency is a magnificent, instant mega classic, and an atypical crack climb of Acadia. Parts of this route may have been top roped by earlier explorers after climbing one of the nearby obscure, un-loved, burly, kickass climbs of the Parking Lot Buttress. The route has never seen a lead climber until recently, which is mind boggling because the route is rather jaw dropping when viewed from the ground. Though having a newly cleaned splitter crack system to send off on certainly contributes to its beauty.   A gorgeous right facing corner crack moderated by a splitter in-cut crack on the right leads to a clean slab with bomber finger sized gear in a sweet crack. A short headwall boulder problem with dueling side-pulls gains a beautiful alcove ledge and the beginning of the business.   From here, jam, side pull, and stem hard off the opposing wall, making sure to clip gear long as you have just embarked on a 50m pitch!   This is a wild, exposed, and super steep crack that would be much much harder if the stemming wall did not exist. That said, this route is definitely harder for climbers of minimal lank. Fully stemmed out, it feels amazing to be climbing such a wild pitch so securely!    There is a potential ""death flake"" before the crux but none of us have had to pull on it or place gear in it...  The crux comes as the wall steepens slightly , the left crack becomes more splitter, the right side-pulls become less positive, and the stem which gradually widens must be left behind in order to exit left onto the most incredible ledge in Acadia.   From the small triangular ledge which, looks (on a smaller scale) like it belongs on El Cap. Step right into a tough ringlock crux in a chewy, man-hand creating granite crack that splits the very edge of a vertical to slightly overhanging arete. On its own, the next 40 feet of climbing is one of Acadias purest cracks. But this climb is not over! from the top of the crack step left to a puckering face boulder problem, some scrambly stuff, and finish up the dueling cracks of the Weismuller Route on some of the best rock in the country.","{106406757: 4, 108522460: 4, 200163780: 4, 105906559: 4}"

Ancient Via Ferrata,111006775,Trad,106223480,Easy,400,3,3.0,15.0,"This ""route"" (which is not in the current guidebook) was recommended to me by a world-traveled climber as a ""don't miss"". While most technical climbers could easily solo it, an uncaught slip would certainly be fatal. It is most interestingly climbed with a short rope and about 5-6 long ""alpine draws"". (We used a 50M 8mm doubled over for 80ft, which seemed about right). Unlike maintained Via Ferratas, there are no cables to clip into along the way and the steel rods that do exist are suspect due to age.  START- See ""Location"" for approach. To get to the start of the Via Ferrata continue only another 40-50 ft beyond where the path reaches the Upper Slabs, and then go straight up on talus to the base of a open-book corner of black rock with two iron (steel?) ""L-beams"" overhead [photo], only one of which is still connected on the right side.  P1 - EITHER climb the black corner (5.0 - 5.2) and then exit right by going up between the L-beams [photo],...OR, scramble up the grassy buttress and balance ACROSS the L-Beams! (I have no idea how to rate this!) 30 ft.  P2 - P3 - P4 - P5 [Short ""pitches""] etc. Follow the ""yellow brick road"" (well, actually the brown, rusted iron road) on a long, rising diagonal to the right, placing protection for the follower(s) after any tricky moves. After the last, short 3-4 ft horizontal ladder (there's only one this small) look to continue right for a while, but then cut back left to more open rock (fewer bushes) to the summit.  Descent - Follow the south hiking trail (towards Jordan Pond) off the summit for about 75-100 yds, and then you can cut back to hiker's left and get onto the talus and back to the base of the Ferrata and Upper Slabs. [As part of your approach to the climb, you might consider walking up to this point (it's only about 150-200 ft beyond Upper Slabs) before you do the climb so as to be able to recognize it.]","{109490709: 4, 7062580: 4, 107377680: 4, 106095990: 4, 108310475: 3, 106967283: 3, 200150942: 3, 112207022: 3, 110135505: 3, 110789920: 3, 110642863: 3, 112529638: 2, 107346586: 2, 111610436: 2, 109213362: 2}"

It's close to the harder routes and has good holds but maintains a steep angle throughout it's length.

There are a couple of hard moves before a good hold can be acquired to clip off of after this section.

Expect to use your fingers more than your biceps on this one.","{106047496: 4, 109040038: 4, 200423580: 4, 200063497: 4, 15142: 4, 12525: 4, 110739544: 4, 107764394: 4, 200208307: 4, 112230384: 4, 200096600: 4, 200312793: 3, 109031629: 3, 109467833: 3, 200078875: 3, 200391175: 3, 112207022: 3, 200444805: 3, 200314088: 3, 200116803: 3, 200711420: 3, 200141875: 3, 200793642: 3, 110689679: 3, 106967283: 3, 112028027: 3, 200482542: 3, 105898385: 3, 106646308: 3, 111030282: 3, 111441624: 3, 200316373: 3, 105886022: 3, 108124371: 3, 107141348: 3, 107217576: 3, 107064260: 3, 107394785: 3, 106441684: 3, 106584542: 3, 105895298: 3, 106106734: 3, 106978267: 3, 107942262: 3, 111181604: 3, 106876126: 3, 108437225: 3, 112025952: 3, 200117350: 3, 106538248: 3, 107771837: 3, 110262256: 3, 110737852: 2, 106011053: 2, 10610: 2, 106189019: 2, 200127011: 2, 111488411: 2, 106187478: 2, 106536237: 2, 106054402: 2, 106561728: 2, 106168834: 2, 106720416: 2, 106125724: 2, 111344408: 2}"

(WAB) was bolted by Bob Parrot in '96/'97 and climbs the steep white section of rock to the right of Short Shagg, beginning in the thin band of quartzite-mixed rock that shoots straight up from the bouldery start. Cryptic and acrobatic (as described by Chris Cook), this route is hard to on-sight for 5.12 climbers. Tense climbing with a few possible sucker holds (depending on your height beta) lead to good jugs and a traverse to the right.  Face climb to a big ledge, breath, and prepare for the boulder problem that follows the seam up left, then face climbs to the finish anchors.     This original left variation has only seen 3 ascents-Jim Ewing, Luke Parady, and myself (mumbles of holds breaking and magic ""foot dyno"" beta are frequently heard when referencing this finish). Per Jim Ewing, Luke Parady thought it climbed like a 13a/b, but was probably only 12d. From my personal experience, I would put this upper crux sequence around V9 (or 13c overall). It has thwarted the likes of, yes, Dave Graham, as well as Josh Wharton. Does this mean I'm better than Dave Graham and Josh Wharton? Probably.

The Tenth Degree,113587119,Trad,112284041,5.10c/d,300,4,3.7,3.0,"The Tenth Degree is this crag's signature line.  Although it sees very little traffic, the Tenth Degree is easily one of Maine's best, multi-pitch routes of it's size.  With more publicity and traffic to help clean it up the route will, no doubt, become a destination line for New England climbers.         The Tenth Degree is the obvious, four pitch crack/corner system that runs straight up the cliff's center to it's highest point.  Pitches two and three are the routes real gems.  Although it is likely that no individual move on either pitch is harder than 5.9, the sustained and burly character of both pitches puts them each in the 5.10 realm.  This is one of those climbs that the leader, who will be placing gear under stress, lacking solid stances, will probably find to be a grade harder than the second, who will get the luxury of humming along, enjoying the fine movements on TR.       Pitch One (5.8):  Technically, the route starts right at the base, where the Wavy Wall and Main Wall meet to make a 90 degree corner.  However, the first pitch is almost always wet, overgrown, and blocky.  You can bypass pitch one by doing any route that gets you to the top of the Wavy Wall and then do a short traverse into pitch two.  A good, moderate (but slabby and scary) option to get around pitch one is Wavelength.    If you climb the original pitch one then build a trad anchor on top of the block below the big, corner crack.  If you bypass pitch one via accessing the top of the Wavy Wall, there are three, old pins at the far left corner.           Pitch Two (5.10a):  Climb the blocks to access the off-width corner.  You can stem, using both sides of the buttress for the first four or five moves before the left side vanishes away and the routes turns into a lay-back.  Once you mantle up to a shelf above the corner take a good rest, finish up and left about 20 more feet, over a block to a nice belay shelf and a set of bolted anchors.  If you bring two #3's and two #4's the lay-back corner stitches-up well.  If not, be ready to jog your 4.      Pitch Three (5.10a):  Continue up the obvious corner right off the belay shelf.  The first bolt is a bit far off the deck but the corner will take a #2 about 10 feet up that will protect you while you access the first bolt.  Clipping stances are strenuous and the right wall is lacking good feet.  A #4 protects the mantle move above the pin.  Look up and right, behind the small bush, as you attempt the mantle or you'll wonder how the hell getting onto the slabby shelf is possible.  Once on the slabby shelf traverse left about ten feet, past two bolts, to a new set of bolted anchors.      Pitch Four (5.10c/d):  Pitch Four has a couple options.  The 5.10d options starts right at the anchors; climb the obvious, left trending finger crack into the blocky roof that is about 12 feet off the shelf.  You can bypass this option, making life a little easier, by starting left of the anchors and climbing a dirty ramp that takes you to the top of the blocky roof and is protected by an old bolt.  Either way, above the blocky roof climb on quartz and granite square cut holds until you can access a bolt below the second roof with a v-notch.  Up and over the v-notch roof, and over another block, to a slab and the summit anchors.     Route can be descended in two raps with a 70m rope.  Three to four raps with a 60m rope.   A WORD OF CAUTION:  The top of pitch four, about 20 feet from the anchors, goes over a blocky roof with a sharp edge that could present some real, potential, rope-integrity issues for the second.  I highly suggest mitigating this risk by going into this climb with a fatter rope that has a nice, hardy sheath or by having the leader extend their personal anchor system down to the edge in order to pad it for the belay.  If you do not have a nice, fat, rope or the leader does not have the technical skills to extend down and protect the edge, then I highly suggest calling it quits at the top of pitch three and rappel from there.","{112239538: 4, 107895517: 4, 200115952: 3}"

The Armadillo,106020335,Trad,111173512,5.7,0,1,3.8,72.0,"The Armadillo has just about everything you could hope for in an alpine climb: Chimney climbing, face climbing, crack climbing, ridge climbing, big time exposure, solitude on the route mixed with gawking, awed filled hikers at the top.This route climbs at least 6 pitches of the huge pyramid and ridge in the middle of the south basin to the rim of the mountain, 10 minutes from Baxter Peak.   Expect to get an early start and plan for a long day. The rangers will inspect your gear and require you to bring a #4 camalot, or equivalent cam. You'll need to fill out an itinerary form and leave the camp by 8 am.  The approach is long, and somewhat sketchy. Rock hop around the right side of Chimney pond until you come to the stream bed on the south side (back.) Follow the stream bed (which will have a lot of water after rain) south to the headwall of the basin, at the waterfall which makes up the start of the Ciley Barber route in winter. Skirt the waterfall on the left (in the trees without a rope or via some easy but technical climbing through the rock band.) Cross the stream at another headwall and follow loose wet slabs and vegetation up and to the right until you can access a narrow vegetated ledge which will lead left to the start of the climb. There is a chock stone blocking convenient access on this ledge, which can easily be passed, however it is very exposed and roping up before this point is safe and convenient. Build an anchor below and to the right of the small flake with a pin. Plan for at least 2 hours on the approach but it may take you 3.  Pitch 1, the chimney: From the vegetated ledge clip an old pin on your left and boulder up to the next ledge system, move left to the base of the huge detached flake. Stem, jam and wedge you way up the chimney behind the flake to the second comfortable ledge, about 2/3 of the way up the big flake. (5.5)  Pitch 2, the face: Climb on the fat arete of the flake for about 20 feet (protection can easily be found in the hand crack on the right.) Move left just below an old pin (when you run out of comfortable feet) onto the face of the flake for some very exposed face climbing to the top of the flake. (5.7 PG)  Pitch 3, the bad ass crack: Climb straight up the splitter crack. It starts as big hands and is easily protected with a #3 cam (keep sliding it up with you if you only have one.) Quickly pass a chock stone (red TCU) and climb up to the Bong. Dump the #3 as the crack turns into fist and more and start to protect with a #4 cam (again, slide it up with you if you only have one.) 30 feet or so above the bong the crack widens to 6 inches for a few feet. Soon the climbing eases up and protection can be had with a #9 and #10 nut as well as a #2 cam a little higher. At the top of the crack belay with gear in the 1.5 in range behind a solid flake at a comfortable ledge. Be careful of the loose rock at the top of this pitch. (5.7) WooHoo!  Pitch 4, the corners: From here the quality of climbing changes character. Access a ledge 15 feet above the crack and make progress through a few short dihedrals to the left separated easy climbing and rest ledges. Belay just below the crest of the ridge, or the spine of the Armadillo. Again, be careful of the loose rock. (5.5)  Pitches 5 and 6, the ridge: Climb the ridge to the top, which is basically 4th class hiking with a few 5th class moves. Be careful as most of the rocks are pretty loose. Many people simulclimb the last two pitches.  From the junction of the Armadillo with the knife edge trail you can hike to the summit (Baxter Peak) if you go right (northwest) and then down the Cathedral or Saddle trail. The Saddle trail is much nicer to hike down with your rack and rope in your pack. You can also go left and cross the knife edge and Pamola four/Chimney Peak and then down the Dudley trail.","{200444805: 4, 200342013: 4, 110878800: 4, 5717666: 4, 110409351: 4, 109490709: 4, 108633199: 4, 108222002: 4, 106990659: 4, 111047797: 4, 111657384: 4, 200070164: 4, 108803313: 4, 109884416: 4, 107318184: 4, 110652445: 4, 107615220: 4, 200373952: 4, 200427395: 4, 200426442: 4, 110575515: 4, 200692562: 4, 106403862: 4, 200288533: 4, 110712867: 4, 200228539: 4, 200068872: 4, 200314827: 4, 106285189: 4, 112038160: 4, 107745530: 4, 108323817: 4, 107394785: 4, 107346586: 4, 105889415: 4, 107916193: 4, 106134676: 4, 107100666: 4, 106751248: 4, 10204: 4, 107739229: 4, 107226876: 4, 106412174: 4, 106852549: 4, 106978809: 4, 108124265: 4, 105846471: 4, 105933166: 4, 111787439: 4, 108346136: 4, 110135505: 4, 106410910: 4, 110117203: 4, 106095990: 4, 111541482: 4, 109284031: 4, 109608840: 4, 106883693: 4, 200934973: 3, 109411750: 3, 111769967: 3, 112091216: 3, 110718478: 3, 108426171: 3, 107820617: 3, 111841723: 3, 109105073: 3, 106615429: 3, 105892608: 3, 107469778: 3, 200334316: 3, 111511502: 2}"

I had remembered traversing directly below the huge first chockstone (like maybe I even had to duck in places) and making one or three ""sketchy"" 5.5 (old school) moves to get around its left side. The 2015photo(s) I took looked like there was nothing under the chockstone.Both observations have been confirmed by a recent report on the climb by Robert O'Brian who reported in an e-mail :""I climbed it as a high school student (’72) and remember it the same as you… now we climbed about 60-70 feet down hill from the chockstone itself… I think something washed out the gully. "" His description of the 2019 climb is as follows: A very short technical climb (perhaps 80 ft) with a fair distance bushwack approach and regular short (10-50 ft) class 4 going around chockstones 2-4. We also had to 4th class the small 20 ft headwall beneath the first chockstone. Conditions were wet, but the rock was good and not slimy. The crux is on left side of the 1st chockstone, and had a 20 foot vertical bit that is very well protected (including fixed nut) up to 15 feet, but poorly thereafter (5.6R at the top of the crack, before the angle eases off). You can stem (hard) or wide hand/foot crack (easier) the first 20 feet. The remainder is a long, gradual rising horizontal crack system with vegetation and loose choss (beware to belayer) which meets with the upper left side of the chockstone itself. This upper crack protects poorly and offers both the leader and second a ground fall. 5.6 seems right. 4th class is inappropriate (5.6 solo is still 5.6). Based on the beta from many websites and BSP, it seems like the route is rarely climbed in summer.","{108310475: 2, 106095990: 0}"

We got a good view of P4rv from P4. P4rv was less steep but had way more loose rock. Enough so that you'd be foolish not to stay roped up even on the 4rth class stuff. The chimney is to the right of P4rv and was grungey and loose. P4 had its share of loose rock but held plenty of solid protection placements. Areas to set belay stations were abundant.

The Wrong Chimney,110556519,Trad,111173512,5.5,1200,1,1.0,1.0,"Located to the right of THE Chimney, the ""Wrong Chimney"" provides access to the excellent class 4 / easy class 5 rib between the two chimneys. [NOTE: MtnPrjct member Ryan Gibbs suggests it is highly probable that this is the same gully/chimney as ""False Chimney"" in Rock Wilcox's winter ice climbing guide. ]    Scramble up into this chimney and climb it for about 200-300 feet, looking for an exit wall on the left as the central gully becomes steeper and more narrow, eventually the gully actual ends at a gravelly/poor-rock ""headwall"". [ I think we moved out on P5, but I have no recollection of pitch length, we would have been using a 40m (137 ft) or 150 ft rope.]  The exit wall was the crux ( 5.4 -5.5 ?)     Above the exit wall, the rib (keep a bit to the right, see photo of upper section) provides for pleasant and enjoyable Class 4 / easy Class 5 climbing to the ridge just south of Chimney Peak.     I also think that on another day we climbed THE Chimney, and moved right onto the rib that ends exactly on Chimney Peak.",{108310475: 1}
