Thankfully it feels a bit easier now than that first time!    Start on the obvious left facing flake in the center of the wall.  Make some fun moves up the flake to two crimps then a tougher move to the sidepull (or gaston) and one more tricky move to the top.    And avoid good holds out right for full value.
