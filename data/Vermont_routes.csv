Lowering off this fixed anchor makes this pitch 5.11a with G/PG gear (i.e. the gear is good, but it is tricky to place and it is comprised of tiny pieces).

Continue up the face with a sharp arete for your left hand, (bolts) to an anchor at a good stance. 10a  Pitch 2: Traverse up and right from the anchor, follow bolts to get into a small left facing corner. (crux #1) 2 more bolts gets you to a rest, then into another corner with somewhat finicky gear and ferns that you will probably have to pull out while cruxing. Then mantle up onto a nice big ledge. This is a short pitch. If you are feeling confident, you could easily run p1 and 2 together.   Pitch 3: Head straight up to the top of the cliff, following bolts and gear. This pitch has a ton of variety and is sustained and beautiful. At one point about halfway up you will see bolt up and to the left, don't let that distract you.

P2 5.10a: Locate the second pitch by a short scramble up 4th class terrain and belay right below 2 low bolts in a corner.  Climb the corner and eventually work your way out left onto a face.  Pass more bolts on the face.  At this point you will be very close to the neighboring route, Bum Cakes, and you can link over to this line and go to the Bum Cakes anchor.  Otherwise, continue up on good holds.   Pass a series of cracks and slots placing a couple pieces of gear at good stances.  Turn a slight lip, passing out of sight of your belayer, continue up and to the right on an open slab passing 3more bolts and placing a couple more pieces of gear.  After clipping the last bolt easier terrain gains a ledge with a 2 bolt anchor.   From this anchor two 60 meter ropes are the safest option to get down but you may make it with a single 70m. P3 5.10a:  The third pitch climbs directly above the belay.  Clip the first bolt (glue in wave bolt) and continue to a nice stance where you place a piece of gear.  Continue up past more wave bolts on good holds.  After the 4th bolt a small ramp leads up and right to a ledge.  Place gear off the ledge and work up to a bolt.  Good edges and side pulls get you past 3 more bolts.  Good hand holds and good feet get you to a #2 in a horizontal crack.  Shake out, chalk up and get ready because things are about to get exciting from here.  Crimps and good feet get you up to the last bolt, right below the belay ledge.  A tricky, bouldery, sequence (well protected) gets you up and on to the ledge and a 2 bolt anchor. 3 rappels down from here get you back to the ground.

The fact that this route was put up on lead is humbling to think about as you find yourself hesitating trying to figure out how to get to the next bolt. For the FA team, there wasn't a next bolt.  Even being fully equipped, the route is a good 5.11 for the 5.10 alpine climber and not suitable for an inexperienced party.  (9/2019) This route has been retrobolted by the FA party and has gotten the glorious Gregg Kuchyt treatment. All bolts have been inspected and anything suspect was replaced with high-quality glue-in fixed hardware.   P1 (5.11/5.11-): Clip the first bolt and climb steeply to the base of the roof. Fire out the roof on good holds and then figure out the exit strategy before the gas runs out. Above the roof, moderate face climbing past a few bolts leads to a spacious belay stance on a ledge with a fixed anchor.  P2 (5.10): Move right and climb easily over stacked blocks and cut back left on the high angle ramp to a small roof, a groove, and a bolt. Make a reachy move (harder if short/lacking on reach) into the groove and follow bolts up to a sloping ledge. Step right and climb some fun face trending left to another sloping ledge. Climb up the opposing faces to an awkward step right to a stance, below the ""plated roof"". Trend up then left and out of the roof system to a stance below the vegetated ledge. Make oddly unnerving moves topping out on the vegetated ledge to a fixed anchor in a big block at the front of the vegetated ledge.  P3 (5.10++): Move the belay back on the ledge about 30' at the obvious impacted area. Some enjoyable moderate climbing leads to a stark series of physical mantles and finally a stance. Some more technical face climbing leads to a welcomed slab and a fixed anchor. The rock quality on this pitch takes a turn for the less ideal. There are a few loose plates/flakes/blocks in the vicinity of the route. Climb accordingly.  P4 (5.10-): Gingerly move left off the belay and clip the first bolt. Some easier slab climbing leads to a left-leaning seam that turns into a left-facing corner (crux) under a block.

Alternatively, a shorter first rappel just down the slab will allow you to walk climber's left to reach the top of The Diagonal (where Right Finish started).

With a moderate, all bolted, first pitch; a super fun and interesting second pitch and a high exposure third pitch (with an alternate easier variation) with a short approach from the road, this route is easily destined to be a Smugglers Notch classic!!  Getting There: Located between the starts of The Quartz Crack and The Diagonal; scramble up to the ledge between these two climbs making a few 4th class moves to establish oneself on a ledge with a large block leaning against the cliff. Alternately, climb up pitch 1 of quartz crack and diverge up and right after the second bolt (.75 cam helpful) on the first pitch of Quartz Crack.  Rack: While much of the route is bolted, a light cam rack is useful for pitches 2 & 3. Rack of .3 - 2”. (Light cam rack to #4 for P3 left Vari.).

Quartz Crack,112067933,Trad,112064620,5.9,360,4,3.1,26.0,"This is the namesake route on this wall for good reason — a well deserved classic that comes with a sense of adventure. You'll also be the star of the show all day as tourists gawk up at you from the parking lot.  P1 (5.5, ~60'): Go straight up, past 2 bolts to a nice ledge with a new two bolt rap anchor. It's possible (and I recommend) combining this pitch with the next one.  P2 (5.7, 70'): Move left from the anchor and up an easy corner trending back right almost immediately. Near the end of the pitch, continue up steeper terrain past an old pin or two to another nice ledge and a bolted rap anchor.  P3 (5.8, 95'; 5.6R): Move left off the belay again to the obvious crack. Some tricky pro and 3 ancient pins to get started. You'll pass some white quartz through this section that gives the route its name. After 40', run it out over easier terrain to a right facing corner above and a little left (pretty obvious). There are currently some really old, terrible cord slung around a block in this corner. Don't use it. Continue up to a new two-bolt rap anchor just above, under the roof.  P4 (5.9, 100'): Don't skip this pitch. It's the money in my opinion. Traverse low and right until under a corner system and a terrible bolt that can be backed up with a very small cam. Move up from here, passing more ancient relics (and gear options that you should use) through the crux corner. Expect this to either be wet or mossy. Go all the way up this corner to under a roof. Don't traverse right too early. See                P4, traversing too early.  Don't go this way!  You're supposed to be up about 15 ft. higher into the corner above where this climber is, directly under the massive roof above.       for what not to do! Once under the roof, move right to a good ledge and gear/tree anchor.  P4 Aid Variation / Quartz Crack Roof (5.9 C2, 90'): Probably the best aid climb in all of Vermont, this variation follows a thin seam in the roof that the traditional fourth pitch traverses underneath. Begin the same as P4, climbing up into the corner under the roof and traversing climber's right with hands just below the roof. When you reach a thin seam in the roof, marked by a crack that is flared left and a few pitons that may have been the belay for this pitch, begin directly back onto the roof. Follow that seam through to some smaller cam and possibly nut placements, clipping an old piton and button head, as well as a brand new bolt along the way. Use a combination of aid and free moves to come over the roof, set a gear anchor, and then bushwack straight back about 10 - 15 feet for a climbers trail for the rappel.  The aid pitch is incredibly exposed with about 300 feet of air directly beneath you, and is an incredible experience for anyone who aids (or just wants to do this awesome route).  Interesting to note that the P3 belay and entire climb of this pitch is totally protected from any time of rain the notch can throw at you, which can be a fun experience.  Descent: You can rap from any of the first 3 pitches easily. Once you top out, you'll have to hike climber's right on the Beduin Trail a bit to another rap route. It's a pretty obvious trail that may be marked with orange or pink tape. Find a trail skiers right which leads to a nice ledge with two anchors on it. The one closest to the edge will have rap rings. A single 60m rope will take you to the top of the first pitch of Flight of the Manatee and a second rap gets you to the ground a few hundred feet climber's right of the base of Quartz Crack. Additionally, if you have a tagline or climbed as a group of three, a single-strand rappel with a 60m will get you from the top rappel station to the ground in one rappel. It is a true rope stretcher so tie your knots. Lighter climbers may find themselves tiptoeing the ground, so have the heaviest climber go first to help.","{200675548: 4, 200181052: 4, 112098552: 4, 107727480: 4, 200428404: 4, 111659732: 4, 200350797: 3, 200167098: 3, 113077522: 3, 200374061: 3, 109869056: 3, 106852549: 3, 200394444: 3, 200335317: 3, 107560545: 3, 107549114: 3, 111087111: 3, 110395141: 3, 107941356: 3, 110164339: 3, 200234568: 3, 200070186: 3, 107226876: 3, 109284031: 2, 106743674: 2, 107820617: 2}"

Stand start around the left side of the Second Base roof on good, flat edges. Utilizing flat edges, crimps, and garnet-nubs campus or heel hook your way across the entire front of the Second Base roof. Either pull over and walk off at the end or prepare to grab fistfuls of moss and ferns and top it out like a big boy.

Get a strange scrunched up left foot on a small edge out left. Keeping the foot, contort your body so that you can grab a decent right-hand flake jug at the end of the edge. Once you get that, continue to keep the left foot on and fall into a small ear crimp to the left of the flake jug with your left hand. From there, swing and grab the lip. Switch feet and bump your left hand up higher to a good edge (you will need to tick it so that you can find it). Switch hands on the good edge, stab out left to a sidepull, and then heel hook a huge edge on the left corner of Second Base. From there, throw up to a tips crack just below the second small roof. Lean out and grab small crimps over the small roof. Match, then go up to a good juggy crack and top out on decent but dirty holds.There is a deeper start starting on two horrible nothing-crimps with next to no feet. This should bump it up 1 or 2 V grades.Video: Nosferatu, V11",{106927455: 4}

Work up the prow using holds on the left used for Blackbeard and a pinch on the right-hand side. From there, get good feet and dyno right to a jug on the right side. That is the crux. From the jug, go straight up to two tiny crimps, one for your left hand, and one for your right. The correct feet here make the holds good. From those, slap to the top, the lip is good.
