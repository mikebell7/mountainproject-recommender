From first ascensionist Jonathan Siegrist's description (with permission): ""The climb begins with a pumpy and cool 13a called 'Son of Discovery', before breaking dramatically right as the grips gradually decline to a sequential, powerful and very low percentage mid-height crux. One specific move in this crux thwarted me repeatedly. Pure difficulty was certainly an issue, but mainly it is characterized by an off balance, super accurate and long move. At best I was doing this move 1 of every 3 or 4 times from the hang. Linking it from the ground was going to be a heinous task. A few hard exit moves take you into easier terrain and the main rest. Above the rest, an ultra thin, beautiful headwall, 60 feet or more in length remains. The meat of this section is 2 well spaced bolts long, and requires finger strength, creative thinking and a surprising amount of power. The final bolt is crimpy 12+/13- terrain to the top... pulling up over 40 meters of rope to clip.""  Needless to say, I have not climbed this route! (Nor has anyone else . . . yet.)

A good way to climb this route is to combine the first and last 2 pitches together for 200ft pitches.","{12023: 4, 107629985: 4, 105834456: 4, 106881716: 4, 13486: 4, 105845823: 4, 107022803: 4, 106381795: 4, 10431: 4, 106879015: 4, 107252898: 4, 107201859: 4, 107172572: 4, 106887229: 4, 108010116: 4, 107075506: 4, 107885570: 4, 109521065: 4, 108896064: 4, 109071656: 4, 110190745: 4, 110125608: 4, 106863637: 4, 106681424: 4, 110679371: 4, 200064270: 4, 111210900: 4, 112049062: 4, 7023972: 4, 200160322: 4, 106160132: 4, 112163205: 4, 200275708: 4, 111987917: 4, 200300392: 4, 112002023: 4, 108887503: 4, 112068096: 4, 112002095: 4, 112937123: 4, 112010003: 4, 200272039: 4, 200718126: 4, 200569620: 4, 111404787: 4, 107768989: 4, 106465734: 3, 105801857: 3, 105789759: 3, 105792986: 3, 105888900: 3, 107153125: 3, 12988: 3, 107524531: 3, 7002067: 3, 105868316: 3, 106017451: 3, 106087077: 3, 105973336: 3, 106139972: 3, 106457402: 3, 106492875: 3, 105972105: 3, 106569198: 3, 106747587: 3, 106219552: 3, 107086587: 3, 106268558: 3, 14595: 3, 106053957: 3, 107065373: 3, 107164444: 3, 106989253: 3, 107086434: 3, 106827095: 3, 107147681: 3, 106455998: 3, 108074697: 3, 107721531: 3, 106892709: 3, 10382: 3, 107561676: 3, 108390975: 3, 106077771: 3, 108160697: 3, 105834509: 3, 108711472: 3, 109096310: 3, 109170236: 3, 106045790: 3, 107459332: 3, 107574975: 3, 109135865: 3, 109018419: 3, 106098789: 3, 106013776: 3, 106433124: 3, 107575405: 3, 106753329: 3, 109162529: 3, 108130186: 3, 106386195: 3, 110334222: 3, 110217587: 3, 105823132: 3, 106128017: 3, 110984054: 3, 109174966: 3, 111546551: 3, 107296299: 3, 111909643: 3, 111934866: 3, 105887867: 3, 108762582: 3, 111771193: 3, 111661495: 3, 110745998: 3, 107870857: 3, 112429854: 3, 108113481: 3, 108701734: 3, 200033173: 3, 107773063: 3, 107402621: 3, 111536136: 3, 13115: 3, 112426189: 3, 200070835: 3, 200139139: 3, 113164188: 3, 105934900: 3, 200242030: 3, 200144733: 3, 106065588: 3, 200195323: 3, 110177633: 3, 105897956: 3, 110254579: 3, 110390745: 3, 110702810: 3, 111144995: 3, 200062837: 3, 107691094: 3, 200327695: 3, 200325909: 3, 200299394: 3, 107560585: 3, 200154390: 3, 107230627: 3, 107544688: 3, 109361563: 3, 111674806: 3, 200431381: 3, 108272772: 3, 110944243: 3, 107993865: 3, 111819336: 3, 109884038: 3, 200688678: 3, 200062377: 3, 200208662: 3, 107221655: 3, 107121036: 3, 200636294: 3, 200427290: 3, 109187861: 3, 111072569: 3, 110808746: 3, 10185: 2, 107075180: 2, 105839371: 2, 107324725: 2, 14207: 2, 107755746: 2, 107897621: 2, 106841465: 2, 106881074: 2, 11453: 2, 108318165: 2, 107467696: 2, 107591659: 2, 107709123: 2, 108199044: 2, 108331636: 2, 10270: 2, 106856071: 2, 107226350: 2, 108118179: 2, 108959833: 2, 106631078: 2, 112194341: 2, 111185402: 2, 108252197: 2, 200079207: 2, 109273711: 2, 109171331: 2, 111438952: 2, 108222837: 2, 108308307: 2, 108324975: 1, 106764511: 1}"

Slap and heel hook the arête and pull through a few committing moves to the great clip hold above the crux allowing you to get established in the huge hueco just right of the arête. Take a moment to enjoy the airy and exposed position before making the final moves to the anchor.  According to Bingham's book, the 5.11c crux can be avoided by going far right of the huge hueco near the crux. I didn't try this and think that would be quite a pendulum swing if you didn't make it.

The 11c moves require height and reach.  Move right along the ledge/slab to the right side of the hueco.  Climb the jugs and chicken heads on the right side.

Donini's Crack,105741041,Trad,107577289,5.10c,80,1,2.7,80.0,"This is a classic tough roof crack on the back side of Bath Rock.  Many try this route, but but few succeed. It is probably a little bit of a sandbag.    Start below the obvious roof crack.  You can clip a bolt on Gemini 5.12a near the beginning.  Work up under the roof and fire in some thin hand gear.

Carol's Crack,105741512,Trad,105739810,5.8,100,1,3.0,330.0,"AKA: Double Cracks. This is on the left side of the west face.  It is in deep shade early morning.  It is easy to identify by the closely spaced double cracks that start on top of the large leftward rising ramp.  Scramble up the ramp any way you choose, then jam the fun crack for 50 feet or so until it lowers angle.  No anchor at the top.      To rap, scramble to your right (when facing the cliff) to an anchor.  A one rope rap with a 60m touches down near the ground, where a short scramble off is easy.    The climbing on this is really good, but the upper crack is so short that it is over too quickly!

This is a good route to do if you're feeling a little bored with the usual routes that have good protection.","{107778515: 4, 14537: 4, 108023481: 4, 108351892: 4, 108171708: 4, 109205663: 4, 108797654: 4, 107467696: 4, 108733245: 4, 112016379: 4, 108187175: 4, 110935614: 4, 105842259: 4, 106740382: 4, 107933029: 4, 107878003: 4, 105897956: 4, 111936208: 4, 106722481: 4, 10535: 4, 111987917: 4, 106176200: 4, 109645277: 4, 200196715: 4, 107938599: 4, 106109031: 4, 112379307: 4, 105800489: 4, 107085584: 4, 111284682: 4, 110177984: 4, 107544688: 4, 111989887: 4, 200029054: 4, 107221655: 4, 200446023: 4, 200563905: 4, 200372264: 4, 7004127: 4, 107768989: 4, 200042129: 4, 106210225: 4, 106173169: 4, 108181060: 4, 106766740: 4, 105973336: 4, 200180019: 4, 200173746: 4, 106494476: 3, 107763339: 3, 106146571: 3, 105972105: 3, 105787348: 3, 105981102: 3, 105846944: 3, 108886435: 3, 107643526: 3, 106486749: 3, 106554171: 3, 106830768: 3, 106919775: 3, 107649404: 3, 107870857: 3, 109663521: 3, 110254579: 3, 110649726: 3, 108118179: 3, 108762582: 3, 110984054: 3, 109414386: 3, 107561676: 3, 105792986: 3, 111934866: 3, 11591: 3, 12023: 3, 110879602: 3, 106299537: 3, 109965371: 3, 109587857: 3, 105851792: 3, 106412178: 3, 107314708: 3, 111554934: 3, 111921301: 3, 107643100: 3, 110847522: 3, 105890911: 3, 112252158: 3, 107153125: 3, 109811571: 3, 7100330: 3, 112489276: 3, 111997114: 3, 110424343: 3, 112263554: 3, 109607807: 3, 107528726: 3, 105934900: 3, 111693310: 3, 106959502: 3, 106065588: 3, 11181: 3, 200056018: 3, 108094755: 3, 111952749: 3, 108887503: 3, 200150933: 3, 110606185: 3, 7130796: 3, 13658: 3, 200110921: 3, 111811493: 3, 200276850: 3, 110679371: 3, 106259414: 3, 112340115: 3, 108272772: 3, 108601607: 3, 111920545: 3, 107691094: 3, 108854227: 3, 110869322: 3, 110536605: 3, 200093542: 3, 111859893: 3, 111872966: 3, 200063502: 3, 105832216: 3, 109171331: 3, 200417763: 3, 200480731: 3, 200538483: 3, 106859662: 3, 111120298: 3, 200373966: 3, 200166628: 3, 111925817: 3, 200839993: 3, 110959609: 3, 112511507: 3, 200561159: 3, 107560585: 3, 111903949: 3, 200079207: 3, 107121036: 3, 200200801: 3, 109169663: 3, 110496750: 3, 108478944: 3, 200065874: 3, 200631159: 3, 106098789: 2, 107254662: 2, 108418119: 2, 10769: 2, 109258734: 2, 111661495: 2, 108287757: 2, 107172119: 2, 111078134: 2, 200121241: 2, 106822110: 2, 14568: 2, 200144733: 2, 112194997: 2, 108149490: 2, 111984819: 2, 106168914: 2, 200364704: 2, 108390510: 2, 200448130: 2, 109711410: 2, 108916414: 2, 108031666: 2, 200490053: 2, 111231935: 2, 10369: 2, 108919784: 2, 200747731: 2, 108257678: 2, 107856614: 1}"

It is located near the south end of the wall and can be identified by a large right-slanting undercling flake about 2/3 of the way up the climb.  There are not many protection opportunities for the first 60 feet or so.  I used a small cam in a small vertical crack near the bottom to protect some slab moves before the easy face with large buckets.  This bucketed face leads to horizontal cracks the fun undercling and a runout easy Finish on huge holds.

Although it is not technically difficult, I feel that this route is a  poor choice for beginning climbers, due to the issues listed above.   Enjoyable, but somewhat poorly protected 5.5 difficulty climbing up cracks and chimney leads to the prominent notch, on the Southern portion of the summit ridge. It is a bit dirty, and gritty, but more climber traffic would probably clean it up.  Belay In the notch, just above the chimney. (You will need to build an anchor.)  Descent: downclimb southward and westward along the ridge (perhaps 20meters?) and find a chain anchor above the west portion of the Bloody Fingers Corridor, (which separates the upper and lower Breadloves. A single 60 meter rope rappel will allow you to reach 3rd class terrain. (You might be able to do it with a shorter rope. We happened to use a 60.  I rated it 5.7 because one must downclimb a short section exposed, poorly protected  terrain to reach the rappel anchor. The rock on this portion is clean and solid.

Hard Slab Climbs    Nov 30, 2006 - 06:11pm PT   In the sixties in SLC we had already drunk the Kool-Aid. . .My cousin George climbed the Dorsal Fin with long run outs between chickenheads to drill from. It's still rated 10d. It was my first climb of that sort, when George took me to repeat it in 1967. I just thought it must be normal. I also really enjoyed the need for concentration and steady nerves. . . Probably the hardest slab climb in the country in those days was my brother, Greg's route, Infinite, in the City of Rocks. Infinite had lots of 5.10 spice climbing, and a 5.11c crux fully 30 feet above the last 1/4"" bolt. Kim Miller made the second ascent in the mid 'seventies and I repeated it afterwards.

I gave it a low grade because of the guano and because the neighboring climbs are so much better.    Start in the next crack system right of Crack of Doom, below a thin crack in a corner/groove which becomes a chimney.    To start either traverse in from the left (easier) or go straight up to access the crack, the first 20' of which are the surprisingly hard crux.  Above that, continue with chimneying.  After the crack ends, diagonal left for the COD anchors.

Make a difficult move to a layback (crux) which gains a very thin insecure crack.,"{106494476: 4, 105865653: 4, 106102123: 4, 108538771: 4, 109143278: 4, 112340115: 4, 107813192: 4, 108220701: 4, 108031666: 4, 110244087: 4, 11509: 4, 109329350: 4, 107111603: 4, 109117485: 4, 200226688: 4, 11337: 4, 105846730: 4, 112252158: 4, 107068073: 4, 106881716: 4, 105878950: 4, 105836955: 4, 10380: 4, 107240862: 4, 10168: 4, 107329391: 4, 105813161: 4, 106558409: 4, 111835329: 4, 107099407: 4, 109467833: 3, 106035421: 3, 106510314: 3, 200079207: 3, 109807856: 3, 106058125: 3, 10405: 3, 112200512: 3, 106219564: 2, 107882563: 2}"

Inspiration or Perspiration,109166242,Sport,107590276,5.12b,100,1,2.6,8.0,"A long and varied route! Boyle certainly had an eye for the odd! Or was it just that the obvious plums had already been plucked? Powerful and tricky moves down low on a grainy and lichen covered slab give way to a taxing undercling sequence about a third of the way up. A short section of tricky face climbing with great patina crimps set you up on a long gritty, lichen covered slab with spaced out bolts (supplemental gear- see protection section). Finally, above the slab you get to the goods- overhanging granite huecos! Underclings, slopers, delicate stems and sneaky crack climbing skills are needed for this enduro finale. A very airy and pumpy finish! 12a power down low, and 12b endurance at the top. Many bolts are poorly placed in difficult to clip locations... as far as I can tell this is the timestamp of the early Boyle routes.","{200640140: 4, 106058125: 3, 10168: 3, 106881716: 3, 108538771: 3, 108031666: 3, 200079207: 2, 200051315: 0}"

It is found on the north east side of Parking Lot rock, just east of Cario (5.11a).     The climb starts in a right facing dihedral, and follows a juggy crack with good gear.  A small bulge is pulled and the crux finger crack is just above.  Figure out the tricky moves along a finger crack and you will arrive at a ledge with 2 bolts.

The initial crack protects well and climbs easy, until you reach the horizontal crack.  Place a cam in this crack and angle or traverse right.  Aim for the crack just left of the roof.  This crack takes hand jams like it was designes for them, and then turns vertical.  It still takes the hand jams for a distance then thins out into 2 thin cracks.  Take your pick, or use both and pop up onto the face.

Very straight-forward climbing with only the odd technical move thrown in.,"{10681: 4, 11656: 4, 106494476: 4, 105787348: 4, 107349767: 4, 107568149: 4, 107347295: 4, 105789759: 4, 106808483: 4, 105805486: 4, 106491538: 4, 106740477: 4, 106703972: 4, 105943245: 4, 107302652: 4, 105788216: 4, 109227367: 4, 109335950: 4, 107277139: 4, 105802830: 4, 107709123: 4, 109180284: 4, 109162529: 4, 105829717: 4, 107643100: 4, 107803888: 4, 110967113: 4, 111744983: 4, 108074697: 4, 109185368: 4, 200372264: 4, 105788084: 4, 110680880: 4, 107561345: 3, 105787222: 3, 105794408: 3, 106465734: 3, 105809872: 3, 105801857: 3, 105826001: 3, 107288802: 3, 10185: 3, 105853250: 3, 15116: 3, 107621794: 3, 107468926: 3, 107153125: 3, 10232: 3, 105806399: 3, 105975226: 3, 107099202: 3, 13318: 3, 107754093: 3, 106022986: 3, 106763463: 3, 105914510: 3, 105976573: 3, 106830645: 3, 105822848: 3, 106487856: 3, 107658812: 3, 10481: 3, 106163972: 3, 106091716: 3, 105868316: 3, 106299993: 3, 106049619: 3, 106881716: 3, 105801316: 3, 107850248: 3, 106175784: 3, 106215502: 3, 106160164: 3, 106445857: 3, 106057864: 3, 105927097: 3, 106544899: 3, 12522: 3, 106550175: 3, 105834509: 3, 11622: 3, 105792600: 3, 105846944: 3, 106069304: 3, 106867904: 3, 106751248: 3, 106985591: 3, 105972105: 3, 106799524: 3, 105973336: 3, 106303469: 3, 107086587: 3, 12690: 3, 11453: 3, 107763339: 3, 107162820: 3, 107296299: 3, 105842259: 3, 106098789: 3, 107531774: 3, 106268558: 3, 108010116: 3, 107475857: 3, 106013776: 3, 106484179: 3, 109124792: 3, 108853356: 3, 109389485: 3, 108661567: 3, 108982544: 3, 10270: 3, 108199044: 3, 110254579: 3, 108270440: 3, 107591659: 3, 109087554: 3, 108988630: 3, 108118179: 3, 108797654: 3, 105936209: 3, 108171708: 3, 106823389: 3, 108348917: 3, 106398311: 3, 107347938: 3, 108394578: 3, 109541594: 3, 109607807: 3, 106512094: 3, 107397807: 3, 107755397: 3, 110900723: 3, 110755607: 3, 107561676: 3, 106241653: 3, 108418119: 3, 110103936: 3, 108370856: 3, 111934866: 3, 11591: 3, 108187175: 3, 107561580: 3, 111976387: 3, 110052498: 3, 107847782: 3, 112429854: 3, 107528726: 3, 107447299: 3, 110369169: 3, 111693310: 3, 111144995: 3, 106740382: 3, 111120298: 3, 105890911: 3, 13115: 3, 200051315: 3, 110190567: 3, 111997114: 3, 110984054: 3, 106822110: 3, 113459339: 3, 14568: 3, 200139139: 3, 110353558: 3, 200113782: 3, 200110921: 3, 110536605: 3, 107870857: 3, 108149490: 3, 106486749: 3, 106065588: 3, 107285639: 3, 200144733: 3, 106493154: 3, 113097645: 3, 106176200: 3, 109624383: 3, 12023: 3, 200150933: 3, 111819336: 3, 112482952: 3, 112379987: 3, 106029651: 3, 200167473: 3, 112340115: 3, 109495327: 3, 200098252: 3, 200154390: 3, 200062837: 3, 107777498: 3, 108392797: 3, 110392880: 3, 109414386: 3, 108272772: 3, 200173928: 3, 106433124: 3, 107102882: 3, 200069758: 3, 200005308: 3, 10535: 3, 200192115: 3, 200417763: 3, 200166628: 3, 11181: 3, 107665701: 3, 200576323: 3, 200130009: 3, 110021377: 3, 112511507: 3, 200396729: 3, 200561159: 3, 200200801: 3, 108193458: 3, 112400297: 3, 110496750: 3, 108478944: 3, 112412896: 3, 200173746: 3, 108221751: 3, 106959502: 3, 108257678: 3, 13235: 2, 106555309: 2, 106604572: 2, 107116332: 2, 12448: 2, 12988: 2, 106020445: 2, 106874511: 2, 107630669: 2, 106443331: 2, 107217541: 2, 106805249: 2, 15023: 2, 106219564: 2, 106789486: 2, 105904743: 2, 10788: 2, 10380: 2, 106856057: 2, 105865653: 2, 106253603: 2, 107065373: 2, 105823132: 2, 108116958: 2, 107147681: 2, 107778515: 2, 106486112: 2, 105964643: 2, 10168: 2, 108392954: 2, 107022474: 2, 107643526: 2, 107768941: 2, 107819943: 2, 107325943: 2, 108196247: 2, 107467696: 2, 107172119: 2, 106141226: 2, 110568606: 2, 108023481: 2, 106631078: 2, 107342926: 2, 107620610: 2, 109423410: 2, 105934900: 2, 109653110: 2, 107606034: 2, 107638654: 2, 109363594: 2, 107241359: 2, 200143409: 2, 111950751: 2, 105851792: 2, 112263554: 2, 109218898: 2, 110390745: 2, 109385742: 2, 110152429: 2, 111952749: 2, 13658: 2, 110531951: 2, 109171331: 2, 200173290: 2, 200123269: 2, 109973071: 2, 111231935: 2, 106662918: 2, 107314708: 2, 109587361: 2, 105787493: 1, 107230627: 1, 108711472: 1, 105807147: 1, 108446880: 1, 111872966: 1, 200215900: 1, 108155086: 0}"

I cant really do the fully true splits either- but this climb probably requires you are able to get close to it (Im 5ft 9in tall). The thing that makes this climb such a good sport route it you have to climb some really powerful underclings at the start(25 feet)and then without a rest or as much as a jib for a foot you execue a precise, unique, and powerful boulder problem that leads to some rests higher up and excellent thin face climbing for a finish. It is better than Spuds in the Gym because it shares the awesome start, and finishes with more interesting climbing. I think the flexiblity rumour has kept many potential senders from trying it- hopefully this sets the record straight.     It would be wise to protect the start with a small nut (backclean it after clipping the first bolt), and then put runners on each of the first 4 bolts.

First time I climbed this we missed it completely and ended up FS'ing it up to the 1st anchors without realizing we had missed it.","{107022803: 4, 107075029: 4, 105972105: 4, 107153125: 4, 107167007: 4, 107186614: 4, 107252898: 4, 106077771: 4, 106892709: 4, 107631686: 4, 108711472: 4, 109627287: 4, 106558554: 4, 109805268: 4, 108348917: 4, 107737478: 4, 11179: 4, 109071656: 4, 110967113: 4, 109443890: 4, 109167471: 4, 111921301: 4, 111546551: 4, 107813192: 4, 200064270: 4, 111210900: 4, 111137975: 4, 105823132: 4, 112379307: 4, 110679371: 4, 112269428: 4, 108438366: 4, 200420138: 4, 107691094: 4, 108193458: 4, 200469042: 4, 200496835: 4, 112002095: 4, 110959609: 4, 200192211: 4, 10168: 4, 200548012: 4, 111072569: 4, 106555309: 3, 105972853: 3, 12023: 3, 106764511: 3, 105801857: 3, 107628107: 3, 107468926: 3, 105814383: 3, 12988: 3, 105934987: 3, 107718115: 3, 12237: 3, 105973336: 3, 105829132: 3, 106039240: 3, 107015796: 3, 106083305: 3, 105963600: 3, 106544899: 3, 106512094: 3, 106118851: 3, 106569527: 3, 14595: 3, 106303469: 3, 107086587: 3, 106585210: 3, 106523837: 3, 106827095: 3, 105865653: 3, 107201859: 3, 11453: 3, 106544694: 3, 107147681: 3, 108146355: 3, 105831695: 3, 107917913: 3, 110248120: 3, 107616694: 3, 108390975: 3, 106874511: 3, 108023226: 3, 108199044: 3, 108972019: 3, 107561676: 3, 107250964: 3, 106919775: 3, 107499704: 3, 107636562: 3, 12522: 3, 109180284: 3, 106927957: 3, 109205663: 3, 107798616: 3, 107819943: 3, 110152299: 3, 106789486: 3, 109087554: 3, 109162529: 3, 106443331: 3, 107226350: 3, 109334029: 3, 106610639: 3, 108853528: 3, 107742336: 3, 110544219: 3, 109014223: 3, 110896657: 3, 110190745: 3, 111237059: 3, 108762582: 3, 106383866: 3, 110531951: 3, 107658812: 3, 110755607: 3, 109414386: 3, 107070156: 3, 111909643: 3, 110173063: 3, 109017144: 3, 106486749: 3, 108418119: 3, 109143278: 3, 110553136: 3, 107698892: 3, 112016379: 3, 106564832: 3, 110745998: 3, 109600107: 3, 109541594: 3, 109256758: 3, 109277025: 3, 106210225: 3, 105980469: 3, 200061629: 3, 111693310: 3, 111947649: 3, 111995529: 3, 111328351: 3, 112421798: 3, 11622: 3, 112252158: 3, 110496750: 3, 200029855: 3, 111997114: 3, 107241359: 3, 110390745: 3, 111950751: 3, 200070835: 3, 112317813: 3, 107320168: 3, 200074913: 3, 110469888: 3, 105897956: 3, 112010398: 3, 112042073: 3, 112340115: 3, 200178143: 3, 110851354: 3, 105984892: 3, 200276850: 3, 111991481: 3, 105976663: 3, 111987917: 3, 106065588: 3, 200208237: 3, 105888900: 3, 110227681: 3, 111976730: 3, 108887503: 3, 111153248: 3, 200377538: 3, 106646308: 3, 108272772: 3, 108177328: 3, 107606034: 3, 200062837: 3, 110315897: 3, 106772726: 3, 112337532: 3, 200489777: 3, 200299394: 3, 110177984: 3, 109049235: 3, 110940145: 3, 111635077: 3, 111859893: 3, 200093542: 3, 200030605: 3, 200219044: 3, 200146679: 3, 200069758: 3, 111917976: 3, 108031666: 3, 200062377: 3, 200481956: 3, 106487856: 3, 112207296: 3, 111261283: 3, 200422193: 3, 200119503: 3, 200451434: 3, 200192115: 3, 200636294: 3, 200417763: 3, 200166628: 3, 200053528: 3, 200196715: 3, 200389676: 3, 112153722: 3, 200464956: 3, 112325089: 3, 200154390: 3, 108932097: 3, 108478944: 3, 200107185: 3, 106415391: 3, 200173746: 3, 200330485: 3, 109212068: 3, 106999814: 3, 11178: 3, 200079207: 3, 200561159: 3, 11656: 2, 10393: 2, 106604572: 2, 106022986: 2, 105839371: 2, 107325943: 2, 107136096: 2, 105887867: 2, 106088454: 2, 106747587: 2, 14330: 2, 106761693: 2, 107778515: 2, 107248652: 2, 107240862: 2, 105842259: 2, 106794436: 2, 107721531: 2, 108074697: 2, 106457402: 2, 108171708: 2, 107870857: 2, 107022474: 2, 108351531: 2, 107689423: 2, 108171889: 2, 108959833: 2, 109152722: 2, 107731099: 2, 108118179: 2, 110637882: 2, 109288810: 2, 110319826: 2, 107589858: 2, 108182773: 2, 106268558: 2, 109659244: 2, 108766448: 2, 111492521: 2, 108187175: 2, 112087099: 2, 108692836: 2, 107755397: 2, 107693628: 2, 111100482: 2, 106763463: 2, 111640332: 2, 108701734: 2, 105874611: 2, 200051315: 2, 200029244: 2, 107221655: 2, 112890806: 2, 108149490: 2, 111962772: 2, 106232467: 2, 10535: 2, 108576301: 2, 111445592: 2, 111952749: 2, 109011421: 2, 7091916: 2, 108113481: 2, 111415956: 2, 200042129: 2, 110869322: 2, 200437181: 2, 112320574: 2, 200384191: 2, 107560585: 2, 108119334: 2, 200557578: 2, 200448130: 2, 111972920: 2, 200216652: 2, 200236037: 2, 200369846: 2, 110728916: 2, 200744301: 2, 108396145: 2, 200563905: 2, 200576323: 2, 200559854: 2, 200407762: 2, 111821256: 2, 107951180: 2, 200296809: 2, 111759217: 2, 111903631: 2, 200602987: 2, 200173949: 2, 105889270: 2, 200138607: 2, 10246: 1, 105787348: 1, 107217541: 1, 107431114: 1, 108733245: 1, 106494698: 1, 112263554: 1, 111438952: 1, 200325780: 1, 106894727: 0}"

Southern Arches,107170217,Trad,105739629,5.8+,850,4,2.7,15.0,"When looking at a topo photo of Steinfell's Dome, the Southern Arches route is likely to stick out the most because it goes from the toe of the dome to the summit in a nice, direct line. The climbing is adventurous with only one old button head bolt as the only fixed gear on the route and easy but run-out slab climbing on the first pitch. Be prepared to do a fair bit of route finding and build your own anchors. This is a fun and rewarding outing on one of the City's most prominent formations. To keep the adventurous spirit of the route, consider stopping reading here and going out to pick your way up this line on intuition. But if you want a few more details, read on.  Pitch 1: Start from a small ledge directly below a steep, moss covered crack and flake and pull up through this to get established on the dome. Work your way up slabby sections between obvious cracks and flakes for protection to a big, obvious left-trending crack/trough. Your eventual goal is the big sideways ""V"" flake about half way up the dome. Head towards that and run out your 70m rope to a good belay stance in the trough about 60m below the big sideways ""V"" flake. 70m (5.8)  Pitch 2: Continue up the trough/crack and onto a small ledge. Work up past another flake and crack just below the big sideways V flake. Clip the only piece of fixed protection on the route, an ancient buttonhead bolt and hanger, on the face below the big V flake. Make the crux moves up the face to grab the big V flake and take a sigh of relief (#3 cam). Trend right along this flake and mantle up on top of continue. Cruise the flake's left-trending trough to a belay stance at its top in a baby alcove. 70m. (5.8+)  Pitch 3: Climb around the corner bulge of the alcove to the left and onto a face resist the temptation to continue left into the chimney. Instead, face climb back right up steep but positive terrain and pull up onto lower-angle terrain. Follow a good crack on increasingly easier terrain until the rope runs out at a massive ledge. 70m.

It climbs the spine facing the road in 4 pitches.  Find the trail that leads towards Steinfell's, and traverse leftwards on trail to reach this subsidiary formation (called Jackson's Thumb).    The climbing is fun, low angled, and very well protected. If you are a little low on quickdraws, there are some spots where you can unclip a bolt at your knees after reaching for the next clip. The view of the City from the top is great.    One rope is all that is necessary, and the descent is very easy.  Two one-rope raps (we had a 60m, not sure if a shorter rope would work?) from fixed stations get you to a major gully.

Many, if not all, bolts have been removed from the Twin Sisters formations and climbing on them is illegal. Do not attempt to climb these routes for your own safety and compliance with the law!    This long, lost adventure route is undoubtedly a City classic that weaves a very unlikely path through natural features and threatening roof systems at a reasonably moderate grade. Surely covered in lichen thanks to lack of traffic, climbers, hikers, and vehicle-bound gawkers alike will gaze to or from this climb and feel as if they have been transported back in time to the late 1800's... Is that a wagon train west-bound on the California Trail? Alas no, it is an SUV speeding along the dirt road. Are those settlers in search of land, fortune, and fresh beginnings? Alas, no, those are telephone poles and grazing cattle. What is that glint high up on the wall above you? Could it be an exposed vein of gold? One thing's for sure: It's definitely not a bolt.    P1 (5.9, 130'): Scramble (5.7?) up boulders to gain a belay beneath the obvious, clean handcrack just left of a pillar on the easternmost buttress of the formation. Follow this crack until it peters out beneath a bulge and traverse right underneath this bulge to gain a second, hidden crack system. An ancient bolt once and perhaps still does ""protect"" this thin traverse. Continue more easily to a belay at a spike atop the pillar. There was once a bolted anchor here but rumor has it it's been removed.    P2 (5.10w is for weird, 80'): It would be real bummer about that missing bolted anchor because this pitch traverses straight right off the belay for 30' before heading straight up for another 30' to a crux roof; the missing anchor would make this situation very difficult for the belayer to provide a good belay for the leader should he or she fall at the roof. And unfortunately protection post-traverse isn't really ideal for setting up what would be a hanging belay out right. Nevertheless, your goal is the giant, chute-like roof. The climbing up to it is scantily protected, but once there good pro is available: at one time there were two decent pins under the roof, but they could possibly be backed up with supplemental gear (though be careful not to occupy a crucial crimp/slot). I've heard that funky, funky moves that seem extremely improbable pull this roof at what might be 5.10c. Upon turning the lip, build a belay at a sloping stance just beneath a striking rattly finger crack below another blocky roof overhead.    P3 (5.10d, 100'): Climb the rattly finger crack to a wide crack to an awkward hand crack through this final roof (crux). Continue more easily up jugs and incuts to the summit.    If there are no anchors on the summit you might have to leave gear, sling a horn, or simply down climb the southern shoulder of the formation (at 5.5 X). There was once an intermediate anchor halfway down this which would allow for a final rappel to the notch between the North and South Sister, though the rappel would be about 40 meters long.     All my info comes second-hand so I cannot vouch for it's accuracy, but I will say this: There is no hope of rescue here; you're on your own.",{10168: 4}

A second crack appears just below the roof, but continue up the righthand crack at 5.9 (the splitter through the roof is somewhat contrived 5.10). A brief section of burliness gives way to more enjoyable climbing up the twin cracks. A second pitch supposedly continues onto the south shoulder of North Twin Sister, but it would be very easy to traverse straight right on a large dike/ledge system to the anchors atop Straight Edge if they still existed.

The corner requires stemming and lie-backing up cracks and huecos and presents one powerful section before allowing for a rest on a sloping ledge about 35 feet up. Bolt placement seemed less than ideal to me in this corner. After a rest on the sloping ledge, a steep bulge awaits. This bulge can be cheated around, but, that's cheating. Above the bulge is the true crux of the route- a powerful section requiring big moves to hidden holds. Above the crux, the rock gets a bit grainy, and the finish follows a really cool dike feature to the chains- endurance is likely required to hold it together for the redpoint.","{106006184: 3, 106058125: 2}"

Keep towards the left as you get to the top, staying on the left side of the protruding diving board above.    The route is somewhere in the range of 100-110 feet. Top roping is not advised due to the poor position of the single-bolt anchor relative to the top-out of the route.    Be careful pulling your rope. The way the single bolt anchor is positioned on top of the formation makes it incredibly easy to get your rope pinched and cemented in. When we arrived at the route there was a rope hanging down the line that looked pretty haggard and wouldn't pull from the bottom.","{107591659: 4, 106000741: 4, 107102882: 4, 106065588: 4, 107397807: 4, 109743530: 4, 12023: 4, 106272028: 4, 106130589: 4, 106789486: 4, 107468926: 4, 10185: 4, 12690: 4, 105834509: 4, 107715396: 3, 107755397: 3, 106098789: 3, 109541594: 3, 106443331: 3, 108222719: 3, 108142594: 3, 107116332: 3, 105934900: 2, 106874511: 2}"

Closer inspection revealed a fun ridge scramble! This ridge climbs toward the summit of Mack/Numnut Peak. It is perfect for testing new approach shoes or alpine training.The highlight of the ridge (first two sections) is 1000 feet long and gains 500 feet. With an average slope of 45 degrees. Exposure on the ridge is mostly minimal, but there are some spicy sections. Opportunities abound to hop on and off the ridge. Various ways exist to climb the ridge, creating a custom adventure from 3rd class to easy 5th class.Route:First section: Rock Fin The beginning of the ridge starts at an intersecting creek bed. This first section is steep, fun, and ends shortly after a rock fin.  Second section: Towers The second section contains several distinct towers, offering the cruxes of the route. An unmistakable White Pinnacle ""The Flaming Sword"" is found during this section. This is the most engaging and exposed section. There is a rock cairn marking the end of this section.  Third section: Discontinuous Wrap-up After the towers the ridge become discontinuous and less steep. You can hike a wandering animal trail or do an occasional third class problem.  Once you have topped out the ridge you can continue to the summit of Mack/Numnut Peak, or run down one of the various ridges. Either way it's a great workout with an alpine rock feel.  I first summited the ridge at sunrise, hence the name: “Till Dawn Ridge.""

Pitch 2: Continue up above bolted belay, clipping ~4 bolts, and then work your way up the wide crack on the left. I wouldn't have minded having a #5 to protect the offwidth, but if you're solid on wide climbing you'll find it pretty secure and easy. As you climb up the crack, it gets thinner and eventually peters out, at which point you transfer right to another crack which leads to the summit.

With a strenuous and resistant start, gentle overhang, roof, and steep headwall, you will need plenty of endurance.  Begin on a section of steep draining drilled pockets for a few bolts.  The angle lessons but continuous movement makes you keep momentum until you hit a large flat jug.  The first real crux is figuring out how on earth you are supposed to get your feet on said jug.  Good luck.      Fun moves lead up to the juggy roof and although the holds are good, it is steep! Above the roof the angle lessons and you are gifted with a huge flat (although fairly sharp) jug.  Rest well here because the real crux is above.      After exiting the rest you eventually move up to a small incut crimp for both hands.  Clip and launch into the slightly runout crux sequence which revolves around a sloping sidupull and a big move to a pinch.  Some airy fall potential provides enough motivation to try a little harder here.  Clip the last bolt and battle a few small crimps to the glory jug at the chains!    The route was originally named ""Boo"" because of a large tree that I guess you would fall into when you took the big whip off the upper crux.  It was scary so...BOO!","{106870964: 4, 108597121: 4}"
