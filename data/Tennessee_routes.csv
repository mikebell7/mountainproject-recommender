Not to mention what could go wrong if his belayer is not up to snuff. Why, today I looked up to see a roof of rock about 40 feet above with a crack splitting across it for damn near 20 feet. And guess what else I saw? A man! Arms and legs buried deep in the crack, suspended upside down like a sloth to a branch. Albeit with more agility and strength.

Little Tokyo,115364009,Sport,112806356,5.13d,70,1,4.0,2.0,"Smack dab in the middle of the wall lies some of Buffet's best rock, one of Denny's hardest, and one of Chattanooga's best hard lines. Let me tell you a little about this gem of a rock climb.  The first thing you should know is that if you can climb the grade, this is a must do. The climbing style is unique for the area, the climbing is amazing, and it's one of the best.  The second thing you should know is a little about its history. This badass route was bolted by Chattanooga stone man John Dorough during the height of Denny Cove development in early 2011. During this same season, Buffet classics such as Magic Meat, Dalai Lama, Home Cooked, Trichinosis, Mighty Quinn, Meat and Three, and really, every single other sport climb on the Buffet wall were established by the legendary Chattanooga developers John Dorough, Cody Averbeck, Stephen Farmer, Edward Yates, and Dave Wilson. At the tail end of this era in Buffet development Zach Lesch-Huey, Laban Swafford, Brent McDaniel, and Jonathan Brandt added such classics including All You Can Eat and Kids Eat Free. During this time period, first ascents were going up left and right. Some routes were flashed, some took days, and some took the season but through it all, Little Tokyo would not fall.  For months, Laban Swafford and Jonathan Brandt would swap burns at the end of the day attempting the moves with lofty aspirations of sending Denny's crown jewel. Moves, sequences, and bolts of climbing would surrender to their efforts but it wasn't until the South's prodigal son, Ronnie Jenkins, returned for a visit that the crux move would finally fall - an elevator door move involving a one pad, three-finger, right hand gaston and a high left foot to a left hand gaston edge high above and behind the right hand. Thought to be a V9 move in isolation, Laban and Jonathan desperately tried to share in Ronnie's isolated success but to no avail. Little Tokyo would not yield!  Seasons flew by and Little Tokyo saw little attention beyond the duo's whole-hearted but half-juiced attempts at small links. Draws faded, cobwebs grew, and dreams of sending dissolved until the country's largest climbing fundraising event in the country's largest indoor gym kindled a flame and one individual proved worthy.  On February 23, 2013 local climber Tyler Willcutt attended the Rock n' Rave event at Stone Summit Climbing Gym in Atlanta, GA. Over the years, the event drew in big names such as Sasha Digulian, Dave Graham, and Tommy Caldwell but at the very first event, Chris Sharma himself graced the South with his presence. ""What does this have to do with Little Tokyo?"", you may ask. Actually, it has everything to do with Little Tokyo.  On February 24, 2013, the day after Rock n' Rave, Tyler Wilcutt was visiting Denny Cove for the first time with Laban Swafford. The pair warmed up and Laban gave a burn on the Little Tokyo. Tyler asked Laban if he could give it a try. While Laban had put a great amount of effort into Little Tokyo, it wasn't his route to close so of course Laban obliged and Tyler took off on his first attempt of the project. Well, Tyler looked like shit on it. Cruxes that felt easy to Laban felt impossible to Tyler and very few links were made. Tyler lowered with no expectations and a whole host of new opinions on the difficulty and quality of this route. It was hard, and it was awesome. When it came time for Tyler to climb again, he asked Laban if he could give it another go. Seeing as how his first go was a total turd of an attempt, Laban had absolutely no issue...but there was one thing Laban didn't know.  When Tyler left the ground for his second attempt on Little Tokyo, he was in a very different mindset than any he had been in before. See, it was rumored that Sharma would be visiting Denny cove the day after his trip to Atlanta. What would you do with this information? Well, Tyler took it and said to himself ""If I'm on route and Chris Sharma walks around the corner, I better be trying my ass off."" Would you be okay with Sharma standing at the base of your project watching you half-ass your way through all the moves? Nope, and neither was Tyler. Now, it's totally ridiculous to think that the most legendary figure in climbing history would ever show up to the choss-fest that is the Buffet Wall, but Tyler didn't know that. He launched onto the route with more Dura than he ever had given any route before.  Fast forward a few minutes and Tyler is back on the ground next to Laban. Both of them in utter disbelief. Tyler had just sent second go. He hadn't even done all the moves the first time. WTF. Both of them were shocked. The power of the Dura is real. Little Tokyo was complete.  And there you have it, the story of the first ascent. In the seasons that followed, the route was repeated only a couple times by climbers Brion Voges and Jonathan Brandt. Now it's 2018 and in the past season or two Little Tokyo has seen numerous ascents including its First Female Ascent by Kim Shelton and is earning its well-deserved reputation as one of the best in Chattanooga.  Regarding the breakdown, it's nearly impossible to talk beta, grades, or cruxes with fellow climbers since they all vary wildly depending on who you ask. The route begins with 20 or so feet of 5.12+ climbing to a jug. From there, you launch into three stacked boulder problems (one crimpy, one powerful, one tricky) that culminate in 5.11+ climbing to the chains. Opinions on the difficulty of each of these boulder problems range from V5-V8 depending on who you ask. Originally thought to be 5.14a by Laban and Jonathan, Tyler's ascent dubbed the route 13c (although he listed 8b on 8a.nu to not hurt anyone's feelings) and subsequent ascensionists have graded the route anywhere from hard 13c to hard 13d. In 2016/2017 a non-crucial undercling broke between the first and second crux. Contrary to unpopular belief, this break did not change the grade whatsoever.  Go get it!","{107736309: 4, 108027731: 4}"

If you are more experienced, you can easily downclimb a couple moves and grab your draws from below you when the bolt spacing is close together so as to have enough draws to protect the whole thing.","{107677137: 4, 109920420: 4, 110288180: 4, 107379236: 4, 107753556: 4, 108311708: 4, 107051650: 4, 112225865: 4, 110528367: 4, 109354696: 4, 109683196: 4, 109880920: 4, 112167460: 4, 107949979: 4, 109967593: 4, 112493702: 4, 111860789: 4, 106751248: 4, 200123813: 4, 112172298: 4, 200138171: 4, 200164254: 4, 112259711: 4, 106776607: 4, 111945227: 4, 105833953: 4, 200167995: 4, 111553438: 4, 200310794: 4, 200295749: 4, 200213084: 4, 200360284: 4, 108041064: 4, 111901677: 4, 106242342: 4, 200389003: 4, 106121156: 4, 200535636: 4, 200392328: 4, 107178510: 4, 200544978: 4, 200163959: 4, 200207295: 4, 200627675: 4, 200351610: 4, 200489763: 4, 200475012: 4, 200455650: 4, 200572814: 4, 200747144: 4, 200056966: 4, 109124792: 4, 200101945: 4, 200188352: 4, 106506554: 3, 107861772: 3, 105886712: 3, 108255376: 3, 109187861: 3, 107772111: 3, 107958782: 3, 110422165: 3, 108479906: 3, 106224129: 3, 110681824: 3, 111062291: 3, 110878497: 3, 107633146: 3, 109383300: 3, 111229682: 3, 109269951: 3, 110262051: 3, 109569494: 3, 111810697: 3, 111736166: 3, 108189980: 3, 111707793: 3, 109932423: 3, 111820839: 3, 107560585: 3, 107521255: 3, 111267362: 3, 110671467: 3, 111952086: 3, 111661495: 3, 111871501: 3, 111442903: 3, 109765597: 3, 112469324: 3, 108362846: 3, 110323884: 3, 111565043: 3, 111239574: 3, 112890078: 3, 200065675: 3, 112255826: 3, 111008821: 3, 200072147: 3, 110282876: 3, 107734417: 3, 111639255: 3, 110770284: 3, 113513570: 3, 112530701: 3, 112396583: 3, 112467439: 3, 200149618: 3, 200152447: 3, 108590756: 3, 200185382: 3, 200096545: 3, 109712255: 3, 106662993: 3, 113164188: 3, 112383380: 3, 108009228: 3, 112285440: 3, 106558490: 3, 112318234: 3, 110956309: 3, 111967377: 3, 111907313: 3, 200245103: 3, 112561537: 3, 200210379: 3, 111347316: 3, 200187954: 3, 106809240: 3, 112070348: 3, 200287728: 3, 200093542: 3, 200188264: 3, 111859893: 3, 200412708: 3, 200383645: 3, 200328547: 3, 112006439: 3, 200435408: 3, 110306301: 3, 108679988: 3, 200519364: 3, 200526167: 3, 200062258: 3, 200565348: 3, 200392723: 3, 107830036: 3, 110066899: 3, 200500246: 3, 106192059: 3, 200213045: 3, 200648459: 3, 200605581: 3, 200741505: 3, 200626811: 3, 200533093: 3, 200168413: 3, 200432336: 3, 200443370: 3, 106952502: 3, 200463523: 3, 200790717: 3, 107799943: 2, 108416778: 2, 108121087: 2, 108982544: 2, 107377680: 2, 106389733: 2, 110645520: 2, 110985261: 2, 111150841: 2, 110837448: 2, 112171525: 2, 111522290: 2, 106421544: 2, 111902978: 2, 107744773: 2, 109419310: 2, 111714935: 2, 200032183: 2, 108630916: 2, 110003738: 2, 105904878: 2, 110764470: 2, 107729812: 2, 108964383: 2, 200279829: 2, 111823584: 2, 109871099: 2, 200928734: 2, 200086061: 2, 107533935: 2}"

Start with a steep, bouldery move to two sandy, chossy holds. Grovel through this to the second bolt.  Whew, the worst of it is over.  Now climb interesting jugs to a stance at the base of the large roof. Follow jugs up and left [Snatch (13b) goes out the right line of bolts], using scary looking but apparently solid holds.  There's one smaller hold here, a jug-let, but overall this section isn't too bad and is very fun.  The end of the route climbs 10 feet up the headwall on flake jugs to annoying single-ring anchors.    I left the grade at 12a per the guidebook but in reality it's quite soft, probably around 11c or d.  You can rest pretty much anywhere and the holds when it gets steep are very good.  Worth doing if you like a little adventure.","{107289013: 3, 107867843: 3, 105956385: 2}"

Thanks to Rick Bost and John Nowell for allowing me to stand on their shoulders!   The Obed bolting moratorium is still in effect; no other new routes are allowed at this time.

Climb the steep face to a crux move and then fire out the insanely steep roof to the anchors.  Bolts 1 2 and 4 do not have fixed draws.  This is is a pumpy climb with an absolutely amazing roof.

Amazing position. Pitch 2: Continue up the crack to a small roof. Pull this roof on the right and keep climbing up the wide crack until you reach the crazy flake slot. Negotiate this feature and continue up crack to another optional ledge. Pitch 3: continue up the corner to a fixed knife blade right before it starts overhanging. This pin can be backed up.

When you get in the neighborhood of the tree, start angling left and up. There's a pine tree underneath the arete that marks the left end of the upper headwall. That's generally where you're headed.

Once things ease off, continue up and slightly left toward the pine tree mentioned in the ""easy way"" description above. (50 feet, 5.10)    P2-the main event: Start off a big block/ledge, maybe 20 feet right of the pine tree. Monkey your way up and slightly right through a series of overhangs. Surmounting the last overhang deposits you on a flat, vertical white face sprinkled with lichen. A hand crack almost immediately closes down to a finger crack that drifts in and out of existence as it works its way up the face. Fight the urge to chicken out to the Northwest Conversion crack 15 feet to your right. 25 feet of technical and sustained climbing leads you up the face.

Save some pro and energy reserves for the steeper sections toward the top.","{106558490: 4, 107086578: 4, 105805825: 4, 106108233: 4, 107062221: 4, 107361547: 4, 105886712: 4, 12194: 4, 13937: 4, 105897504: 4, 105886096: 4, 105802830: 4, 105904878: 4, 105907433: 4, 107342926: 4, 10232: 4, 105905885: 4, 106090597: 4, 107824972: 4, 106098470: 4, 107453284: 4, 105995488: 4, 105846730: 4, 106596992: 4, 105805486: 4, 107802445: 4, 106762498: 4, 106102927: 4, 107749195: 4, 106238436: 4, 107432607: 4, 107538421: 4, 105933662: 4, 106368697: 4, 12084: 4, 106196657: 4, 105854232: 4, 106272278: 4, 106006184: 4, 106068243: 4, 106125724: 4, 106449553: 4, 105811146: 4, 106304860: 4, 106314584: 4, 106281053: 4, 106415391: 4, 106777584: 4, 106775838: 4, 106832840: 4, 105886121: 4, 106967373: 4, 105860008: 4, 106065017: 4, 106470594: 4, 107068235: 4, 106919775: 4, 106607660: 4, 106794436: 4, 107465641: 4, 107270152: 4, 106682537: 4, 107861772: 4, 107473231: 4, 106290147: 4, 108043513: 4, 106098789: 4, 106410370: 4, 106901183: 4, 108277411: 4, 108327726: 4, 107631686: 4, 107635248: 4, 107887598: 4, 107694384: 4, 105994000: 4, 108443118: 4, 107658264: 4, 108139500: 4, 106146571: 4, 108861823: 4, 106389733: 4, 108105844: 4, 105841142: 4, 109133190: 4, 108417349: 4, 106911109: 4, 108119334: 4, 107481504: 4, 105833953: 4, 109406451: 4, 13965: 4, 106472037: 4, 108121087: 4, 109548191: 4, 109040008: 4, 106032918: 4, 109038770: 4, 106394111: 4, 105789175: 4, 106952502: 4, 14442: 4, 109383300: 4, 107327535: 4, 110198640: 4, 106506554: 4, 108320578: 4, 106941307: 4, 110116648: 4, 108679988: 4, 109585706: 4, 107324126: 4, 111062291: 4, 110045367: 4, 108857178: 4, 108110589: 4, 108270652: 4, 111660364: 4, 109759746: 4, 110411235: 4, 108117290: 4, 107729640: 4, 111747281: 4, 111785782: 4, 111267362: 4, 108735310: 4, 106751248: 4, 110818266: 4, 111795422: 4, 111740192: 4, 110246253: 4, 106981430: 4, 110685425: 4, 107837131: 4, 110315255: 4, 107379236: 4, 106421544: 4, 106999733: 4, 112253654: 4, 200160322: 4, 110878497: 4, 200122090: 4, 107232016: 4, 110331339: 4, 110262051: 4, 109747472: 4, 107067874: 4, 108193458: 4, 109894471: 4, 107183979: 4, 110739544: 4, 200151509: 4, 200032654: 4, 108992625: 4, 112285586: 4, 111030282: 4, 107142289: 4, 110956309: 4, 110224726: 4, 111871900: 4, 107929356: 4, 200067404: 4, 108220692: 4, 200213084: 4, 106210225: 4, 200094615: 4, 112449870: 4, 200334818: 4, 111639255: 4, 111820839: 4, 112042073: 4, 111160230: 4, 108033588: 4, 108686410: 4, 107130713: 4, 108243919: 4, 200435053: 4, 200043076: 4, 111783062: 4, 112373727: 4, 108274206: 4, 108311708: 4, 200130009: 4, 107521255: 4, 200194507: 4, 200084381: 4, 109409153: 4, 108027731: 4, 109679606: 4, 200172628: 4, 111697802: 4, 106192059: 4, 200393914: 4, 112207022: 4, 105898385: 4, 110965479: 4, 107563513: 4, 200482107: 4, 200146650: 4, 200230473: 4, 200335317: 4, 108279952: 4, 111466290: 4, 109596968: 4, 200261297: 4, 200309935: 4, 107755397: 4, 200465776: 4, 107472859: 3, 105979386: 3, 106071787: 3, 105961696: 3, 106689180: 3, 107995685: 3, 106255690: 3, 106009623: 3, 106550926: 3, 106372148: 3, 106413021: 3, 106298371: 3, 106744745: 3, 106358364: 3, 10610: 3, 106145409: 3, 106748559: 3, 106441684: 3, 108008921: 3, 106807906: 3, 106889934: 3, 107384266: 3, 106816785: 3, 107584835: 3, 107686628: 3, 106851399: 3, 107136345: 3, 108330151: 3, 107898897: 3, 107989551: 3, 108023226: 3, 107528242: 3, 107850559: 3, 108553123: 3, 108720484: 3, 105996074: 3, 106308715: 3, 107051650: 3, 107224111: 3, 106405973: 3, 108608330: 3, 108853339: 3, 106325770: 3, 106562865: 3, 107417501: 3, 106662918: 3, 107328579: 3, 106954371: 3, 107843504: 3, 109043313: 3, 14213: 3, 107795619: 3, 107696530: 3, 107060248: 3, 110985261: 3, 110859480: 3, 109423069: 3, 108424569: 3, 105967115: 3, 109488917: 3, 107734417: 3, 108718600: 3, 111871501: 3, 112296835: 3, 107636562: 3, 111806823: 3, 111161113: 3, 109880920: 3, 108451934: 3, 108800901: 3, 111426811: 3, 110152422: 3, 108541430: 3, 107531373: 3, 200009978: 3, 112468813: 3, 111969139: 3, 110807699: 3, 200063239: 3, 112359946: 3, 200300042: 3, 200145838: 3, 112091216: 3, 107469778: 3, 111163750: 3, 110998676: 3, 200038676: 3, 106951875: 3, 200248595: 3, 107743173: 3, 106484179: 3, 107768941: 3, 12023: 3, 105807267: 3, 112171525: 3, 107134757: 3, 12258: 2, 105947552: 2, 105798365: 2, 105899248: 2, 106268527: 2, 106238291: 2, 106568500: 2, 109932423: 2, 111415956: 2, 109877052: 2, 108647959: 2, 109513381: 2, 111991578: 2, 107254662: 2, 110205951: 2, 112024720: 2, 111004367: 2, 107744773: 1}"
Grand Contusion,116576041,Trad,105852010,5.13b,100,1,4.0,1.0,"A sort of complicated history for this route. Originally ascended by Rob Robinson starting in the corner 20 ft left of the Squatter's Rites ramp. Climb up this corner which protects well enough with small gear. Traverse right as you near the roof, until reaching a good rest at the base of a crack like feature running directly out the roof. Probably 10+ to here. Place some gear from this good stance, and then climb a long boulder problem until reaching the lip. A few moves into this sequence you can place some gear, but by the end you will be well beyond your last piece. At the lip, make a strenuous placement (or don't) and mantle onto the ledge. A great rest and easy 5.10 climbing take you to a bolted anchor directly above.   This route has a bit of controversy about whether Robinson's ascent was done with fixed gear in the roof. The route was bolted entirely at some point, with a direct start (mid 5.11) on the face rather than the corner. The bolts continue alongside what Robinson originally climbed on gear. Supposedly, the two lines are meant to be different, because the original line goes all the way left into the mantle at the lip, whereas the bolted line goes up a few moves early. Same grade either way. Regardless, you have the option to clip bolts or gear, and climb an unquestionably badass line!  ",{108952271: 4}

I do not know in fact how hard the line will be in all. I rated it only for its moves, not sustenance.    It has just been affirmed by some locals (Chris Watford & John Liles) that this was a probable F.A. and likely still unrepeated.     The following was a description I wrote in 1995 and just recently found again with Google:    ""I got up Sunday morning just before sunrise and cooked some oatmeal before heading up the hill. I was up there by 8am, and climbing. I hooked up with Joe, a guy who was also alone that day, at least until his pal showed up in the afternoon. Joe is a guide and instructor for a local climbing school, and knows Twall pretty well. Joe asked what routes I did the day previous to figure out what I climbed like, so he could choose some good lines for us to do. I mentioned doing ""A nastily runout 5.10+ that seemed to be more like a 5.11 to me""  Joe said ""Was it called MEAN CUISINE?"" Apparently the route has a reputation...    Joe and I warmed up on the moderate, yet sustained ""PASSAGES (5.8)"". It is a **** lovely route, about 130' tall, a must-do. Joe cruised up behind and we rapped off.  I spent some time doing some boudering and snagging a few routes before Joe and I decided to do a 5.10a dihedral called ""Margin Of Profit"" that I'd heard about.  I and Joe located it and I quickly jammed up past the first roof, then up to the second roof about 80' or 90' off of the deck.  Several people had said something about heading left out of the dihedral, and there was a big horizontal. I placed a few pieces under the roof and looked both left and right. I was getting pumped, so I hastily went left, as I thought I had been advised. Well, as I heel-hooked up and around the arete on which I had arrived I pulled myself to a spread-legged sitting position on the 8 inch ledge/corner and yelled ""I must be in the front Row!"" A few people looked up and said that I was off route, and that I should have gone right.  Standing on the ledge and looking over, I realized that they were right. There the big holds were! I was too pumped to get back down the roof, so I paced a blind nut or two and started strait up. One person yelled ""Hey, it's a new route."" I responded (20' above my last piece, feeling pumped and on 5.10 moves) ""I'll call it 'Margin of Error' if I live.    After about another 10' I got a good piece, and ran another 20' to the top. It was an awesome route, about 130-140' or more in total height. Joe trailed his rope and started up. About 10 falls later he started talking about it being a bit difficult. At the top (20 falls later?) he looked at me with saucer sized eyes and said ""That was a stout lead."" I looked at him and responded: ""Thaths whffath I Wath Sthfinking!""  My mouth was still a little to dry to talk correctly...    John Cioci (my usual climbing partner) had arrived to see the latter half of the adventure, and pulled and coiled the ropes while I booted and packed up. We hiked out and started the drive back, my head still abuzz. It would have been my last route of the day whether or not John showed up.

Wrestling over this cave with dignity intact will be the crux for most; after this, a long, exposed crack leads to the right side of the big roof above.","{106394111: 4, 106098470: 4, 106919775: 4, 110041899: 4, 107270152: 4, 105801073: 4, 106961703: 4, 107887598: 4, 108023226: 4, 111426811: 4, 108720484: 4, 108297579: 4, 107636562: 4, 105833953: 4, 108139500: 4, 110818266: 4, 105789175: 4, 107400819: 4, 105934965: 4, 108686410: 4, 107465641: 4, 200171784: 4, 106089041: 4, 105990845: 4, 200299214: 4, 200146650: 4, 107755397: 4, 11387: 4, 107062221: 4, 109894471: 4, 200130009: 4, 106415391: 4, 200084381: 4, 106009623: 4, 106777584: 4, 106489329: 4, 105967115: 3, 200345613: 3, 109488917: 3, 105907433: 3, 106210225: 3, 110152422: 3, 109409153: 3, 111795422: 3, 110331339: 3, 106981430: 3, 106999733: 3, 111267362: 3, 105805825: 3, 106851399: 3, 106682537: 3, 106794436: 3, 107052446: 3, 106449553: 3, 106314584: 3, 105904878: 3, 107342926: 3, 105845475: 3, 105802830: 3, 107101828: 3, 109383300: 3, 106238291: 3, 106032918: 3, 109043313: 3, 108104464: 3, 107481504: 3, 108853339: 3, 108320578: 3, 106558490: 3, 12258: 3, 108155370: 3, 107086578: 2, 110116648: 2, 106662918: 2, 108718600: 2, 106901183: 2, 108043513: 2}"

If you go to the top, head towards the orange streak on the high left hand face. Hug the right side of the streak to a tree anchor. Pretty fun for those of you looking for something slightly off the beaten path!    This route doesn't seem to get much action, and you will probably have decking potential because gear is sparse. Tread carefully!    On the plus side, it is pretty fun face climbing and you are almost guaranteed not to wait in line!",{106794436: 2}
Over the Rainbow,118346940,Sport,105852010,5.13-,70,1,3.0,1.0,"Make good clipping choices and climb out the dirty but solid roof to the lip. Pull a hardish move here (12cish?) and continue up about 30' of juggy terrain. When the holds disappear, put on your thinking cap and figure out how to pry the elevator doors open. Reach the only downpulling hold next to the final bolt, and make a long decisive move into the opposite seam. Pull on good holds to the anchor. One of the more decisively technical face climbs in all of T  Wall.   On a day when the waterfall is running well, the route often stays dry and it's likely that looking over at the waterfall from the anchor, you might see a rainbow arching from your height on the wall all the way to the ground.   Good single rope beta for the beginning of the route: If you clip the opening draws in the roof as they're installed, you will end up with unclimbable rope drag as you enter the crux of the climb, and take some heinous falls. The beta that worked well was using a 20' stick clip to hang a 24"" sling on the furthest bolt out in the roof (it has a cleaning carabiner on it). Back clip the climber from that sling into the bolt behind it with another 24"" sling (technically the 3rd bolt on the climb). This allows the climber to effectively toprope or follow to the the closest sling, unclip it, and climb past the second sling without unclipping to the third draw, which protects the hard lip move. The first two bolts on the route are corroded choss and too deep in the cave to protect your fall any way. This rope management allows you to cleanly climb with out any on-route shenanigans, and makes the crux falls far softer.",{106744745: 3}

Razor Worm,105888820,Trad,105852010,5.8+,100,1,3.1,241.0,"Rated three stars in the DCA, this is an excellent moderate with a great panoramic view of the valley.    There are two basic variations to start Razor Worm.  The easy way is starting at a huge flake, work up the right side of the flake, then follow a crack system up the face.  A more exciting alternative is left of the big flake (and a tree); boulder up on good holds and continue up through a chimney section and on to the crack system.  A bulge toward the top is the crux; use either of two vertical cracks about three feet apart, or barrel-hug both.  After surmounting the bulge, continue up on easier ground to anchors at the top of the cliff.","{105886712: 4, 105898716: 4, 105802830: 4, 106089041: 4, 105845475: 4, 105899248: 4, 106068243: 4, 106272885: 4, 105933662: 4, 105854232: 4, 106304860: 4, 106777584: 4, 106744745: 4, 105886121: 4, 106741672: 4, 106689180: 4, 107995660: 4, 108034717: 4, 106901183: 4, 108277411: 4, 107631686: 4, 106961703: 4, 105994000: 4, 107528242: 4, 106146571: 4, 106389733: 4, 105996074: 4, 109234619: 4, 109038770: 4, 106955014: 4, 109383300: 4, 106941307: 4, 108679988: 4, 111062291: 4, 111747281: 4, 111785782: 4, 112454958: 4, 200009978: 4, 112285586: 4, 200096545: 4, 111871900: 4, 109353144: 4, 200334818: 4, 112351657: 4, 106751248: 4, 108243919: 4, 200435053: 4, 108311708: 4, 105841142: 4, 200194507: 4, 200070883: 4, 108027731: 4, 107327535: 4, 200130009: 4, 107563513: 4, 106952502: 4, 200499702: 4, 108279952: 4, 200465784: 4, 111639255: 4, 107062221: 3, 12194: 3, 13937: 3, 105897504: 3, 105886096: 3, 107342926: 3, 10232: 3, 106098470: 3, 105905885: 3, 106056907: 3, 106736701: 3, 106558490: 3, 107802445: 3, 106506554: 3, 107995685: 3, 107538421: 3, 12084: 3, 106296762: 3, 106125724: 3, 106449553: 3, 106368697: 3, 106314584: 3, 106670468: 3, 106775838: 3, 106358364: 3, 106372148: 3, 105860008: 3, 107052446: 3, 105798365: 3, 106147458: 3, 108008921: 3, 106919775: 3, 106607660: 3, 106794436: 3, 107465641: 3, 107270152: 3, 107473231: 3, 107861772: 3, 107361547: 3, 106098789: 3, 106851399: 3, 107694384: 3, 107618826: 3, 108043513: 3, 107658264: 3, 106238291: 3, 106967373: 3, 107067874: 3, 107989551: 3, 108023226: 3, 107224111: 3, 106405973: 3, 108608330: 3, 108853339: 3, 106325770: 3, 107481504: 3, 105833953: 3, 13965: 3, 106472037: 3, 106329264: 3, 108155370: 3, 109416636: 3, 106032918: 3, 107795619: 3, 106394111: 3, 107843504: 3, 105789175: 3, 14442: 3, 109043313: 3, 107400819: 3, 109269951: 3, 108320578: 3, 107958782: 3, 109932423: 3, 110116648: 3, 107060248: 3, 108857178: 3, 108110589: 3, 107755397: 3, 109423069: 3, 109759746: 3, 110411235: 3, 110985261: 3, 111521329: 3, 111347316: 3, 111267362: 3, 107734417: 3, 108718600: 3, 106909499: 3, 112287615: 3, 107254662: 3, 111795422: 3, 109092361: 3, 112440802: 3, 107749195: 3, 110246253: 3, 110685425: 3, 107837131: 3, 109880920: 3, 110315255: 3, 111426811: 3, 106999733: 3, 200081933: 3, 112253654: 3, 107232016: 3, 110262051: 3, 108330151: 3, 200088163: 3, 109894471: 3, 110152422: 3, 200151509: 3, 108992625: 3, 200032654: 3, 110956309: 3, 109488917: 3, 110807699: 3, 108220692: 3, 200122090: 3, 112163760: 3, 200145838: 3, 108088813: 3, 200213084: 3, 112091216: 3, 106210225: 3, 107469778: 3, 111163750: 3, 200335451: 3, 113170642: 3, 110762698: 3, 200038676: 3, 200248595: 3, 112373727: 3, 110337843: 3, 109409153: 3, 107361910: 3, 200443464: 3, 108274206: 3, 200146650: 3, 200299214: 3, 12023: 3, 111466290: 3, 200467580: 3, 200335317: 3, 110962064: 3, 200465776: 3, 12258: 2, 107086578: 2, 105904878: 2, 105979386: 2, 107887598: 2, 106238436: 2, 106255690: 2, 106415391: 2, 105907433: 2, 107296004: 2, 106470594: 2, 107384266: 2, 106268527: 2, 106682537: 2, 108147590: 2, 106410370: 2, 108139500: 2, 108720484: 2, 106662918: 2, 107328579: 2, 111431583: 2, 110045367: 2, 107521255: 2, 107729640: 2, 108647959: 2, 110818266: 2, 108170319: 2, 109747472: 2, 112468813: 2, 109080138: 2, 112359946: 2, 112042073: 2, 107529159: 2, 200393914: 2, 109596968: 2}"

The crux is pretty obvious, a very steep bulge that looks blank.  Use a cool, hidden fingerlock/jug and a slopey undercling to make a very large move up and left to a blind hold.  A knee bar can be useful here to check the swing.  Now head for the Dark Star, the big hole above, using huge holds in very steep rock.
