The two pitches can be combined, but then if Top-Roping in the normal way from the bottom, using a normal dynamic rope, if the climber falls near the bottom, then due to rope stretch the fall could be longer or harder and the climber could be injured.

P1: Start at base of left-trending inside corner facing left, which is below left from obvious down-protruding nose about 25 ft up. Up the inside corner to just right of the obvious down-protruding nose. Up into the gully, then up its left side (with hands using right side of nose rock).

Jungle Gym,115789525.0,Trad,106412830.0,5.5,220.0,2.0,1.5,2.0," Pitch 1: Start at the spot found in the picture section. Scramble up from there 20 ft. Continue up as the path described by the yellow rope found in the picture titled “Entire Pitch 1.” In a similar picture, you'll find a yellow circle, red circle, and purple arrow marking. The yellow circle marks the place where this pitch ends, a blueberry evergreen type tree. Go next to a very healthy small evergreen blueberry tree, just on its right where there is a nice ledge. This belay spot will protect you from falling rock if the leader releases blocks on the 2nd pitch. The red circle marks the crux of the pitch, where there is a small but difficult roof. The roof move is about a 5.8 DWG move…prepare to do pull ups. If the roof appears too cruxy for you, there is an escape to the left where the purple arrow is pointing to, that will allow you to skirt left and then back on top of the crux. However, beware as you come to that arete where the purple arrow is, there is some loose rock…don’t grab just anything. The picture with the yellow rope shows the line curving hard right (see the zoom picture) from the crux to get to the right of the small evergreen for a belay point, but feel free to head straight up from the crux. I thought the rock just below and left of the small evergreen looked sketchy and chose to move hard right, ending up on the right of the small evergreen. Again, this is a safer belay spot to protect you from rockfall anyway. Picture of the first belay found in the picture section. You can choose to belay just prior to the evergreen tree (just beneath) if you have #3 and #4 BD Camalots on you then. 110ft  Pitch 2: Exit left and up from the evergreen tree to some easy slab (10ft) and immediately into a large corner on your right (with a roof above to the slight left). Above you, you'll see many small trees, larger trees, and eventually a large thorn hanging bush (growing down). Don’t attempt to go on top of the formation that was above you at the belay. Instead stay in the corner, occasionally leaving the corner to the left a little to avoid loose blocks, branches, and small trees. Extend carefully to avoid rope drag. There are some very loose 50lb blocks on this route. Aim to get just to the left of the massive hanging thorn bush. Stand on top of the thorn bush (the stalks are lying flat to reach out to the sun and down). Then climb the easy 20ft chimney with stemming. Face outwards as you do this chimney. Near the top of the chimney you'll find good edges on your right (your right as you face out of the chimney) side to transition out and around onto the arete, which is 5ft out of your reach. It may seem overhanging to make this reach, but there is a nice spot for your foot on that arete once you commit out to the arete and good small fingers. One clawing onto the arete, climb about 5ft and you are at the top. 20ft back on the top there are nice slots for cams. See pic titled “2nd belay” in the pictures section. Make sure to extend from your set up back to the top edge of your climb, so that you can communicate with your follower. In this way, you'll be able to encourage struggling followers as they move from chimney to arete. 100ft  Like 75% of the lcimbs in the DWG, make sure to bring working cell phones or two-way radios.

Colorado,115789452.0,Trad,106411615.0,5.6,200.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,"This route has alot of bad rock on it.  Not for a novice!  This is particularly true on the middle of the route where the often black rock is hollow sounding and will not hold a real fall.  Consider it very dangerous overall.  Work hard to find solid rock placements, which are sometimes few and far between.  Pitch 1 (5.6+): Climb the corner that is just before the tree (in picture by Joe Heinz) at the base, passing the ceiling on it's right. Your initial goal is to stand on top of that ceiling. Turning to pass the ceiling is a crux move.....look for a hand jam in this move to help you (see Joe Heinz's pic with yellow circle highlight).  At crux, there is a large loose rock on your right...be careful not to grab.  The crux move might be much higher than 5.6.  My partner and I felt it was more towards a 5.8 at the DWG. After passing the roof, climb up to the easy access ledge, which has many thorns, and belay (see pic). 40ft  LINK Pitch 2 and 3 together: Pass the small roof that is just above the belay station by directly going up through the roof or by stepping 5ft to the right and accessing the easier arete and face.  This small roof is 10-15ft above the belay station. Climb up to the corner directly above 2nd roof and follow it until huge overhangs force you hard left and out to the obvious arete to your left that turns 90 degrees and places you on a new face. This is easy climbing in this section (5.4).  The rock in this corner and as you escape the roof at the very top of the climb (according to the old description pitch 2) is often bad, and no good belay can now be created at the 90 deg turn from the one face to the other.   Once you make this 90deg turn, you'll be out from underneath the large roof that was above you (for the old description of pitch 2) and find a new corner to climb with no roof above you. From above 2nd small roof to 90 deg turn is 85ft. Continue up now in the new obvious corner.  Pass the 2 trees very near the top (found in my other pic) because they have become suspect raps to the more solid rock at the top out to make an anchor.  It would be better to top out and walk your way back over to the triumvirate face and rap down off of THE RIB route. The 2nd corner section is about 80ft long.  To make the above run, since the rock is pretty questionable along the 2nd and 3rd pitch with no clear anchor point, you need to link together pitch 2 and 3.  To accomplish that, every piece needs an extended alpine runner.  I suggest a 70m rope.  (2nd and 3rd pitch together could be from 180ft to 200ft depending on your angle you take to escape the huge roof on the 2nd pitch)  I may have missed the belay station the 90deg turn mentioned above...but I searched hard for it and could not find it.  It may have collapsed out.  All I found was alot of nominal placements in nominal rock....alot of hollow sounding, black rock.  If you can find it, please take a pic and rewrite the above description.  I would love to have that 2nd belay station and not create a link up of 2 pitches.","{108832944: 3, 106359752: 2}"

Tammany Girdle (Incomplete),110328958.0,Trad,106411588.0,5.8+,1400.0,11.0,3.0,1.0,"When climbing at the Delaware Water Gap is mentioned, most people describe the style of climbing as ""Adventure Climbing"" due to the moss covered and vegetated nature of the rock, and the limited climbing traffic the majority of the cliff receives.  With that being said, if you are looking for some long adventure climbing, the Tammany Girdle will absolutely fit the bill.    I'll point out here we did our best to follow the guidebook description, which is laughably vague for such a long route, so if we did not follow the ""true"" girdle route line, it was because we honestly had no idea where we were going.    Per the Falcon Guide ""Rock Climbing New Jersey"" ""Tammany Girdle (5.7) Traverse the middle of the cliff from I-80 to Easy Lieback in many pitches.  At the Colorado route, temporarily descend enough to bypass the bleak, dark wall.""    So I'll try to further clarify the above description with our chosen route:   Pitch 1: Start on Dead Man's Curve and climb the entire pitch.  At the fixed anchor, continue climbing right under a low roof until a V notch is reached.  Climb to the top of the notch and belay at a stance.  5.8+ 150ft.   Pitch 2: Climb right from the belay and follow the grassy ledges which angle up and right at approximately 1/3 cliff height.  Belay on a grassy ledge with a fixed sling after approximately 150ft. 5.1   Pitch 3: Climb right on easy ~5.6 terrain up a slabby ramp and continue climbing right.  Near the end of the pitch, climb across a chimney and belay at a stance with some old fixed slings.  5.7 150 ft   Pitch 4: Climb right off the belay to the inside corner, and down climb the corner approximately 6 feet, then move right and around the outside corner and continue climbing right and slightly up.  Belay at the outside corner near the Class Four Ramp Area.  5.8 PG 13 150ft.   Pitch 5: Climb right across the Class Four Ramp to the steeper wall with diagonaling cracks, utilizing the cracks pull around onto the slabby ramp and continue up and right to the belay at the end of Black Wall pitch 1.  5.8 100ft.   Pitch 6: Climb the inside corner pitch of Black Wall, and continue right past the tree below the ceiling and across the easy face ending at the top of Triumvirate.  5.7 100ft.   Pitch 7: Traverse right off the belay and follow the wide crack to The Rib, follow the corner to the top of the wall and the P2 bolts.  5.3 50ft.   Rappel The Rib until you reach the slabby ramp below Friends in High Places at about 50ft off the ground.   Pitch 8: We fought thru some trees under ""spanning the gap"", and then started diagonaling up the wall, eventually joining the first pitch of Double Overhang, ending on a steeply angled ledge at the outside corner about 15 feet above the Mid-wall juniper on Double Overhang. (Very awkward belay, but the best spot for the traverse - 15 feet left of and 6 feet above the Corkscrew Belay)    Pitch 9: From the P8 belay, it is only about 15 feet to the Corkscrew first station belay. Passing the corkscrew belay and continuing around the arete, we continued across, passing Martin's Fall with very thin gear (Brassies / Ballnuts), and continuing just past Tree Toad Fracture on the slabs (RT#67 in the Falcon Guide). This section is dangerous for the second. The last 20 feet to the inside corner tenuous and unprotected at about 5.8 if you find the holds.    Pitch 10: From P9 it was easy traversing up slabs with occasional fights with trees. Belayed on the slabs about 120 feet at a spot about 20' below a large tree with slings and rings.     The angle after of the cliff is dramatically reduced, I think the remaining traversing pitches would be relatively easy.
