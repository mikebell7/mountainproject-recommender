Bunkbed,116648818,Boulder,112785974,V2,0,1,2.0,1.0,"This wall is short so we had to get creative with our traverses. The very top of the rock is OFF ROUTE. Stand start on the obvious ledge left of the cave. Find a crimp above the ledge for the left and a decent ledge out to the right. This will allow you to lower your leg to an obvious ledge. From here match your left to your right and then go for the pinch deeper in the cave. From here use the obvious holds to reach the two flat protustions that look like bunk beds. Match the top bunk and then top out the boulder.   During the first ascent I somehow ending sitting criss-cross applesauce on on the “bottom bunk” before matching the final hold and topping out. I didn’t do that for fun, that was my legit beta.",{112161285: 2}

Throw around the corner to a crimp and then establish your feet on a good ledge. Stand up on the ledge without using the top and you’re done.,{112161285: 3}
