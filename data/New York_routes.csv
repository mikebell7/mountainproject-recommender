Be aware, there are zebra muscles close to the water line (or right on it depending on the lake water levels): it it highly recommended that you use a paddle board or something you can stand on in order to mount the wall, especially if water levels are low. We only had time to explore this one route (5 people climbing to roughly 30ft), but there are endless other route opportunities to be found. Beware of submerged rocks in other places though!",{200892192: 3}

Perhaps the “Flex’s-flyer” flake on P2 has broken off???Here’s how I remember it from about 10-12 yrs ago.Please note P3 seems to be different from that described in Adk Rock. We may have done a variation, or it may be just difference in wording, or my memory may have forgotten a part of the pitch, but it (P3) seemed scary to me even following it!P1 - As described in “Location”, it’s probably best to find the bush at the left end of the overlap ( get back from the base) to get oriented, and then climb the discontinuous cracks, flakes and ledges to it. 100-120 ft. 5.8 R-ish, mostly because of poor quality flakes.P2 - Easily move right along the overlap for 15-20 ft until below a bolt ( hand drilled on this ascent by Mark) and a small horizontal flake above it. ( Is this flake still there?) Climb up and over the “flex-flyer” flake (pulling down, not out!) and then move up on run-out terrain , moving right to a belay. AdkRock speaks of a fixed belay shared with Inner Space, I don't recall that, but I know we rapped the line back to our packs at the  base, so it must be there. A short pitch, 50-60 ft  AdkRock gives it 5.9+/ 5.8R Whatever the difficulty, even with the bolt the move(s) at the bolt are probably R-ish due to the ledge below, but WITH the bolt you’ll probably only sprain an ankle or two, vs spraining/breaking, then pitching off backwards down the slab head-first!P3 - Move left from the belay, then scary climbing up a shallow right-facing corner (piton?) then move up and left over thin slab eventually gaining the base of the “visor”, a.k.a. The Arch. Move up and right to a gear belay.  Another short pitch, about 60-80 ft, 5.8+R, scary, even to follow.

Belay here. There is no real crux except for the long runout. Rock is good, feet are there; but there is most definitely a long runout.     P2 (5.4PG) - 80': Go up the vertical crack then break right, going up to and past the left facing corner. Belay just past the corner. Anchor beta: I belayed to the right and top of the corner. There is a vertical crack there that feels much safer than the small horizontals a bit higher.    P3 (5.5PG) - 120': Straight up and over the corner above the belay, to another left facing corner. Traverse right to the tree ledge. The crux of this pitch was getting over the corner right off the belay.     P4 (5.5PG) - 190': This is a great pitch, and wanders somewhat: From the belay, 4th class for a about 40' right, then go up straight through the middle of the overlap, then to a second overlap. Undercling left, and at the corner, go up. Move up the face next to the left arching overlaps and break through before they end. There is a piton (doesn't look too old) towards the beginning of the arches. Once over the arches, friction up to the trees.  Walk off by continuing up to the top through the bushes then following the trail back down to the campground. At hospital rock (big rock at a lookout), take a right. The walkout takes about 30 minutes. It's not worth abseiling IMHO.    If you do decide to rap anyway, remember that the rappels deposit you at the base of the visor section of the slab, which means that you'll need to get back up to the vegetated ledge to get your stuff (if you leave some there).

The gear on the 5.10 sections of this climb is small and decently spaced. I would not hesitate to call it PG 13. The 5.7 jug haul is unprotected for the last 15-20 feet and certainly R. The holds are, however, the definition of juggy.        There is a direct version that pulls a roof to the right of the mainline. It goes at 5.10d R, but can be easily TR'd off of the same anchors.","{106412174: 4, 106670299: 4, 107609575: 4, 106215535: 4, 105798365: 4, 105870586: 4, 106418097: 4, 106985791: 4, 107281563: 4, 107093945: 4, 107217526: 4, 106394111: 4, 106897206: 4, 105891309: 4, 108184923: 4, 107548455: 4, 106108233: 4, 106687445: 4, 108845522: 4, 107745631: 4, 106993942: 4, 106325770: 4, 108266837: 4, 108364313: 4, 108711756: 4, 107801617: 4, 106967283: 4, 108218304: 4, 110211008: 4, 108344951: 4, 107226876: 4, 108266600: 4, 108307042: 4, 12328: 4, 109467833: 4, 108155086: 4, 108843325: 4, 106647777: 4, 109629902: 4, 106863637: 4, 106486112: 4, 110510769: 4, 107929356: 4, 106981430: 4, 107932282: 4, 200061049: 4, 110337843: 4, 107412430: 4, 106423391: 4, 108348917: 4, 112086258: 4, 112042073: 4, 11409: 4, 110165451: 4, 111146152: 4, 107783937: 4, 107246852: 4, 110315255: 4, 112404909: 4, 109212068: 4, 111502816: 4, 107373153: 4, 112180232: 4, 200302765: 4, 200037506: 4, 109932626: 4, 107998399: 4, 109411206: 4, 200288455: 4, 112030305: 4, 106342472: 4, 108701917: 4, 111662106: 4, 109869056: 4, 106306400: 3, 106586290: 3, 107688970: 3, 109139789: 3, 107277139: 3, 109816235: 3, 111050040: 3, 107174265: 3, 112138806: 3, 108988764: 3, 112128138: 3, 111777299: 3, 108259746: 3, 109411750: 3, 111841723: 3, 106210225: 3, 111756523: 3, 110619029: 3, 108225547: 3, 112838794: 3, 109018466: 3, 110133075: 3, 106897359: 3, 106405973: 3, 111857489: 3, 105995341: 3, 200345231: 3, 200248105: 3, 200233886: 3, 106646308: 3, 200399381: 3, 200855703: 3, 200466949: 3, 109767025: 3, 200229308: 3, 106889934: 2, 108032974: 2, 105898385: 2, 112129540: 2}"

Might wanna put 2 at the lip before you attempt getting established on the face - it already feels pretty intimidating, after that easy solo up and that humongous headwall stretching 100+ feet up, perfectly flat & vertical (or does it not lean slightly over you?) covering all of your field of view.  Getting established might feel like the hardest part, but it won't let up much. Get ready for a fight. Once you're midway into the thing, take the time to appreciate the vast expense of vertical rock surrounding you. Then look up and realize you've still a long way to go....","{200051409: 4, 105798365: 3, 107246852: 3}"

Pitch 3 offers a mentally demanding and committing exposed line that will not disappoint. Pitch 1 can be avoided by linking the first pitch of Prelude with Pitches 2 and 3, thus maintaining the 5.8 grade.   Pitch 1 (5.10a):An unprotected boulder problem start leads to a short, shallow, and thin left-facing corner with a bolt at the end of the corner. At the top of the corner, exit working up and left to another bolt. From the second bolt, climb up on easier (5.8ish), albeit unprotected, terrain to a two-bolt anchor (shared with Prelude).   Pitch 2 (5.6): From the belay, work left to the large, low-angle, left-facing corner. Climb the corner to where it meets a short vertical step and work left to the obvious crack. An uncharacteristically hard move gains the low-angle rock above. Continue up, trending left, past another vertical step to a large ledge to build a gear anchor.   Pitch 3 (5.8): From the ledge, drop down to the climber's left (consider protecting the second here with a #00 TCU size micro-cam) and traverse over to a lone bolt on the low-angle face to the right of the arete. Make a committing move up on the arete until you can see a left-rising ramp appear. Make a highly exposed, highly committing move around the arete and onto the ramp (good protection) to gain the small corner formed by the ramp. Climb the ramp to gain a second, much welcomed, bolt. Move left from the bolt, into the prominent corner. Continue to the top, on easier terrain to build a gear anchor.   Note: On pitch 1, it is possible to escape climber's right into the first pitch of Prelude at the second bolt and above the second bolt after a short unprotected section (the latter being a good way to tame the stretch between protection after the second bolt).","{107572777: 4, 112329309: 4, 110315426: 4, 110165451: 4, 109869056: 4, 109472534: 4, 111662106: 4, 110337843: 4, 112150512: 4, 108541868: 4, 200145352: 4, 111502816: 4, 109227875: 4, 107629487: 4, 107660333: 4, 110164339: 4, 106418097: 4, 106412174: 4, 106687445: 4, 107548455: 4, 107801617: 4, 107805686: 4, 111080878: 4, 108367150: 4, 109816235: 4, 108598790: 4, 108201220: 3, 112086258: 3, 200335317: 3, 105798365: 3, 112042073: 3, 106117267: 3, 106981430: 3, 111046154: 3, 110148121: 3}"

Get a great rest on phenomenally featured rock at about 3/4 of the way, and finish up by climbing the lower-angled hand and finger crack to the chain anchors.","{105898385: 4, 106217033: 4, 105804842: 4, 106549436: 4, 106108233: 4, 106743674: 4, 106687445: 4, 106985791: 4, 107216423: 4, 107660333: 4, 107417154: 4, 108507815: 4, 107994682: 4, 107742566: 4, 105798365: 4, 106993942: 4, 109107529: 4, 105891309: 4, 106897206: 4, 109364349: 4, 108311593: 4, 109411206: 4, 108394904: 4, 106214584: 4, 108118109: 4, 107620610: 4, 110185189: 4, 109611406: 4, 109964043: 4, 109856888: 4, 106863637: 4, 111371412: 4, 108097686: 4, 106981430: 4, 110751062: 4, 110315426: 4, 107629487: 4, 112086258: 4, 108390129: 4, 111087111: 4, 110165451: 4, 110821496: 4, 200041322: 4, 200067404: 4, 200318356: 4, 109629902: 4, 111969490: 4, 109018466: 4, 108028939: 4, 111756523: 4, 112042073: 4, 200372430: 4, 112131062: 4, 200248105: 4, 200233886: 4, 200059743: 4, 200078397: 4, 111289156: 4, 111203516: 4, 112180232: 4, 200101132: 4, 200335317: 4, 106342472: 4, 200426442: 4, 105899248: 4, 112042220: 4, 200466030: 4, 200350797: 4, 200267777: 4, 112377733: 4, 106889934: 3, 107548455: 3, 106405973: 3, 106426493: 3, 106637976: 3, 106117267: 3, 108032974: 3, 106282030: 3, 106418097: 3, 106150571: 3, 106412174: 3, 106306400: 3, 106963071: 3, 106933730: 3, 107238223: 3, 108266837: 3, 108367150: 3, 106567319: 3, 109597965: 3, 107450687: 3, 109767025: 3, 106529846: 3, 108085357: 3, 106822110: 3, 108348917: 3, 107878563: 3, 106210225: 3, 106038528: 3, 107226876: 3, 108541868: 3, 111841723: 3, 111046154: 3, 106095990: 3, 107412430: 3, 111921737: 3, 109411750: 3, 200144181: 3, 109869056: 3, 107931921: 3, 106879280: 3, 107469778: 3, 106554217: 3, 108310475: 3, 200135688: 3, 200299677: 3, 200066867: 3, 200150318: 3, 106394111: 2, 108162489: 2, 109495327: 2, 107536174: 2, 111460596: 2, 200396867: 2}"

On the final pitch you can choose to climb the thin crack out to the right at 5.10, but it doesn't get a lot of traffic so the lichen and dirt may be a bit impeding.

Creation of the World,105871064,Trad,105871061,5.10+,350,3,3.7,7.0,"Start: On the overhanging northeast face, find the lone low bolt and begin just to the right.  Pitch 1: Clip the bolt (while standing on the ground) and make difficult face moves leftwards past the bolt to a small overlap. Small TCUs and nuts protect the moves up the shallow left-facing corner and into the ""flare"". The flare constitutes the crux of the pitch and is easier for small people: awkward moves and good protection in the back of the flare (#2 Camalot, nuts) take one to a small cedar and an adequate belay. 5.11a  Pitch 2: Step down and left from the belay onto rounded, green footholds. Move directly left (red Alien) and into a left-facing corner with fixed nuts. Continue straight left, then step down once again and climb desperately left (5.11 R), finally reaching some good cracks. Climb straight up -- hands, then fists -- to a stance. From here the crack turns offwidth (#5 Camalot); hard offwidth climbing leads to better holds near the giant cedar. Continue up the offwidth crack (another #5 Camalot) until the crack widens and is filled with flakes and blocks. The crack widens into a chimney; climb deeper into the cliff behind the wedged blocks finally emerging onto a giant, flat block the size of dining room table and set a belay. This block is very spooky, as it is many tonnes, yet pivots on a center axis. 5.11a  Pitch 3: Stemming and chimney technique allows one to climb up and out from the belay to where the crack pinches down to offwidth size. A #5 Camalot protects the transition from stemming/chimneying to laybacking. Strenuous laybacking and offwidth climbing (another #5 Camalot) eventually gives way to a hand/fist crack, which is followed to a spacious belay ledge on the arête. 5.11b  Pitch 4: Traverse right from the belay, climb corners and cracks to the summit. An alternative pitch (cleaner and a bit harder) is to climb the top pitch of Fear of Flying. For this pitch, walk left on the belay ledge to a large cedar and climb a dirty crack to a ledge with a double-bolt belay. Pass this belay and climb the unlikely face above following cracks. 5.10a  Other Information: The video Uncommon Ground (2002, Chance Productions/Robert Frost) has a section showing climbing Creation of the World.  Climbing Magazine featured the Adirondacks in an article by Jeff Achey (Climbing #150, March 1995, page 102).

Start the climb by walking up beside a hulking knob of anorthosite amidst a sea of debris. Thereafter, the slab varies in slope as it ascends some 400 feet to the convergence of the tracks.    Scrambling transitions into low to mid fifth class climbing above the lower tracks.     An obvious, though dirty, crack dissects steep bulges of freshly exposed anorthosite on either side. Above, the Upper Dihedral, a stunning corner with a finger-crack ascends steeply before transitioning to an exposed traversewhat I consider the crux of the slide. You can climb using only the slab on small holds or via the crack depending on your comfort and skill level. A boulder below an overlap (about 100 feet up and surrounded by dirt) makes a good belay point. Climbing up small overlaps and bulges continues as the width of the slide narrows.    The final pitch seems to end at what I call the Capstone, a thick ledge that forms a small roof over the slab.

The route is straight forward to follow and would be a great introduction for those wishing to break away from the crag scene. While this line may not be the cleanest (some loose rock and intermittent grassy areas) it is still a worthwhile excursion that will reward you with breathtaking views from the summit.    The crack is pretty easy to find, just keep walking left across the slabs until you reach a foot sized crack near the middle of the face.    Pitch 1 - Climb a low angle foot crack for about 150ft, belay at 2 pitons.      Pitch 2 - Continue up the crack for about 100ft until you reach a ledge at the headwall.

Rainbow Slide - Over the Rainbow,111928966,Trad,106057854,5.6,500,4,2.0,1.0,"Without a doubt the hardest part of this climb was the approach that we took.  Adirondack Rock advises to hike up to the Pyramid-Gothics col and drop down to the East.  Good advice !  The directions are a bit complex so will not be repeated here.      We chose to leave the Weld trail (from Lower Ausable Lake) early and bushwhack up the ""drainage"".  The going started OK along a streambed, then we left the streambed and took a line towards the slab.  A patch of serious blowdown slowed progress. Our ascent was in 2004 and ""Pre-Irene"" so one can only imagine that the blowdown got worse, not better.     Eventually we emerged from the blowdown of cris-crossed trees into a beautiful ""dell"" of moss and ferns, then we continued up a slab (lead photo) through more open forest to the lower, very low-angle slab.    P1 - Recollection is that we roped up (more because there was a nice, flat place to do so)for easy pitch which led up near (recollection is 20-25 ft below, but it might be more) the base of the left-arching overlap (of ""Pot of Gold 5.7"") 2007, Haas, Rosecrans & Livingston). 200 ft 5.4    P2 - Up and right on flake(s) and friction, and establish a belay.  Recollection is about 75-100 ft??? 5.5 - 5.6 and I remember slinging something (flake, horn??) as part of the belay.    P3 - Start off right-ish, then straight up to a small (10 ft high, 1-2 ft ""deep"") inside corner and belay at the piton left in place.  100-120 ft, more??   5.5 - 5.6    P4 - Up and left on easier terrain but with limited protection points to the trees.  about 100-120?? ft  5.2-5.4      Certainly, pitches can be combined (as seems to be described in ""Adk Rock"") but on unknown friction like this, when I find a solid belay I usually stop...one never knows when the next one will show up!         From the tree(s) reached, using a single 200ft/60m rope, we were able to lower down, place a directional cam in a small overlap/flake that was about 50+/- ft down and to climber's right, then from there lower down nearly directly to the corner of what would become ""Pot of Gold"". I remember we reached below the overlap, but forget how far down the corner. Maybe 1/2 way down??   Bob and Ed both TR'd this high-quality pitch.             Exit -  I remember that Ed continually said ""I've got the exit route"". From the tree we moved up and right to a low-angle but scary-due-to-damp-moss slab which we eventually climbed out of into the bushwhack to the trail.         The photo in ""Adk Rock"", taken from the side, appears to show very little bushwhacking, I think that in reality we spent more time in the high-angle trees and bushes than on the slide.  Certainly, looking at the slide ""face on"" from the top of Indian Head and/or the Lower Boathouse, the top of the ""exit slide"" is a ways from the ridge crest (and hence the trail) than it appears from the side view.",{108310475: 2}

South Face Gothics Direct,111922591,Trad,106057854,5.10d,400,3,3.7,6.0,"P1 and P2 are two of the most stunning pitches I have done in 50 years of climbing. Fantastic rock, fantastic setting.     Originally rated 5.10a, a hold broke off in 2013 (after my ascents) and now the first pitch is given a 5.10d. If you rap in from the top (i.e. APPROACH 2) you could ( especially with a 70m rope, and with a few judicious quickdraws as directionals) TR the 5.10d first pitch if that's a bit much for leading.        The guidebook gives it a ""G"" and 4 stars, but I would give it a ""PG"" rating. In places if you ""blow it"" just below the next protection you could take a 25-30 footer (it's not a sport climb) and that's not a good idea this far into the mountains. Since Mountainproject goes from ""G"" to ""PG-13"" (""which seems to have originally meant ""PG/R"") I picked the more conservative ""PG-13"". You're 10 miles into the Adirondack Wilderness, and the way ""out"" is UP! (Not down as with most climbs.)     If you don't like strenuous overhangs (strenuous, IMO, either free or on aid) just take the original ""5.3"" finish. I've done the climb twice, including one of the earliest ascents, and prefer the original P3 as it is more in character with the first two pitches, and with most of the other climbing on this cliff.     FA of P1 & P2  by Ed Palen & Vinny McClelland in 2002 with the ""5.3 P3 finish"".     The ""direct finish"" (guide says 5.9, some have said up to 5.11; this climber did it as A-1 !)  was by Chris Hyson & Tom Yandon in 2004.     APPROACH- One of two ways:    1) Via the Pyramid-Gothics col. Descend to the west down the faint drainage to the base of the slabs of the So. Face. (Some may want to rap a pitch, see more detail in the ""Arch Route""). Wander left along the base to the start of the ""Original Route"". Climb up this for ?? feet until the route can be seen on the clean slab to your right.   2) Recommended - Descend west from the summit of Gothics on the Range Trail. Here I'm hazy, but the guidebook (Lawyer & Haas, Adirondack Rock) says 0.1 mile to a herd path/climber's-path on the left. Down this to a slab (care !... rope up? ) to where you can traverse west (skiier's right) at the top of an exposed slab (more care !!, some may wish a rope) The rap tree is 20-25 ft back, up in the bushes. Replace/extend the rap slings.    A single 60m will make the raps, but a 70m makes for more happiness!    Rap to the ""Grand Piano Ledge"", then rap to the mid-cliff belay on a small grassy ledge, then rap (swinging to rappeller's left at the bottom) to the corner/crack of the ""Original Route"".    START- When I was there last there was an old, rusty 1 1/4 (or 1 1/2) inch angle piton in the crack, a green (# 0.75) Camalot works well too.    P1- Follow the route up the clean, white rock. Quite sustained, nearly every move is 5.6 to 5.8, with the crux moves harder, of course. End on a grassy ledge with the dbl bolt belay at its right end. about 100 ft  5.10d     P2- When I last climbed the route, I thought this was crux pitch (excepting the direct P3 overhang).

Easy (5.5 +/-) slab to the top. 90-100 ft guidebook says 5.9 I used aid and found even that strenuous.

From the trail, bushwhack onto an area of sandy wash and continue up. The first half of the slide follows a narrow, twisting track along a stream and involves a few short scrambles. At about half height, the route opens onto a broad slab that continually steepens as it approaches the summit. The rock has had less than 20 years to weather, so it has tons of friction and makes a couple of improbable-looking swells easy. 3/4 of the way up, jog right through an obvious gap onto a parallel slide that quickly grows much steeper.

Trap Dike (summer),106066142,Trad,106066089,4th,2000,1,3.8,98.0,"On a summer day in 1850, two workers from the McIntyre Iron Company (Now the Upper Works trailhead) set out to stand on top of the unclimbed Mt. Colden, an Adirondack High Peak named after an investor of the Iron Works. Since no trail existed, the pair started up the only weakness in the Mountain, a large dike on the west side that spilled into Avalanche Lake. They followed the dike up the mountain until the walls disappeared. They soon found themselves ascending an exposed slide into the unknown. A few hundred feet of scrambling lead to the summit. Later that night, the pair celebrated their first ascent by killing a deer and cooking it over a fire.    Relive their adventure by climbing the original (and still the best) route up the mountain. I wouldn't recommend cooking a deer over a fire afterwards though, I think the rangers would be pissed.     The route climbs the obvious dike over easy 3rd-4th class rock. The crux is a 30ft rock staircase next to a waterfall. As you climb higher in the dike, the walls will shrink until its possible to climb out right onto the slide. It is VERY important not to exit the dike at the first chance. The slide here is very steep with no gear. A few parties have made this mistake having no technical rock experience or clean underwear and needed to be rescued. Stay in the dike until the 2nd or 3rd exit.

Case Route,109646624,Trad,106444637,5.5,1000,6,2.5,4.0," An ""easy way up"" the central depression of Wallface. A combination of; scrambling, you choose when to rope up, tree island linking, climbing, then getting back down. Given highest grade because of the greatness of the ""sum of the parts"" .. a true wilderness climbing experience with a little bit of everything, good and bad.   Many thanks, and all credit goes to Steve R. for the following detailed description..   "" The Case route zig-zags up"" the rock buttresses to climbers right of the central depression. Aside from the start you do not climb within the central depression per se. There are 7 pitches (one short slab traverse followed by 6 ledges [or 3 zig-zags]). This route mostly follows a series of ledges covered with grass and trees. The route's line can be somewhat visualized from Summit Rock by following the tree-lined ledge system to climbers right of the central depression.    P1 - Start 10-20 feet to the right of the highest point of land below the central depression of Wallface. A Climb 30 feet straight up very easy (low 5th class), but unprotected,  wet/dry scrambling . Once, you reach  a small ledge, traverse right 70 feet to a tree island,  below a large rock buttress, the traverse protects fairly . (You may want to put your climbing shoes away at this point--the rest of the route is mostly on grass and/or rocky ledges where a semi-rigid alpine boot works best.  P2 - Traverse ~180ft right along a grass and tree covered ledge until you see the next obvious ramp, which goes upwards and to the left. There is also old tat here. This, as well as the subsequent pitches, have the occasional boulder or rock move to navigate over and/or around. (P2: the first zig right)  P3 - Climb a tree, rock, and grass covered ramp up and left ~140ft. Awkward moves around boulders and trees. Some exposurerie . Once again there's some old tat to belay from. You know to stop here because you can see the next, somewhat obvious tree and grass covered ramp leading up and right (look for the easiest option). Climbing further left leads you into the central depression--you do not want to go in this direction. (Of note, one continues along this ramp into the central depression if you want to climb Weissner's Route, which is a different 5.5 climb--see guide book). (P3: the first zag left)  4 - Follow the tree, rock, and grass covered ramp up and right ~120ft and belay from moderately sized alcove. This belay station is protected and comfortable. Once again build a gear anchor or use old tat, if present. The next ramp up and left is obvious and marks where you should stop. (P4: the second zig right)  P5 - Once again follow the ramp up and left. This pitch is shorter than the previous 3 (~100ft). This pitch has a rock move or two in the middle that is mid-5th class and readily protectable, both before and after the moves. You belay from a well-protected spot within a small grove of pine trees. You can see and coach your second through the rock moves from this belay spot. There is old tat present. (P5: the second zag left) P6 - Longer that P5 (~150ft). Go up and right along the ramp system of least resistance. Starting this pitch stay low at first, wrestle with a l tree, then gain ttl he b ramp (versus going straight up to gain the ramp). About halfway there's another move or two of mid 5th class rock with great exposure. It's readily protectable with a #2 or #3 BD cam before, and a old piton after. There is a jug for hands and a crack large enough to jam a stiff boot perfectly. Next, continue along the ramp around a chossy bulge (or buttress) to nice belay spot in an alcove high and right. (There will be significant rope drag around this chossy buldge and you will be out of communication with your second. Alternatively, this pitch can be split into two with the leader belaying just past the rock moves--this latter option is not great because the gear options are limited). (P6: third zig right)  P7 - Take the long grassy, rocky, and tree-strewn ramp ~180 to the top. This ramp is obvious and easier than the previous two pitches. Some rock moves, but they're low 5th class. About 20ft from the belayer, stay climbers left over the top and outside of a large boulder (i.e. not between the boulder and rock wall, where a tree blocks you're progress--the second, however, may be forced to go between the boulder and the wall due to rope tensiong, ). Follow the ramp up and left with good gear to you reach a small tree, place a directional, then climb the mossy ground above the rock face to an old tat anchor in the small trees about 25 above the cliff. You will be out of communication with your second.  DESCENT: Adirondack Rock recommends to bushwack off--not to rappel. I would agree. The rap stations were all old tat attached to suspect features and small trees (Fall 2018). Plus there is significant risk of getting your rope caught and too many random tat stations to know exactly where to go. That said, with new slings, etc. this route can be rapped. We walked off to climber left. It probably took 2 hours to get back to the trail. First summit Wallface mountain by nasty bushwhacking. Just south of the summit is a large football field sized of cut down trees (maybe as a helicopter rescue point?). From here the bushwhacking is easier with the occasional faint trail. The faint trail follows near the cliff edge to the east and likely meets up with the potential walk-off option from ""The Diagonal."" From here the route south and then south east is marked by pink ribbons on tree branches. The bushwhacking is easy here. You eventually drop into a wide col south of the Wallface summit. From here you follow the pink ribbons more east back around the southern margin of the Wallface cliff. Here we lost track of pink ribbons (or they stopped), and just went directly down to where the Indian Pass trail and the Diagonal approach trail (which is different and more south than where The Case route approach trail) meet. This was mostly eastward around the occasional cliff band and stream covered slides. This bushwack was moderate in October--but like dangerous in the dark, due the sudden and occasional drop-offs.

Free Ride,107605039,Trad,106444637,5.11a,735,8,3.5,11.0,"Awesome hard route up clean, good rock. Full disclaimer: I only climbed to the top of the 4th pitch; the pitches above were wet and there was a Peregrine Nest on the 5th pitch ledge. If someone who has done the full route wants to take over this page, feel free. I just wanted to add it because its such an awesome route.    Pitch 1. 11a 70ft.    -Climb up the right facing corner with 10a-ish stemming until you can clip the bolt. Bust left on crimps (crux) until you can pull around the arete. Climb the face (protect with small cam) up to the ledge and belay. Can be linked with the next pitch. The grade seemed right for the crux but the pitch was very accessible at the grade, because the hard climbing is brief and bolt protected. I had more trouble on the sandbagged second pitch.    Pitch 2. 10a (sandbag) 100ft.   -Climb the obvious thin crack over two tricky overlaps. The first one felt 5.9-10a, but the second one felt sandbagged to me unless I was missing something. I had more trouble on it than the crux of the first pitch. Place a small cam, grab the good fingerlock, reach up to the crimp, and pull over the overlap onto the slab, pinching the edge of a small left facing corner. The crack was wet in parts when I did it, but the wet bits didn't seem like they'd be good holds anyway. After this bulge continue of the easy offwidth above and belay at a two bolt anchor.    Pitch 3 in the Lawyer guidebook is a scramble to the base of the shield (large clean slab of rock with few features). We felt comfortable not belaying this out as a pitch, and just wandering up to the shield and re-flaking the rope.    Pitch 3 10a 100ft.   -Look for a 6ft pillar sticking out of the steep slab. The third pitch of Free Ride climbs the right side of it. Traverse in easily from the left, clip a bolt, do some cruxy slab moves to get to the base of the pillar, and place gear in a crack on the left side of the pillar. Layback the crack and make an easy mantle onto the pillar. Clip another bolt, and climb straight up the slab, clip up another bolt, and move left to a flake. Place a couple of pieces of gear behind the flake and pull over the overlap (second crux). Climb past one more bolt to a two bolt anchor.  Very good pitch. The guidebook calls this and the next pitch some of the best face climbing on the east coast. I agree. You can link this pitch with the next one with a 60m rope.    Pitch 4 5.9+ pg-13 100ft.    -Similar climbing to the last pitch, but with more bolts and less gear. There is (what felt to me to be) a substantial run-out between the 1st and second bolt. When leading I wanted a bolt or piece of gear right in between the two bolts; they are spaced about twice as far apart as the other bolts. But the climbing between the two bolts is about 5.8. But I still found it spicy. The pitch doesnt have a distinct crux; each section by a bolt felt like a 5.9 slab move to me. Linking this pitch with the 3rd made a beautiful, sustained, mentally draining 200 ft pitch of sustained yet varied and interesting slab climbing.     -At the fourth pitch belay, a peregrine started warning dives and calls towards me. Additionally, the upper corners were soaking wet, even though the rest of the route was mostly dry. We rappelled, so the information for the second half is from the guidebook and what I saw. Anyone who has climbed the full route, feel free to offer a better description. I hope to get back in the fall and complete the route.    Pitch 5. 10a 60ft?    -Really short looking pitch, mainly scrambling up bushy ledges, with the crux coming at a 15ft slab protected by a single bolt. Ends on the Lunch Ledge   Pitch 6. 11a. 80ft?    -Climb the overhanging corner on the left side of the lunch ledge. There looks to be a finger sized crack in the corner, and in the second half of the corner the angle eases. Belay at a fixed anchor at the obvious base of the beautiful Endurance Corner.   Pitch 7. 10d 80ft?    -Climb the beautiful and continuous corner to a stance under the roof at the top. It looks to protect with hand sized cams, and there are three bolts in a row in the second half of the pitch.   Pitch 8. 10c. 70ft?    -The Houdini Traverse. Traverse left under the roof for about 40ft with great exposure, passing several bolts. At the end of the roof, climb straight up the steep face to the top of the cliff.  The first half of this route is really good, on much better and cleaner rock than the popular Diagonal. The second half of the route looks even better, especially the last two pitches.

Little Finger Direct,106092527,Trad,106092131,5.7,700,4,3.6,14.0,"History: For some time the route known as ""Bill's Route"" (""4 bolts on a face to the right of Little Finger"") has been mistaken for Little Finger Direct [""LFD""] , even though route descriptions for LFD clearly state that the climb starts only 10-15 ft right of base of Little Finger. (See COMMENT below from the leader of the FA.) The issue, I guess, is that protection is non-existent for well over 100 ft.  Indeed, I can't say that I led this climb...5.7+ X is ""a bit above my pay grade"", but did climb it about 10-12 years ago by rigging a 2-rope top rope from one of the anchors on Little Finger and then using a directional off (I think) a wire stopper in one of the thin cracks about 140-160 ft up. The climbing moves are superb and if the occasion presents itself (i.e. you're not ""hogging"" the anchor on LF) this is a reasonable way to do this ""very 'X' route""  I spoke with Jim Kolcotronis (of the FA party of Little Finger itself) the weekend after the FA of Little Finger and the description he gave me at that time was that the 5.7 3rd pitch crack was the route of FA, and thus the 5.5 ""exit to the right"" was added later. (by whom ?)  START: about 10-15 ft right of little finger, on sort of a ""mini butress"" about 20(?) feet high.  Tom Rosecrans continues: ...climb[ed] the face about 10' right of Little Finger, unprotected except for a poor upside down pin at about half height, belaying in the left facing corner just right of LF. Here the idea of a totally separate line failed and it was back to LF to just below the roof with P-3 taking the classic finger crack above.   P1- Climb the unprotected face 10 ft right of Little Finger. 5.7 to 5.7+ X   P2- Continue up reaching thin cracks that take small wires (or pitons !) but when the climbing thins out, work left to the belay below the base of the P3 5.7 crack.  P3- Climb over the small overhang, then up the fine crack (this is the normal P3 of the ""Direct variation"" to LF.)   Belay on a sloping slab with a fine crack that accepts small TCUs and/or little-finger-sized-wire-nuts.  DESCENT- The best descent is to climb up 20-25 ft and slightly left (piton in a 2-3 ft high right-facing flake) then traverse 50-70 ft to the double bolt anchor on Screaming Meanie and rap that route with 2 ropes.  It is also possible to move right and rap the gully to the right, but there is lose rock there.","{107902567: 4, 200293863: 4, 106873076: 4, 109411206: 4, 109936563: 4, 109135839: 4, 108905794: 4, 106985791: 4, 111737693: 4, 109222097: 3, 108547663: 3, 111898188: 3, 109414386: 3, 108310475: 3}"

The future will no doubt see those better parts incorporated into better routes.   Climb through the awkward notch on the left side of the boulder to a stance, then go up the crevice rightward, entering a cave. There's a ""glory hole"" on the right; it is a very tight squeeze. Work through it to a small chamber with another glory hole on the right, which leads to open air quite a ways up the cliff. There's a dirty gully/chimney heading upward behind you when you first exit the cave. Head up it to the second oak tree and belay.   P2: Climb up to the second horizontal break to the left, make an awkward move out left onto it, and traverse across the exposed face until you are above a stunted oak tree (if you are soloing, this is your only hope of salvation in a fall). Look for a column of knobs in this vicinity, and climb them to the next horizontal break. Go through this to the next face, step left, find a vertical crack buried in dirt, and claw your way up it, expressing great disappointment when it runs out shy of the next ledge. Suck it up and do a couple friction moves to safety.   P3: Wander left up the dirt cone, and traverse (again, awkwardly) left under an overhanging obstacle to easy ground along a horizontal break.

We set out to find ""South Summit Route"" but, due to a combination of a slightly geriatric brain which juxtaposed the directions from Adirondack Rock ""1"" and ""2"" and a decision to ""just start up and look around"" we seemed to have stumbled upon this route.     APPROACH - From the ""landmark"" boulder go directly into the woods toward the cliff (faint path soon peters out). Go about 40 ft, then turn left down the very slight 'gully' for about another 40 ft. Then follow broken branches up right-ish towards the cliff. Look for an open, brownish slab about 10-12 ft wide and 25-30 ft high (photo) with a small open area at its base.     P1 - Start on the slab/ramp, a foot or two right of the ""arete"". Climb the slab (pro on the right in a crack, one placement dug out) past the first tree, continue on the ramp-like feature past a 2nd and 3rd tree, then step left to avoid contact with some stacked blocks. Belay with your feet near the top of the blocks, which are more stable than they looked from below.  120 ft  5.4      P2 - Step left, climb the nice cracks (photo) then easy roped scrambling to belay at a pine tree. 60 +/- ft  5.3-5.4     Here we were just left of a beautiful 30-40 ft wide, 30-40 ft high clean slab with a horizontal crack/ledge running along its entire base about 10 ft up. ( ""P3"" photo)   The slab looked devoid of protection, and leading it ""solo"" seemed ""above my pay grade"".  An attempt to circumvent it to the right, so as to get to its top to Top Rope it, was frustrated by more trees so we rapped off, leaving it for someone better equipped, either mentally or mechanically (or both).

New Frontier,108228535,Trad,105798956,5.11b,245,2,2.0,1.0,"New Frontier is an adventurous outing that has some really great climbing on the last pitch which weaves an improbable path through one of the biggest roof systems in Millbrook. Surprisingly, there is little roof climbing at all - rather a series wildly exposed corners and traverses that are almost reminiscent of features one might find on granite. Unfortunately this fun pitch is guarded by one-to-two pitches of dirty, loose rock. If only there were a way to rap in and just sample the upper bit...    For this route to deserve the classic status it has been given in various guidebooks, I really think it would take a ton more traffic to clean it up, but what do I know?    Rap down to the GT Ledge and find your way to the base of the route which can be identified by a patch of yellow, broken rock with a long, 3' deep roof about 30' off the ground. Above this roof is a long, narrow right-facing corner and to the right of this corner are two large bushes, one above the other. Your goal is to pull through the roof directly below this corner, and then climb the corner squeezing past the bushes on your right, eventually working back left and up into the massive right-facing corners and roofs at the top of the wall.    P1: Climb hollow, yellow rock and pull the low roof with some difficulty. Climb easily up the right-facing corner above, passing the first bush. At the second bush, step left out of the corner, around the arete, and onto a narrow ramp that leads up and left underneath a double-tiered, clean white roof - this is the ""Gottlieb Variation"" (recommended) - the original route continues all the way up to the top of the corner. Climb through the center of the clean white roof at a thin crack and pull up to a long, shale-filled horizontal. Traverse straight left for 25' in this horizontal to a series of huge, frightening, stacked blocks. Gingerly climb up over these and belay on a small ledge at the base of a large, clean right-facing corner capped by a massive roof. This is a long pitch and to do it without rope drag one must runner their gear extremely well. Otherwise an intermediate belay may be required. Also, despite guidebook descriptions, the Gottlieb Variation is well-protected and only about 5.9. All in all, this pitch checks in at mid-5.10 and possibly R due to loose rock, but there is adequate pro.    P2: Climb up the corner above and undercling and crimp rightwards around the roof. It may be best to use extra long runners here or back clean all of this gear to eliminate rope drag on the crux. Continue up flakey rock to an incut slot (crucial large nut and/or 1"" cam - Red Alien or 0.5 Camalot is perfect). Get ready: Bust a series of powerful moves on great side pulls to gain a hanging corner with a thin crack and more gear. A fall from here would be massive, but if you miss the small slab it would be otherwise clean. If you hit the slab... well... it could be 5.11 R, but it's hard to say. The important consideration is you're doing the crux of the whole climb pretty far out (10+ feet) from your last pieces. Once in the corner, arrange great gear and work up to the next roof, traverse left out the roof and around an incredibly exposed arete. Continue up another corner and once again work left out the roof and around another, even more exposed arete. Continue up the final corner and mantle over the top onto pine needles and duff. All of the climbing post-crux is well protected. 5.11b-ish, R-ish.",{10168: 2}

This way you can know how to climb out of Millbrook if you need to or want to, especially in some kind of emergency.     To get to the North end of the Grand Traverse Ledge starting from Trapps Bridge follow the carriage road along the back of the Near Trapps and find the Bayards Path which will lead you to the ridge between the Near Trapps and Bayards. Follow the Ridge Trail along the top of Bayards to climb Millbrook ridge. [As a side note, in the wet seasons there is a spring that runs over the trail at this point just before the Ridge Trail starts to ascend Millbrook Mountain. You can fill up your water bottles here.]      Climbing up in elevation abruptly you will eventually reach the edge of the actual cliff edge of Millbrook Mountain by means of a few camel backs. Part way to edge of the actual cliff you will meet a rock that is 5 foot high and 10 long where the trail goes around it on the right. I am going to call this rock the ""GTL Stone"", because it is very near the level of the Millbrook Grand Traverse Ledge. Keep this in mind as you pass this rock.

Do not climb this ridge.]      At the base of this stone ridge depart from the trail going left and parallel to the trail to then traverse along the cliff South East past some small caves to a finger of rock that points south opposite a very short smooth North facing corner.

There is a lot of traversing, so try to avoid placing too much gear and use long slings.","{107246852: 4, 108857846: 4, 200363928: 4, 106993942: 4, 106209804: 4, 107629487: 4, 111169936: 3, 107093945: 3, 107548455: 3, 106125724: 3, 111882861: 3, 107376074: 3, 108082584: 3, 110148121: 3, 107544688: 3, 107548227: 3, 106858324: 3, 107464151: 3, 107355157: 3, 10270: 3, 200345231: 3, 200187164: 3, 108793472: 3, 108103821: 3, 112343811: 3, 106158262: 3, 105899248: 3, 106087077: 3, 106297607: 3, 111308179: 3, 107400819: 3, 106347425: 3, 105790750: 3, 107561935: 3, 107618553: 3, 106403737: 2, 105889415: 2, 106596992: 2, 106022427: 2, 107254662: 2, 110165451: 2, 105961696: 2, 109316126: 2, 13364: 2, 106299993: 2, 112042073: 2, 106173169: 2, 107678965: 2, 107232016: 2, 105851541: 2, 109816235: 2, 108104429: 2, 107768989: 2, 107238223: 2, 105891309: 2, 106953954: 2, 106146571: 2, 106607660: 2, 106762873: 2, 106290147: 2, 105904878: 2, 110619029: 2, 106897206: 2, 105892598: 2, 106394053: 2, 106999733: 2, 109018466: 2, 106210225: 2, 106263368: 2}"
Broken Sling,105803592,Trad,108142189,5.8+,140,2,3.1,108.0,"One of the 5.8 testpieces of the Gunks:  the ""+"" refers to the starting move (certainly harder than 5.8), and to the scary start of the 2nd pitch.    Although short, this climb is often done in 2 pitches to avoid rope drag.    This climb is easy to recognize - it is not far from where the trail brings you to the cliff, and is between the overhanging hand crack of Criss Cross Direct and the huge roof to the right of Disneyland.  Broken Sling starts at a left-facing arete just under a right-facing corner and roof.    P1: Locate an obvious boulder problem just right of a low roof.  A large jug about 10' up dares you to grab it.  The moves up through this are surprisingly tricky - you're definitely risking a twisted ankle or worse.  You can protect with a cam on the left (tough to place) or just go for it and place a piece from the big jug.  Borrow a crash pad or bring a beefy spotter.  Once your feet are on the jug all is well, but there's a lot more climbing ahead.    Above, move up to a small roof, turn it on the left, then climb up meandering towards a large alcove with a fixed anchor.  Belay here to avoid rope drag. 5.8+, 75'.    P2: Climb out right of the alcove.  A pin that once protected the traverse is gone now, so this part is hard to protect.  You can make a long reach straight up if you're tall, or, as most people do, quake right, up, and left on minimal pro to easier ground.  A bit more climbing leads to the top. 5.8 PG, 65'.    ...More details on P2 from Kurtz:  Belay on a small ledge 15 ft below the rap anchor (it's a better stance).  The first moves up a hollow flake aren't hard or scary but the pro is suspect until you can sling the anchor webbing (V2).  Traverse right (20+ ft) until you find enough holds to move up to the overhang. Then traverse all the way back left on good hands but minimal feet until you are beneath a weakness in the roof. Set a bomber piece here and go! Easier climbing above, to the clifftop.    V2: From the rap anchor at the start of P2, go straight up the flaring crack through an overhang (5.9+ PG).  This avoids the traverses on the regular route.    Walk along the cliff to climbers' right, then before the road, scramble back down to the cliff base.","{11926: 4, 105880131: 4, 105811636: 4, 107730254: 4, 106299993: 4, 107299797: 4, 105904878: 4, 105859992: 4, 10150: 4, 105804842: 4, 106607660: 4, 106687445: 4, 106125724: 4, 106298729: 4, 106263368: 4, 106394111: 4, 107185927: 4, 109816235: 4, 108363423: 4, 108843325: 4, 106238291: 4, 108857846: 4, 111169936: 4, 110148121: 4, 107629487: 4, 109187861: 4, 106209804: 4, 13364: 4, 112091216: 4, 200120733: 4, 107618553: 3, 105832216: 3, 10610: 3, 12448: 3, 106020445: 3, 105846944: 3, 105831725: 3, 107658399: 3, 106071787: 3, 106089213: 3, 106117267: 3, 106041457: 3, 105961696: 3, 105899248: 3, 106344939: 3, 106087077: 3, 14595: 3, 106588732: 3, 106762873: 3, 106848900: 3, 105790750: 3, 105899901: 3, 105851541: 3, 106290147: 3, 106794436: 3, 106022427: 3, 108082584: 3, 107304112: 3, 107238223: 3, 108367150: 3, 107178254: 3, 105812807: 3, 106325770: 3, 108201220: 3, 106932322: 3, 107771322: 3, 109646398: 3, 108052600: 3, 109193524: 3, 105890911: 3, 107755397: 3, 107929356: 3, 111781359: 3, 108014034: 3, 105823713: 3, 107469778: 3, 11690: 3, 111777299: 3, 106879280: 3, 107232016: 3, 108793472: 3, 107412430: 3, 110409351: 3, 109414386: 3, 200067404: 3, 111850994: 3, 109005921: 3, 105892598: 3, 10270: 3, 108329997: 3, 107246852: 3, 106822110: 2, 106999733: 2, 107400819: 2, 107671020: 2, 105811146: 2, 106637976: 2, 106441937: 2, 107518458: 2, 110998345: 2, 110619029: 2, 106897206: 2, 200158745: 2, 106205646: 1, 107097681: 1, 107429065: 1, 108103821: 1, 111857489: 1}"

Easy Rider,108860828,Trad,108142189,5.9,790,10,3.3,7.0,"This is a surprisingly partial traverse of the Near Trapps. We still felt very close to the overlook when we topped out. Ten pitches take you from the foot of the cliff to the top of Gelsa via a lot of moderate climbing with a few routefinding and technical cruxes. Best climbed on low-traffic days because it intersects many popular routes. Don't forget the camera on this one. I don't know if anyone continues on past Gelsa but it's theoretically possible...    P1 5.8+ PG 80':   (Same as Outer Space) Starting from the high point/boulder pile/nose slab climb up and then slightly right around a bulge to an overhang with a protruding rectangular block. Crank up and clip a piton, then make a difficult traverse left on small holds and up to a thank god jug and then a horizontal with good gear. Traverse left 10 or so feet to notch and then up through, moving left again along hand rail past another notch to an awkward finish and belay at the prow.     P2 5.6 G 115':   Climb left and slightly up on lichen and ledges for 30 ft 5.5 PG. Step down a few moves to a finger horizontal below an overlap and make a long traverse left to a stance in the notch (on Broken Sling) in the overhangs. Climb through the notch and step left to make a belay.     P3 5.7 G 100':   Step down and lieback into a diagonal rail/jug. Place gear and make a reachy step left (crux) to  better holds. Move left and reverse the Disneyland pitch 2 traverse. There are some pumpy downclimb/traverse moves with great protection. Move left past flakes in the horizontal and keep moving left until you spot a wide open book. (Intersects Swing Time and Te Dum here). Make a belay on great gear in the open book.     P4 5.7 G 50':   Step down(or up, depending on where you make the belay) to a 10"" sloping ledge with a few small, loose, blocks. Traverse left and around a nose and eventually make a step-across to large boulders above the Inverted Layback crux. Continue another 20' to spacious ledges on Layback. We used this as a nice break in the middle of the climb.     P5 5.2 G 40':   Climb left on an amazing and airy 5.2 traverse past a nose/arete to a semi-hanging belay on small ledges.    P6* 5.9 G/PG 75':   Traverse left past small nose on good horizontals to piton. Step down to disguised horizontal rift for feet and small edges for hands. Move left to the Alphonse corner. Continue left with hands on Alphonse's lower horizontal to Alphonse's optional belay on a small arete. From there you can spot the next belay: at an awkward rap station near questionable blocks on Yellow Belly. I chose to belay down and right of this on more solid rock.    This is where things got interesting for us. After the piton, I continued left to a small horizontal (BD #00 and #000) below the ceiling. There are good high feet and good low hands but I couldn't figure it out and had to use 3 points of aid (including a sketchy #00 in poor rock that left me hanging by one lobe and another #00 that later pulled when my partner fell following the pitch) to get to a key ""jug"" and gear placement just right of the Alphonse corner and directly across from the foot crack of Alphonse's leftward traverse. This is the crux of the route and Dick Williams's guidebook clocks it at 5.9-. After studying the limited available beta in print I think that I missed a key horizontal about 10' down from the piton for feet. Would love to hear from others about their experiences with this pitch. The above beta is the best I can piece together from what I saw and the pictures we took.    P7 5.6 G 35':    Move left of the rap station along a horizontal and meet up with Yellow Ridge's 2nd pitch traverse and use its belay.     P8 5.7 PG, 70':   Climb the first part of Yellow Ridge's 3rd pitch to a stance at a piton on a small prow. Step down and left to slanting horizontals and make long step to a slab. Up the slab and left to a horizontal with many small flakes (careful what you pull on here). Move about 12' left and downclimb (follower risks a shitty fall here) just past the lichen to a ledge system. Move left to a tat belay on Baskerville.      Pitch 9 5.3 G, 120':   Diagonal up and left to a pin and then continue left following the path of least resistance for about 60' past chain anchor to where it seems convenient to diagonal down and left onto a ramp/slab. Downclimb a few ""crux"" moves to an easier ledge that leads to a gear belay in the massive right-facing corner of Gelsa.    Pitch 10 5.4 G, 110':   Climb the up and traverse left then up past a notch(crux) and continue to the top.","{107629487: 4, 107246852: 4, 107093945: 3, 107238223: 3, 107768989: 3, 111857489: 3, 111850994: 3}"
Fat City Direct,105798943,Trad,108142189,5.10d,150,1,3.9,86.0,"This is the best route in the Nears -- it weaves its way up an impossible-looking wave of rock at an accessible grade and on almost entirely natural pro. I believe it is typically done in two or three pitches (there is a bolted belay midcliff, but it makes for a spectacular single pitch -- just use lots of long runners. The Fat City wall is pretty obvious: 'Direct starts below a small roof with a hand crack in it. This area is before you reach the Birdland area.  You get a good rest before the crux, then you must perform a difficult move up to an undercling, pull right of this, and then up to a cramped stance. The crux is pulling out of this small roof/corner and is very well-protected. Good rests follow. Later on, head right and tackle the incredibly exposed, wild, second crux (protected by a 25-year-old fixed pin). There are a couple tricks to make these moves easier -- such as climbing very low and not clipping the pin until you have the jug just next to it. It's only 5.9+ or easy 5.10, but it gets the heart going. After that, you're in Fat City.

It possesses quite a bit of climbing with several 5.7 cruxes after the initial 5.8 traverse crux. The route finding is a little bit tricky.  Walk up the ramp to the base of the flaring off-width. Climb up and right to a horizontal crack below an overhang. Traverse right about 5 feet to gain good hands. At this point the book says to climb up the slab before traversing 10-12 feet right at a large horizontal. (I, however, continued to traverse right before climbing the right facing Gelsa corner for 5 feet.) No matter which route you take, you will find yourself at the base of a crack with several horizontal holds to its right. Continue to climb this crack/weakness up. You will eventually arrive at a small left facing corner 5-7 feet tall. Climb this and move around up and right to the bolted Fat City Direct belay/rap-station.

Don't pass this one up, even if you're climbing at a harder grade.    Start by a tree growing out and up from the base of the cliff (see first picture below), about 20' left of Fat City Direct, at a pile of boulders below a blocky crack.    P1: Climb the blocky crack up to an overhang at ~20 ft, and continue no further upwards! Instead, traverse left to a ledge and belay by a tree. 5.3, 45'.    P2: Continue traversing left (var) past an overhang and into an alcove (you'll be just above the bolts for Roseland), then back up right to a crack and a face.  Angle up left to a good ledge/alcove at the base of a huge, overhanging, right-facing corner, and make a belay on smaller gear here. 5.4, 60'.    Var: You can also diagonal up and left to the next belay, instead of traversing directly left.  You'll end up climbing a slab towards the belay alcove at 5.6 or so.    P3: The money pitch. Climb up right and up (or, up and right - either way works) and follow the steep, exposed corner to the top. 5.4, 90'.

It is known for its awkwardness, and is perhaps underappreciated.  It is one of the few climbs that are easier if you are short.  When I climbed it the other day, after the brief moment of disorientation and panic as I pulled the crux and squirmed on the cramped shelf, I had to laugh.  This climb is a trip, completely unlike any climb you'll ever find in a gym.  Do it, at least once.      Pitch 1:  Start at the thin vertical crack in the middle of the slab beneath a large chockstone.  Climb up to the top of the crack and then angle left to the left side of the chockstone.  Find a way to pull up onto the slanting, cramped shelf to the left of the chockstone (crux).  Somehow squirm left about 10-15 feet to a much more comfortable, easy ledge.  Traverse left another 15 feet or so on this easy ledge, to a rat's nest of slings.  I was told that many people simply rap here from the slings, but you shouldn't, because (a) the slings are total junk/faded/partially worn through, and (b) you still haven't finished the pitch!  From the rat's nest of slings, work your body up onto ANOTHER slanting, cramped shelf (easier than the first), worm your way to the left to a good stance and belay.  5.7-, 90 feet, much of it traversing.    Pitch 2:  This is a good, if short, pitch.  From the belay, move up and left on a great footrail to a notch in the small overhang, move above the overhang (nice 5.6 crux), and then traverse easily right until easy rock will take you to the top.  I think we may have traversed too far to the right, because when we headed up it was just a step or two to the bushes.  5.6, 70 feet, again much of it traversing.","{200145352: 4, 107768989: 3, 200120733: 3, 13364: 3, 11690: 2, 106897206: 2, 200240407: 2, 109585594: 2, 110425509: 2, 10270: 2, 107217526: 2, 200584942: 2, 106299993: 2, 106297607: 2, 106519306: 2, 106905703: 2, 107093945: 2, 109364349: 2, 107518458: 2, 111850994: 1, 106394111: 1, 107246852: 1, 107618553: 1, 108478944: 1}"

P2: Continue up the arete, then move left and up a thin face with poor pro to a cramped alcove below a roof.  Turn the roof on the left (crux, good pro) and continue to the top. 5.8+ PG, 90'.","{106549589: 4, 105892598: 4, 106297607: 4, 200041839: 4, 200054289: 4, 105904878: 4, 200067975: 4, 106290147: 4, 107238223: 3, 106125724: 3, 106486112: 3, 106579529: 3, 107548455: 3, 106932322: 3, 106209804: 3, 13364: 3, 107629487: 3, 106953954: 3, 10270: 3, 106299993: 3, 106235451: 3, 14595: 3, 106224522: 3, 106263368: 3, 106022427: 3, 10762: 3, 106108233: 3, 105851541: 2, 106897206: 2, 107246852: 2, 106325770: 2, 107561935: 2, 107400819: 2, 106205646: 2, 106394111: 2, 107093945: 2, 107254662: 2, 106298729: 2, 107767801: 0}"
Yellow Ridge,105799421,Trad,108142189,5.7,200,3,3.6,309.0,"Perhaps the best 5.7 in the Gunks.    This climb is just a few minutes from the road - you'll pass Disneyland and a number of inside and outside corners.  Immediately past Yellow Ridge is the huge roof of Fat Stick.  The route is most easily recognized by the left-leaning offwidth crack about 15' off the deck.    P1: There are two ways to start.  On the right is a left-facing corner leading up to a small roof - you traverse left under the roof to the offwidth crack (5.7 and reasonably protected).  A more direct start traverses on thin holds (no protection) to the rib below the offwidth crack and then up.  This is 5.7 and scary but a good spot will keep you safe.      In either case, attack the offwidth above.  At a horizontal you can either traverse right out of the crack and climb the face or be like Fritz and power up the offwidth.  Both of these are about 5.7.  Most people choose the face.    Continue to a good ledge just above the offwidth, and belay here.     P2: Climb a corner to a roof about 20' above the good ledge.  Instead of pulling through the roof, traverse up and left about 50' to a another good ledge.  5.7, 120'.    P3: Make thin moves traversing to the left edge of the ledge, and climb up just right of the obvious ridge for about 10'.  Traverse left to the arete, passing a pin.  Follow this up past another old pin to a roof (fortunately much easier than it looks!) and then on to the top. 5.7, 80'.    From the top, walk climbers' right along the clifftop until it is possible to easily scramble back down to the base, just before the road.","{107232016: 4, 11926: 4, 10762: 4, 10246: 4, 105813053: 4, 106022427: 4, 10510: 4, 106726952: 4, 12448: 4, 107519230: 4, 107228100: 4, 107629960: 4, 105896714: 4, 106381547: 4, 107493811: 4, 105880131: 4, 105889415: 4, 107561935: 4, 107125052: 4, 107093945: 4, 106299993: 4, 106680875: 4, 107663290: 4, 105831725: 4, 107525760: 4, 105904878: 4, 105943577: 4, 107902567: 4, 106297607: 4, 105946742: 4, 106097690: 4, 107548455: 4, 106108233: 4, 105804842: 4, 106087077: 4, 106011891: 4, 105892598: 4, 106549589: 4, 106347425: 4, 106488744: 4, 106263368: 4, 106719962: 4, 105790750: 4, 106591608: 4, 106001645: 4, 106852549: 4, 105886712: 4, 106933730: 4, 106822110: 4, 106607660: 4, 107026497: 4, 106971875: 4, 106430658: 4, 106762873: 4, 105851541: 4, 106503119: 4, 107002071: 4, 106971070: 4, 106794436: 4, 106596992: 4, 106571266: 4, 107246852: 4, 106985791: 4, 105891309: 4, 106993942: 4, 107185927: 4, 106905703: 4, 108082584: 4, 107767801: 4, 107323239: 4, 107518458: 4, 107304112: 4, 108205352: 4, 108104429: 4, 109856888: 4, 106697383: 4, 108104678: 4, 108344184: 4, 107394785: 4, 107548227: 4, 107226876: 4, 107273411: 4, 109364349: 4, 107553094: 4, 107852661: 4, 105798761: 4, 106932322: 4, 108363423: 4, 108000881: 4, 109646398: 4, 109816235: 4, 109525957: 4, 107723931: 4, 106178530: 4, 110232694: 4, 107914961: 4, 110359430: 4, 108680900: 4, 108401191: 4, 106398706: 4, 109018466: 4, 107574666: 4, 110779176: 4, 107587392: 4, 107417501: 4, 107194267: 4, 107629487: 4, 109284031: 4, 107146835: 4, 109142435: 4, 109620395: 4, 110619029: 4, 108394904: 4, 108367150: 4, 110948108: 4, 108321835: 4, 108981414: 4, 108540048: 4, 107297910: 4, 110315255: 4, 108843325: 4, 111781359: 4, 106912228: 4, 106210225: 4, 112004169: 4, 107544688: 4, 11690: 4, 107356939: 4, 111917126: 4, 111829790: 4, 110148121: 4, 106646308: 4, 107929356: 4, 111870350: 4, 107119283: 4, 108138324: 4, 112343811: 4, 106496735: 4, 107820617: 4, 200157339: 4, 109187861: 4, 111146152: 4, 107460666: 4, 107830036: 4, 107142289: 4, 111657384: 4, 110937405: 4, 107380650: 4, 109437284: 4, 109144070: 4, 111231935: 4, 106209804: 4, 110425509: 4, 111259774: 4, 200187164: 4, 110787439: 4, 200180118: 4, 200345231: 4, 110270698: 4, 200067404: 4, 112140841: 4, 110337843: 4, 112104580: 4, 111917976: 4, 112823201: 4, 111789786: 4, 110999688: 4, 111929003: 4, 107469778: 4, 112091216: 4, 110985244: 4, 109451199: 4, 200169513: 4, 108701917: 4, 200242352: 4, 109212068: 4, 200034945: 4, 200146694: 4, 109005921: 4, 111921737: 4, 112480961: 4, 110452119: 4, 200208380: 4, 112373727: 4, 10270: 4, 200810232: 4, 200855703: 4, 200845278: 4, 200120733: 4, 200463147: 4, 200355362: 4, 200386343: 4, 109994139: 4, 109057647: 4, 200155809: 4, 111380201: 4, 200891725: 4, 106863637: 4, 200273342: 4, 105961696: 3, 10168: 3, 106394111: 3, 106999733: 3, 105795015: 3, 107618553: 3, 105886426: 3, 105832216: 3, 105927660: 3, 105829522: 3, 106441937: 3, 106325770: 3, 105846944: 3, 105988971: 3, 107658399: 3, 105859992: 3, 10610: 3, 106089213: 3, 106117267: 3, 106120622: 3, 106205646: 3, 105811146: 3, 105801876: 3, 106437145: 3, 106342472: 3, 105899248: 3, 106778424: 3, 105828100: 3, 106953954: 3, 13658: 3, 106407009: 3, 106125724: 3, 106897206: 3, 106579529: 3, 108061618: 3, 106637423: 3, 107238223: 3, 108087249: 3, 106785304: 3, 107254662: 3, 108187975: 3, 106897359: 3, 106449525: 3, 108032974: 3, 108099571: 3, 108985107: 3, 106687445: 3, 107771322: 3, 106712274: 3, 107773063: 3, 110494556: 3, 107776832: 3, 109585728: 3, 107768989: 3, 107928271: 3, 109193524: 3, 107755397: 3, 110998345: 3, 111350357: 3, 110396163: 3, 111841723: 3, 112037097: 3, 110164339: 3, 108478944: 3, 110471998: 3, 109328345: 3, 110631955: 3, 108899032: 3, 110409351: 3, 111777299: 3, 112077859: 3, 111969139: 3, 106858324: 3, 111850994: 3, 109373249: 3, 108793472: 3, 112207296: 3, 107119236: 3, 109692317: 3, 107178254: 3, 200177277: 3, 111857489: 3, 13364: 3, 108103821: 3, 112846385: 3, 110758970: 3, 200472689: 3, 111878504: 3, 112192174: 3, 108152222: 3, 112423730: 3, 106173169: 3, 111849990: 3, 107007527: 3, 112042073: 3, 110548079: 3, 200222402: 3, 107400819: 2, 106098470: 2, 106394053: 2, 108240062: 2, 107678965: 2, 110570814: 2, 111169936: 2, 108857846: 2, 107691094: 2, 200132932: 2, 106679659: 2, 109316126: 2}"

Rap from a fixed anchor above, or use the Birdland bolt anchor directly to the right; or finish on P2 of Birdland.","{106394111: 4, 106022427: 4, 107246852: 4, 106785304: 4, 107699621: 4, 12448: 4, 105871367: 4, 105859992: 4, 107771322: 4, 105988971: 4, 106071787: 4, 107671020: 4, 106127989: 4, 106041457: 4, 106204631: 4, 106089213: 4, 10150: 4, 105892598: 4, 106054402: 4, 106151063: 4, 106246445: 4, 106297607: 4, 105851541: 4, 106953954: 4, 107002071: 4, 107178254: 4, 105891309: 4, 107226876: 4, 106687445: 4, 107548455: 4, 106993942: 4, 106486112: 4, 106736701: 4, 109143868: 4, 108082584: 4, 108032974: 4, 109816235: 4, 108843325: 4, 106238291: 4, 107185927: 4, 107311020: 4, 107194267: 4, 105890911: 4, 112037097: 4, 108478944: 4, 108363423: 4, 107574666: 4, 110164339: 4, 107932282: 4, 107007527: 4, 110391323: 4, 110619029: 4, 110148121: 4, 111777299: 4, 107469778: 4, 109018466: 4, 110315255: 4, 109187861: 4, 109092361: 4, 108793472: 4, 110999688: 4, 110409351: 4, 200108528: 4, 110764470: 4, 112042073: 4, 112091216: 4, 111047210: 4, 200067404: 4, 112134112: 4, 110494556: 4, 200337119: 4, 112846385: 4, 112823201: 4, 112192174: 4, 110578742: 4, 200394444: 4, 109193524: 4, 10270: 4, 110970484: 4, 112783536: 4, 106741264: 4, 110548079: 4, 108160061: 4, 107529159: 4, 200253280: 4, 107142289: 4, 106189019: 4, 112142591: 4, 200120733: 4, 111662106: 4, 10168: 3, 106325770: 3, 10610: 3, 107240862: 3, 106897206: 3, 105990845: 3, 106344939: 3, 105899248: 3, 106058125: 3, 106942628: 3, 105828100: 3, 106637976: 3, 106607660: 3, 106405973: 3, 106579529: 3, 107767801: 3, 106102123: 3, 106125724: 3, 107324126: 3, 107696530: 3, 106449525: 3, 109767025: 3, 107790918: 3, 107400819: 3, 107434457: 3, 107755397: 3, 110396163: 3, 107536174: 3, 111016597: 3, 109328345: 3, 112097145: 3, 111053951: 3, 111829790: 3, 108463947: 3, 107633879: 3, 111841723: 3, 11690: 3, 109884427: 3, 106879280: 3, 105798365: 3, 200123489: 3, 106209804: 3, 106210225: 3, 108751329: 3, 106571266: 3, 110739544: 3, 111850994: 3, 200498039: 3, 111857489: 2}"

Step left and work your way up an awkward vertical slot. Then mantel onto a sloping ledge, crossing the route Up Yours. (People used to belay here in days of yore but it is best to continue.) Step up to an obvious thin vertical crack that arches up and left. Be mindful of the ledge as you commit to engage with this crack; I like to reach way up and place a nut over my head before I get going. Once you get onto the face, continue up the crack, with thin moves and good gear placed from tenuous stances, and then follow the crack to the left, reaching a jug beneath another overhang. From here, move to the right as you surmount the overhang, finally ending on a good ledge with a tree that has cord and rap rings attached. Whew, what a pitch!  Ivan Rezucha: The original P2 went up an obvious 5.8 jagged crack that had been done earlier as a variation of a nearby route. That 5.8 crack was one of the ""cleavages"" that led to the name Elder Cleavage.  Pitch 2 as it is usually done today (and as described in guidebook), 5.4: From the tree at the end of pitch one, move up and a little bit right, through an overhang. Then follow the path of least resistance past several more ledges with trees, some of them with fixed gear on them, until you reach the large ledge. The climbing is all 5.4 with occasional loose crap and dirty horizontals. It is pretty much straight up with some slight jogs to the left and right. Avoid the thickest fields of lichen and you'll stay on track. This pitch is worth doing just to get to the third pitch. Once you reach the big ledge, move to the right about 15 feet to a good-sized tree that is just to the left of a pile of blocks that is leaning against the wall of the cliff.  Pitch 3, 5.10b: This is one of the best 5.10 roofs in the Gunks! Start up the right-facing corner above the stacked blocks. Climb easily up to a stance beneath the large roof with a hanging, left-facing corner just to the right. Make the committing moves up and into the roof; there is good gear to be had next to some blown-out old fixed nuts.

The route goes almost straight up. The roof pitch is fun and exciting but the other dirty climbing is a heavy price to pay. The climbing up to the not-so-GT ledge would actually be pretty nice without all the lichen.  Climb vegetated rock straight up past a dead tree wedged between two other trees (hard not to use it.) Wander up a slab to a slippery ledge, step right, climb the face and nose in orange-white rock to some small C3 placements below an overhang. Pull the overhang and then move basically straight up for 12’~ to a stance (5.10- PG/R.)  Continue up the lichen-covered face above, almost straight up and a tad bit right, shooting for successive pine trees. Along the way you will encounter: some small overlaps, a few loose blocks, generally solid rock, and maybe a couple of 5.7 moves. Arrive at the not-so-GT Ledge and belay at the obvious pine. If you combine this pitch with the first (recommended) it’s about a 200’ pitch.  Next pitch: Step a bit left of the tree and climb a face with overlaps toward the obvious protruding block and short right-facing corner above and to the left. Work up into the alcove/corner (#5 Camalot helpful, other gear available) and then climb out to another horizontal that is dirtier and takes less gear. Fire out past the lip to a bomber jug that eats a #3 and presumably a #2. Make a standard 5.10a pull-up and mantle move and you’re done. Except...  Climb up more dirty rock and grassy/thorny ledges to some gear placements and a vague grassy ledge. Several exits are possible but we moved 20’ right and belayed.

More delicate climbing takes you up to the end of the Roseland traverse.,"{109018466: 3, 106344939: 2, 200337119: 2, 107246852: 1}"

P2 - First go up and right ~10 feet, then back left about 10 feet (tricky moves, perhaps more like Gunks 5.4) to reach a longer, steeper left-facing corner. Follow that to its top, up the face above and eventually over a bulge to a wide ledge. On its right side is a large pine tree with rappel slings. This is a long pitch, ~120'.

P4 - Go up the inside of the open book for ~20 ft (some trickiness) to underneath the highest overhang above. Move up and right to old pitons. Traverse 30-40 ft right horizontally under the roof (exposed but good holds, possibly some old pitons). After the roof ends, head up past bulges and slabs to the trees (100', 5.4).  You'll want to extend your belay back to the cliff edge.

The prospect of a fall while committing to this move is horrifying:  your only reliable pro is well below your feet on the pillar.  The problem I had with the move was that, at full extension, on my tiptoes, I could just barely touch the lip of the roof -- and as it was, I had to ""fall into it"" -- only to find that the jug was still an inch or two out of reach!

Once you're past the roof, head right to a set of chains.","{105795015: 4, 105990845: 4, 107730254: 4, 105904878: 4, 105961696: 4, 106054402: 4, 10996: 4, 107743165: 4, 107771322: 4, 107493811: 4, 106030894: 4, 107748535: 4, 107621295: 4, 107561935: 4, 107663290: 4, 106041457: 4, 107792493: 4, 107902567: 4, 106242548: 4, 105898385: 4, 105899248: 4, 106411080: 4, 106493776: 4, 106108233: 4, 105811146: 4, 106619418: 4, 107226876: 4, 106619581: 4, 106751248: 4, 106773591: 4, 106405973: 4, 106001645: 4, 106418097: 4, 106855118: 4, 105851541: 4, 106306400: 4, 106737343: 4, 106095805: 4, 108096611: 4, 108082584: 4, 106933730: 4, 106928886: 4, 107304112: 4, 108205352: 4, 107185927: 4, 107678965: 4, 106360234: 4, 108020482: 4, 108329997: 4, 107803888: 4, 107625137: 4, 106238291: 4, 108202763: 4, 108857846: 4, 106736701: 4, 108159370: 4, 108843325: 4, 107100666: 4, 105911703: 4, 109094525: 4, 109402402: 4, 108053294: 4, 106280741: 4, 108000881: 4, 107417154: 4, 107093945: 4, 107620610: 4, 110347822: 4, 108805745: 4, 109193524: 4, 106549589: 4, 108495695: 4, 110619029: 4, 107801617: 4, 107723931: 4, 107929356: 4, 109411206: 4, 108256477: 4, 110211008: 4, 110190703: 4, 110315426: 4, 109659244: 4, 109143868: 4, 108324210: 4, 111884209: 4, 107297910: 4, 111500558: 4, 12084: 4, 108266938: 4, 107691094: 4, 109581184: 4, 107858105: 4, 110462006: 4, 110148121: 4, 107544688: 4, 111854190: 4, 110811023: 4, 110164339: 4, 111565043: 4, 108985245: 4, 110942763: 4, 200177287: 4, 111371412: 4, 108181003: 4, 109187861: 4, 108103821: 4, 111850994: 4, 111796230: 4, 108793472: 4, 110409351: 4, 200294860: 4, 108312382: 4, 106326845: 4, 200148833: 4, 107186883: 4, 111696155: 4, 107629487: 4, 106398706: 4, 200067404: 4, 107417501: 4, 200079158: 4, 109300359: 4, 111380201: 4, 112042073: 4, 106897359: 4, 200088269: 4, 200171784: 4, 112373727: 4, 105891309: 4, 200145352: 4, 200242352: 4, 200158745: 4, 200350797: 4, 200150625: 4, 107002528: 4, 110062671: 4, 110315255: 4, 106999733: 3, 107475857: 3, 105788804: 3, 106785304: 3, 12448: 3, 106325770: 3, 106299993: 3, 107400819: 3, 106571266: 3, 10220: 3, 106089213: 3, 107548455: 3, 107159816: 3, 106071787: 3, 107257835: 3, 106297607: 3, 106020371: 3, 105946742: 3, 106290147: 3, 106197143: 3, 105801876: 3, 106011891: 3, 106407009: 3, 105892598: 3, 106461208: 3, 106423391: 3, 106762873: 3, 11690: 3, 106637976: 3, 106953954: 3, 106985791: 3, 106344939: 3, 105899901: 3, 107238223: 3, 107246852: 3, 106441937: 3, 106022427: 3, 107519230: 3, 107178254: 3, 106748471: 3, 108139891: 3, 107262260: 3, 10168: 3, 108104464: 3, 106102123: 3, 107119375: 3, 108367150: 3, 107658399: 3, 105889415: 3, 107787623: 3, 108312115: 3, 106666369: 3, 108363423: 3, 107768989: 3, 107248365: 3, 109289720: 3, 106741264: 3, 106486112: 3, 109359027: 3, 107644182: 3, 108759814: 3, 108867086: 3, 107696530: 3, 106075659: 3, 106993942: 3, 108608330: 3, 107674835: 3, 106879280: 3, 109136692: 3, 107746328: 3, 108187975: 3, 108529353: 3, 109142435: 3, 108032974: 3, 108401191: 3, 109711410: 3, 109005921: 3, 107194267: 3, 106542092: 3, 108307042: 3, 107146835: 3, 106822110: 3, 110320894: 3, 106342472: 3, 105798365: 3, 10520: 3, 107240862: 3, 110746025: 3, 111955057: 3, 108014034: 3, 108320578: 3, 108478944: 3, 112097145: 3, 106210225: 3, 108047997: 3, 112124162: 3, 108181716: 3, 111829790: 3, 107830036: 3, 111795422: 3, 109451199: 3, 109018466: 3, 107412430: 3, 112474279: 3, 107032446: 3, 109466226: 3, 111666789: 3, 108742211: 3, 110270698: 3, 112352056: 3, 111968804: 3, 107059069: 3, 112314245: 3, 112140841: 3, 200146852: 3, 108104429: 3, 110185189: 3, 110999688: 3, 106494505: 3, 111777299: 3, 107783937: 3, 107931921: 3, 200252657: 3, 112207296: 3, 200298904: 3, 200195571: 3, 106209804: 3, 112460885: 3, 111857489: 3, 109092361: 3, 111917976: 3, 112091216: 3, 107469778: 3, 111878504: 3, 108028939: 3, 200174493: 3, 200433817: 3, 106646308: 3, 107928271: 3, 112059164: 3, 111969490: 3, 106526829: 3, 111974624: 3, 112924258: 3, 112134112: 3, 200333846: 3, 200034945: 3, 110787766: 3, 200288455: 3, 111983907: 3, 107373153: 3, 112050276: 3, 106449525: 3, 106870707: 3, 200489777: 3, 10270: 3, 200594684: 3, 200120733: 3, 107545559: 3, 111741206: 3, 112104580: 3, 107314708: 3, 107206725: 3, 111662106: 3, 111315718: 3, 200671914: 3, 105832216: 2, 106139012: 2, 106394111: 2, 107767801: 2, 108031241: 2, 107217151: 2, 108136088: 2, 106125724: 2, 105798761: 2, 107646553: 2, 107142289: 2, 109767025: 2, 110877362: 2, 106897206: 2, 110998345: 2, 109102869: 2, 106347425: 2, 111744118: 2, 111841723: 2, 107718501: 2, 109884427: 2, 107569651: 2, 200187164: 2, 108980384: 2, 200112890: 2, 200492491: 2, 110830564: 2, 110689679: 2, 106643379: 1, 106607660: 1}"

The Brat,106395360,Trad,107037539,5.7,55,1,2.1,72.0,"The Brat Direct is an exciting climb that will demand your attention. Among a few routes at the entrance of The Trapps, this gem stays well lit late into the day. Begin at the base of a large, broken, and obvious crack. Awkward climbing up and past a pin will keep your eyes wide open. Take a good rest, protect your next sequence of moves, and head up and right to a hidden blast hole. From this uneasy stance move over some lower angled rock to a small ledge. Get your balance and traverse left past another pin and top out on a large ledge before the hovering, yet solid boulder.  You can bypass the harder crux when the crack narrows by going right onto the easier face, at the cost of less protection.","{109921986: 4, 106344939: 3, 106407009: 3, 200352097: 3, 107493811: 3, 107093945: 3, 108195022: 3, 108741916: 3, 107400911: 3, 109250801: 3, 110866897: 3, 106971070: 3, 107902567: 3, 200183967: 3, 112073495: 3, 200602495: 3, 106299993: 3, 10270: 2, 108300756: 2, 108478944: 2, 109193524: 2, 200267314: 2, 105890911: 2, 108321835: 2, 200062780: 2, 107691094: 2, 112449870: 2, 111308179: 2, 200067404: 2, 106846955: 2, 108310475: 2, 200383658: 2, 107783937: 2, 108375637: 2, 200489777: 2, 108793472: 2, 108696498: 2, 105828100: 2, 105851541: 2, 107238223: 2, 107178254: 2, 107262260: 2, 105816899: 2, 106347425: 2, 107561935: 2, 106301735: 2, 107901742: 2, 106297607: 2, 106087077: 2, 107671020: 2, 107563431: 2, 107185927: 2, 107518458: 2, 107116332: 2, 108652563: 2, 106726952: 2, 108988764: 2, 108125264: 2, 109074558: 2, 107228100: 2, 109451199: 2, 107400819: 1, 106571266: 1, 106290147: 1, 200261852: 1, 108395065: 1, 106762873: 1, 106774740: 1, 108106981: 1, 13658: 1, 107929356: 1, 107553094: 1}"

He would have succeeded in pulling me up, as he often did, except for the fact that the rope ran through the 3 inch slot at the edge of the roof.

This past weekend, my partner and I found out why.    P1: Climb an obvious 4"" left-leaning crack onto the ledge, follow the chimney/corner to the overhang and exit right. The crux is mid-crack at the chockstone. Grab the chockstone and chicken-wing your way up to good holds.  Grey Dick rates it at 5.7 - it's probably a 5.7 for someone over 6', for they could grab the grimper on the right easily, for anyone shorter, the OW feels at least a 5.9. Hence there is the ambiguous 5.7+ grade.  If anyone more experienced in OW, can enlighten me what grade this should go as an off-width, I'd be happy to change the grade.   Wear old jeans/carhartts that you won't regret cutting off in case your knee gets stuck.    Variations:   There are two hand and finger cracks to the left of the OW, they supposedly go at 5.9 and 5.9+. These two cracks are also very popular bouldering problems.

Rap with a single rope.","{106778424: 4, 106719962: 4, 10185: 4, 105873502: 4, 14015: 4, 107174265: 4, 105823713: 4, 106405973: 4, 105904878: 4, 105859992: 4, 107240862: 4, 107771322: 4, 106299993: 4, 106246445: 4, 107400819: 4, 105878863: 4, 106089213: 4, 106071787: 4, 107663290: 4, 106041457: 4, 106297607: 4, 107835722: 4, 106207412: 4, 107026497: 4, 106139012: 4, 105898385: 4, 106411080: 4, 105961696: 4, 106407009: 4, 105892598: 4, 105851541: 4, 106087077: 4, 106423391: 4, 106151063: 4, 106619581: 4, 106202599: 4, 106762873: 4, 106637976: 4, 106607660: 4, 106418097: 4, 106555971: 4, 106985791: 4, 107246852: 4, 106953954: 4, 106095805: 4, 107767801: 4, 107089682: 4, 107629487: 4, 106720416: 4, 107226876: 4, 106993942: 4, 107142289: 4, 108444659: 4, 106238291: 4, 107100666: 4, 106486112: 4, 106736701: 4, 108202763: 4, 106549589: 4, 108082584: 4, 108152408: 4, 107768989: 4, 108401191: 4, 107852661: 4, 107238223: 4, 108364313: 4, 107620610: 4, 108363423: 4, 107929356: 4, 108843325: 4, 108188613: 4, 109005921: 4, 107185927: 4, 107633879: 4, 109816235: 4, 110954097: 4, 108367150: 4, 108529353: 4, 110619029: 4, 107801617: 4, 109018466: 4, 108981414: 4, 108014034: 4, 108181716: 4, 108320578: 4, 110946269: 4, 108478944: 4, 106398706: 4, 111955057: 4, 110148121: 4, 109466226: 4, 200079158: 4, 110117203: 4, 110315255: 4, 113522523: 4, 107469778: 4, 110689679: 4, 109187861: 4, 105798365: 4, 111777299: 4, 110942763: 4, 200041839: 4, 108103821: 4, 111850994: 4, 111796230: 4, 108793472: 4, 107544688: 4, 107119375: 4, 106209804: 4, 106326845: 4, 111857489: 4, 112460885: 4, 110162234: 4, 200158745: 4, 108252197: 4, 107186883: 4, 112091216: 4, 200267314: 4, 111999314: 4, 112059164: 4, 200067404: 4, 200146694: 4, 107417501: 4, 111308179: 4, 109092361: 4, 110062671: 4, 107799914: 4, 109193524: 4, 10270: 4, 108939459: 4, 200120733: 4, 111741206: 4, 112086258: 4, 108031666: 4, 200399381: 4, 200674824: 4, 107533935: 4, 200150625: 4, 200634307: 4, 111662106: 4, 106748471: 3, 106360234: 3, 10202: 3, 12448: 3, 105788804: 3, 107429065: 3, 106030894: 3, 105990845: 3, 106125724: 3, 105896714: 3, 107699621: 3, 107199645: 3, 106325770: 3, 106717383: 3, 106020445: 3, 10610: 3, 11278: 3, 107551540: 3, 107671020: 3, 105889270: 3, 106567971: 3, 105946742: 3, 14537: 3, 106197143: 3, 106290147: 3, 106344939: 3, 105886426: 3, 105899248: 3, 14595: 3, 106058125: 3, 106054402: 3, 11690: 3, 106942628: 3, 105828100: 3, 106687445: 3, 106999733: 3, 106971875: 3, 105899901: 3, 105906559: 3, 107002071: 3, 106571266: 3, 106394111: 3, 107475857: 3, 107178254: 3, 106441937: 3, 107093945: 3, 106579529: 3, 107696530: 3, 107304112: 3, 108104464: 3, 106102123: 3, 106001645: 3, 108666790: 3, 106146571: 3, 106411326: 3, 106901183: 3, 109152722: 3, 107638654: 3, 108104429: 3, 109136692: 3, 107561935: 3, 108032974: 3, 106280741: 3, 109767025: 3, 106158148: 3, 107803888: 3, 108805745: 3, 106430658: 3, 109711410: 3, 110524225: 3, 107194267: 3, 106897206: 3, 109146884: 3, 107755397: 3, 107691094: 3, 12084: 3, 112097145: 3, 107858105: 3, 107297910: 3, 111983604: 3, 108363902: 3, 106347425: 3, 107169450: 3, 200041551: 3, 110729900: 3, 112042073: 3, 106494505: 3, 200174493: 3, 111822624: 3, 200303045: 3, 110270698: 3, 111969490: 3, 110133075: 3, 106646308: 3, 108091988: 3, 113168176: 3, 106679659: 3, 112050276: 3, 107886100: 3, 111878504: 3, 107002528: 3, 200329363: 3, 200207146: 3, 109411750: 3, 109414386: 3, 108980384: 3, 109869056: 3, 107373153: 3, 105832216: 3, 200168968: 3, 107529159: 3, 110830564: 3, 200169513: 3, 109638995: 3, 200350797: 3, 111546553: 3, 106189019: 3, 107206725: 3, 107483048: 2, 10168: 2, 107493811: 2, 107273411: 2, 107427822: 2, 107519230: 2, 110423556: 2, 111977319: 2, 111841723: 2, 109884427: 2, 112102872: 2, 110839245: 2, 112192174: 2, 106449525: 1}"

Rap with one rope.","{12448: 4, 105990845: 4, 107525760: 4, 107093945: 4, 106041457: 4, 106567971: 4, 106411080: 4, 106407009: 4, 106555971: 4, 106749092: 4, 106953888: 4, 108082584: 4, 106993942: 4, 107185927: 4, 106238291: 4, 106741264: 4, 107100666: 4, 107780250: 4, 108401191: 4, 107852661: 4, 108363423: 4, 107768989: 4, 109816235: 4, 107030540: 4, 107872722: 4, 107755397: 4, 111598397: 4, 110948108: 4, 110190703: 4, 106022427: 4, 108014034: 4, 108181716: 4, 106398706: 4, 111955057: 4, 110148121: 4, 109990981: 4, 200079158: 4, 105798365: 4, 111777299: 4, 200293863: 4, 112140841: 4, 200067404: 4, 109005921: 4, 200146694: 4, 110062671: 4, 108310475: 4, 106897359: 4, 112086258: 4, 111696155: 4, 107483048: 3, 107429065: 3, 107551540: 3, 107475857: 3, 10185: 3, 10232: 3, 10202: 3, 106999733: 3, 105795015: 3, 105824694: 3, 106726952: 3, 105873502: 3, 105828714: 3, 14015: 3, 106125724: 3, 105896714: 3, 105832216: 3, 105904878: 3, 107199645: 3, 107771322: 3, 106020445: 3, 106246445: 3, 107400819: 3, 105899901: 3, 105813053: 3, 106214584: 3, 106089213: 3, 10610: 3, 11278: 3, 106071787: 3, 107671020: 3, 107663290: 3, 105889270: 3, 107835722: 3, 105961696: 3, 106207412: 3, 106139012: 3, 105946742: 3, 105898385: 3, 106151063: 3, 105892598: 3, 106290147: 3, 106121271: 3, 105811146: 3, 106423391: 3, 105899248: 3, 106619581: 3, 106762873: 3, 14595: 3, 106054402: 3, 11690: 3, 106778424: 3, 106719962: 3, 106942628: 3, 105828100: 3, 106687445: 3, 105851541: 3, 106087077: 3, 106953954: 3, 106971875: 3, 106347425: 3, 106985791: 3, 106344939: 3, 107246852: 3, 106342472: 3, 107248365: 3, 14537: 3, 106394111: 3, 107743165: 3, 107178254: 3, 106579529: 3, 107696530: 3, 107159816: 3, 107304112: 3, 107089682: 3, 107142289: 3, 107629487: 3, 106102123: 3, 106897206: 3, 106720416: 3, 106095805: 3, 108367150: 3, 105891309: 3, 107902567: 3, 108666790: 3, 106146571: 3, 106486112: 3, 106411326: 3, 108363902: 3, 108202763: 3, 109037301: 3, 106405973: 3, 106981854: 3, 108152408: 3, 107238223: 3, 107119375: 3, 107638654: 3, 107427822: 3, 107827568: 3, 105859360: 3, 107553094: 3, 106280741: 3, 106586268: 3, 107194267: 3, 108364313: 3, 106158148: 3, 106740823: 3, 106325770: 3, 108529353: 3, 110423556: 3, 108843325: 3, 108805745: 3, 110524225: 3, 110877362: 3, 110683495: 3, 110619029: 3, 107928271: 3, 107434457: 3, 107929356: 3, 108981414: 3, 108633199: 3, 107691094: 3, 107620691: 3, 110746025: 3, 111016597: 3, 109465165: 3, 108320578: 3, 108478944: 3, 12084: 3, 112097145: 3, 107356939: 3, 107858105: 3, 109328345: 3, 111983604: 3, 111281190: 3, 106646308: 3, 106210225: 3, 109018466: 3, 108231358: 3, 112463509: 3, 110735180: 3, 108329997: 3, 111781359: 3, 200041551: 3, 107059069: 3, 110315255: 3, 113522523: 3, 110729900: 3, 112102872: 3, 110689679: 3, 108103821: 3, 111371412: 3, 108047997: 3, 109187861: 3, 106494505: 3, 110942763: 3, 112042073: 3, 108032974: 3, 200041839: 3, 108793472: 3, 107544688: 3, 111850994: 3, 111822624: 3, 200303045: 3, 107469778: 3, 106209804: 3, 107226876: 3, 108751329: 3, 112460885: 3, 110162234: 3, 200158745: 3, 111969490: 3, 107186883: 3, 110133075: 3, 111878504: 3, 113168176: 3, 107886100: 3, 200234516: 3, 107002528: 3, 107617264: 3, 111308179: 3, 111674806: 3, 107799914: 3, 108361107: 3, 109414386: 3, 108980384: 3, 200034945: 3, 200168968: 3, 200169513: 3, 10270: 3, 200120733: 3, 108939459: 3, 200605485: 3, 112104580: 3, 200399381: 3, 111829790: 3, 106189019: 3, 107206725: 3, 200150625: 3, 107783937: 3, 200634307: 3, 111662106: 3, 106360234: 2, 106403737: 2, 10168: 2, 107174265: 2, 107493811: 2, 107240862: 2, 105878863: 2, 106224522: 2, 106388951: 2, 105886426: 2, 106202599: 2, 106058125: 2, 106794436: 2, 106607660: 2, 105906559: 2, 106571266: 2, 106441937: 2, 107767801: 2, 107273411: 2, 106001645: 2, 107688970: 2, 106736701: 2, 109152722: 2, 109136692: 2, 107746328: 2, 106666369: 2, 108104429: 2, 107646553: 2, 111815674: 2, 107169450: 2, 112091216: 2, 107931921: 2, 111857489: 2, 110270698: 2, 111999314: 2, 112050276: 2, 200207146: 2, 110839245: 2, 111071238: 2, 200492491: 2, 107529159: 2, 112192174: 2, 107533935: 2, 110830564: 2, 106449525: 1}"

Pitch 2: At the wall behind your tree anchor, you'll see a broken corner. Currently there's a tree which gets in your face as you climb this. Go up the corner about 20 feet until you meet a ledge. Walk/crawl left about 10 feet until the ledge meets a corner. Turn (climber's) left around the corner, look up and right - you'll see a fairly clean, white ramp. Follow the ramp up. From here it looks like you could easily go up left to top out.

The moves (and the gear) is all there, but both can be tricky.  The climbing eases back to 5.6 after the opening moves. The crack climbing is supplemented by many face holds as well. Enjoy the incredible fist-jam move just before the finish.  Bolted anchor at the top.  Robert Hall suggests that you can continue for another pitch (see picture): From the top of P1 of Laurel, step a foot or so right and climb directly up the face on a thin crack, over a small overhang and on to the top.  I don't know if this ever made it into a guidebook, but it was in no guidebook when I ""discovered"" this fine ending that keeps the grade (of the pre-polished) Laurel in the late 60's - early 70's.  Gear is maybe some small nuts for the lower portion, then small-to-med. stuff, if my memory serves me.

Climb easily up to a roof that is approximately 15 to 20 feet above the ground via a good crack and some face climbing and/or stemming.  Jam a really nice hand-and-fist crack through the roof, up into a flare/squeeze sort of affair. Get situated and pull over another roof via finger jamming and face climbing.

This can be backed up with several small cams directly adjacent, and more in the horizontals just below if you wanted.  A couple of tough moves off crimps up the shallow left-facing corner follow, and if you lead this (we didn't) your gear will be at or below your feet when you latch the good holds.  Easier (8ish?) climbing follows above that, and then you can either step right around the corner or follow the left-hand edge of the block.  Maybe the center of the block was the original route, but there's a lot of lichen there now.  The upper section seems like it might not have the best pro.

Descend via rappel, Radcliffe, or the Uberfall Descent.","{107228100: 4, 105854232: 4, 106619581: 4, 110735180: 4, 108159370: 4, 108849186: 4, 111955057: 4, 109701612: 4, 112423730: 4, 108329997: 4, 111688302: 4, 200123489: 4, 106018883: 4, 200108528: 4, 200463296: 4, 200294652: 4, 200214004: 4, 200804484: 4, 106928959: 3, 107493811: 3, 107278005: 3, 107516555: 3, 107134320: 3, 106932935: 3, 107559594: 3, 107748535: 3, 107919874: 3, 106290147: 3, 106054402: 3, 105898385: 3, 106306579: 3, 106666668: 3, 106697383: 3, 106715003: 3, 106732573: 3, 106591608: 3, 106344939: 3, 107068335: 3, 106985791: 3, 106993942: 3, 106737343: 3, 107723931: 3, 106125724: 3, 108187975: 3, 107304112: 3, 107142289: 3, 108189638: 3, 105886625: 3, 106493776: 3, 108394904: 3, 108857846: 3, 107561935: 3, 109037301: 3, 108985107: 3, 107833965: 3, 107417154: 3, 107246852: 3, 110359430: 3, 108181003: 3, 108524622: 3, 108228481: 3, 109586477: 3, 108157281: 3, 109451199: 3, 108110667: 3, 110270698: 3, 106560803: 3, 110728444: 3, 110036457: 3, 110494556: 3, 110628071: 3, 111842420: 3, 108305825: 3, 110998345: 3, 111169936: 3, 107852661: 3, 107545559: 3, 110870686: 3, 112161233: 3, 111811598: 3, 111511849: 3, 111692742: 3, 108100269: 3, 200069906: 3, 112463509: 3, 200076100: 3, 110340063: 3, 111902978: 3, 111999314: 3, 109597474: 3, 111850994: 3, 112101044: 3, 106858324: 3, 200134202: 3, 107569651: 3, 112520586: 3, 110336734: 3, 113122296: 3, 112091216: 3, 112136403: 3, 110735872: 3, 111546553: 3, 112449870: 3, 109393254: 3, 111656243: 3, 111822624: 3, 108225547: 3, 112799721: 3, 112302016: 3, 111931623: 3, 200196459: 3, 111460596: 3, 200253280: 3, 112924258: 3, 112086258: 3, 200067404: 3, 111878504: 3, 111849990: 3, 108443840: 3, 200489777: 3, 200299483: 3, 108690445: 3, 200168968: 3, 110985244: 3, 110619029: 3, 200593892: 3, 200297969: 3, 200469253: 3, 106398706: 3, 200463147: 3, 200929612: 3, 200907207: 3, 107518458: 2, 107483048: 2, 107525760: 2, 107619437: 2, 107560092: 2, 107664805: 2, 106325770: 2, 107629487: 2, 106680875: 2, 107372532: 2, 106299993: 2, 107746328: 2, 106098470: 2, 107093945: 2, 105949578: 2, 107902567: 2, 106204631: 2, 106207412: 2, 106020371: 2, 106103271: 2, 106097690: 2, 106108233: 2, 106407009: 2, 106087077: 2, 106751248: 2, 106301735: 2, 106817494: 2, 106567319: 2, 106855118: 2, 106852549: 2, 106822110: 2, 106719962: 2, 106554048: 2, 106803582: 2, 106797746: 2, 107253738: 2, 107262260: 2, 106580951: 2, 106897206: 2, 106853948: 2, 108169776: 2, 106963929: 2, 107671020: 2, 107051650: 2, 106871882: 2, 107625137: 2, 107254662: 2, 108268126: 2, 108298258: 2, 106347425: 2, 108307042: 2, 108291738: 2, 106360234: 2, 106945872: 2, 109856888: 2, 108324210: 2, 107499312: 2, 108401191: 2, 106238291: 2, 108711756: 2, 108857424: 2, 106971070: 2, 108363423: 2, 108428307: 2, 108173104: 2, 107768989: 2, 107238223: 2, 107914961: 2, 107830036: 2, 108587636: 2, 109405478: 2, 108507566: 2, 109597965: 2, 109608840: 2, 108985245: 2, 108988764: 2, 107185927: 2, 108843325: 2, 109142435: 2, 109635835: 2, 109193524: 2, 110409351: 2, 106372764: 2, 108652563: 2, 110536657: 2, 106297607: 2, 109280064: 2, 107536174: 2, 110148121: 2, 108367150: 2, 108590756: 2, 109411206: 2, 108981414: 2, 106022427: 2, 109079758: 2, 109907430: 2, 110532423: 2, 109659244: 2, 111917126: 2, 111921579: 2, 107068306: 2, 111882861: 2, 112037097: 2, 112039304: 2, 110253489: 2, 107100666: 2, 109581184: 2, 105851541: 2, 111351508: 2, 109737113: 2, 111945819: 2, 110631955: 2, 112282512: 2, 106394111: 2, 112166651: 2, 106646308: 2, 111952375: 2, 112946306: 2, 108772391: 2, 112546186: 2, 106917454: 2, 111777299: 2, 112134112: 2, 110737852: 2, 200148833: 2, 200074424: 2, 107783937: 2, 108375637: 2, 200299671: 2, 200134718: 2, 106778424: 2, 200143675: 2, 109692317: 2, 112042073: 2, 111857489: 2, 200174864: 2, 200194507: 2, 111810534: 2, 112846385: 2, 109018466: 2, 112104580: 2, 200363508: 2, 200433817: 2, 107318184: 2, 108793472: 2, 105886426: 2, 110712867: 2, 200034945: 2, 108310475: 2, 106571266: 2, 112373727: 2, 105832216: 2, 200312793: 2, 112073495: 2, 200371228: 2, 200396867: 2, 200150625: 2, 200936538: 2, 200327054: 2, 106999733: 1, 107592563: 1, 107400819: 1, 107438587: 1, 106405973: 1, 105801876: 1, 106089213: 1, 107552617: 1, 106117267: 1, 106062921: 1, 106071787: 1, 105842979: 1, 105889415: 1, 106773591: 1, 106841465: 1, 106907802: 1, 107183263: 1, 107464151: 1, 107682885: 1, 107735256: 1, 109437284: 1, 107194267: 1, 106430658: 0, 107866982: 0, 106617556: 0, 110866897: 0}"
Betty,105920873,Trad,107037580,5.3,150,2,2.8,368.0,"This is an old route with some historic significance. Dick Williams notes that this was the first route in the Gunks with a female FA.  The first pitch is straightforward. Go up the wide crack (face holds abound), and through the mellow overhang to stand on the spacious belay ledge with a bolted anchor.  The second pitch is less obvious, but it's tough to get into real trouble. Climb up a left-facing corner and chimney. From here, whether you stay right in the chimney systems, or traverse left onto the nose and face (fun!), the climbing is similar in difficulty and pro is reasonably available. The exposure on the nose variation is nice.  Descent: From the cliff top, rappel from the bolted anchor. If it's a busy day, you can also walk off via Radcliffe, or the Uberfall Descent.","{107228100: 4, 107449935: 4, 105880131: 4, 105833454: 4, 106087077: 4, 106666668: 4, 106797746: 4, 106869562: 4,

Not another living soul other than your partner will be visible once you're in the bowels of the chimney/cave on the second pitch.    P1 5.6: Up the chimney with no protection until you get about 30 ft up. At the top, swing  around the corner and up onto a ledge. Enter the cave and set an anchor.    P2 5.6: Go deeper into the cave until a finger crack appears. Chimney up beside the crack. At the top, start working your way back towards the opening of the chimney. Re-enter the light. From here, it is possible to move up and climber's left onto the face and belay from the top of the second pitch of Miss Bailey (V1). Or continue straight up above the chimney exit to a large ledge with a tree (V2).    P3 (V1) 5.6+: Finish on the last pitch of Miss Bailey.

This is a great route, often open, but it does share the P1 belay of Betty.  P1 - Climb the bulge, then go up to and follow a thin crack that diagonals left (crux) and up to a ledge and belay tree.  P2 - Move up to an overhang then diagonal right on the face past a right-facing flake/corner to another overhang and fixed pin. Move right some more and up a crack (crux) and face a bolted anchor (shared with Matinee).  P3 - Up right on easy ledges, then up the slightly runout face, aiming for the bolt (replaced in 2015; the book says 5.8 R for this section). Tricams and RPs can be used if you are old school and eschew the bolt. Pull the small overhang (crux), and up the face to the top.

Variation starts: there are several ways to access the upper part of the route while avoiding the crux start. It's possible to start on Jackie and traverse right above the tree. You can also start low on the face between Jackie and the crux start, and wander up a path of least resistance.

Descend via rappel if you can, Radcliffe, or the Uberfall Descent.","{107097681: 4, 11690: 4, 110359430: 4, 109405787: 4, 110494556: 4, 108849186: 4, 107852661: 4, 110082976: 4, 113026820: 4, 108329997: 4, 112423730: 4, 110062671: 4, 200108528: 4, 111849990: 4, 107253738: 4, 200294652: 4, 200243255: 4, 112512800: 4, 107629487: 4, 112192174: 4, 107217526: 3, 107278005: 3, 107464151: 3, 106874511: 3, 107228100: 3, 11926: 3, 107664805: 3, 105813053: 3, 106299993: 3, 107561935: 3, 107816448: 3, 105811146: 3, 106204631: 3, 107919874: 3, 106124374: 3, 106477370: 3, 106087077: 3, 105892598: 3, 106306579: 3, 106474214: 3, 106121271: 3, 106263368: 3, 106708236: 3, 105832216: 3, 106588964: 3, 106554048: 3, 106775372: 3, 106347425: 3, 106344939: 3, 106963929: 3, 106913581: 3, 107262260: 3, 106125724: 3, 108187975: 3, 107089682: 3, 107682885: 3, 108232226: 3, 108394904: 3, 106493776: 3, 107142289: 3, 106971070: 3, 107518458: 3, 109037301: 3, 107620691: 3, 108843325: 3, 107830036: 3, 108985245: 3, 109526275: 3, 110190703: 3, 107246852: 3, 109816235: 3, 108110425: 3, 109505100: 3, 110536657: 3, 107614408: 3, 107536174: 3, 107412430: 3, 108159370: 3, 108367150: 3, 109280064: 3, 107876007: 3, 109411206: 3, 106630260: 3, 110165451: 3, 109748591: 3, 108305825: 3, 108540048: 3, 107545559: 3, 111900615: 3, 110738873: 3, 106863637: 3, 110144057: 3, 110086015: 3, 108478944: 3, 111983604: 3, 109581184: 3, 111968804: 3, 110253489: 3, 109701612: 3, 111952375: 3, 111859070: 3, 111850994: 3, 109018466: 3, 111902978: 3, 109187861: 3, 109136692: 3, 112134112: 3, 109542989: 3, 109520222: 3, 7117171: 3, 112124162: 3, 106210225: 3, 200166602: 3, 108167130: 3, 112449870: 3, 108027731: 3, 110330190: 3, 200141580: 3, 200134718: 3, 107434457: 3, 200174864: 3, 107783937: 3, 111857489: 3, 106103271: 3, 200187164: 3, 111460596: 3, 111811598: 3, 200433817: 3, 200067404: 3, 108103821: 3, 105885105: 3, 200299483: 3, 108690445: 3, 200396867: 3, 108310475: 3, 200386343: 3, 110619029: 3, 108014881: 3, 200489777: 3, 200297969: 3, 112073495: 3, 200929612: 3, 200430991: 3, 200907207: 3, 106403737: 2, 107532062: 2, 107068335: 2, 106869562: 2, 107592563: 2, 106022427: 2, 107323239: 2, 107658264: 2, 106928959: 2, 106044572: 2, 107438587: 2, 107587392: 2, 106945872: 2, 106089213: 2, 106098470: 2, 106117267: 2, 107093945: 2, 106610663: 2, 105949578: 2, 107902567: 2, 106207412: 2, 106297607: 2, 106097690: 2, 106001645: 2, 106054402: 2, 106062921: 2, 105829522: 2, 106407009: 2, 106108233: 2, 106358364: 2, 105801876: 2, 106715003: 2, 106749092: 2, 106817494: 2, 106841465: 2, 106803582: 2, 105851541: 2, 106822110: 2, 106680929: 2, 106580951: 2, 106985791: 2, 106405973: 2, 107238223: 2, 106897206: 2, 108082584: 2, 108118109: 2, 107723931: 2, 107304112: 2, 109094525: 2, 107671020: 2, 106394111: 2, 106871882: 2, 107625137: 2, 107792163: 2, 107651072: 2, 106238291: 2, 106649711: 2, 108711756: 2, 107645068: 2, 108857424: 2, 108363423: 2, 108253466: 2, 107819171: 2, 106905703: 2, 109328122: 2, 106732573: 2, 106736701: 2, 109340308: 2, 108587636: 2, 107544688: 2, 108200561: 2, 108287262: 2, 109585728: 2, 107499312: 2, 109632996: 2, 107185927: 2, 109142435: 2, 105886625: 2, 109620395: 2, 109856888: 2, 110735180: 2, 110409351: 2, 110901677: 2, 110427480: 2, 108988764: 2, 110148121: 2, 108590756: 2, 108037217: 2, 108981414: 2, 107494185: 2, 109086735: 2, 109907430: 2, 107929356: 2, 109692317: 2, 111281190: 2, 112037097: 2, 110315255: 2, 108652563: 2, 109193524: 2, 111546553: 2, 110631955: 2, 108463947: 2, 112341216: 2, 108543998: 2, 112841766: 2, 109586477: 2, 111724726: 2, 110221855: 2, 200069906: 2, 200054289: 2, 111999314: 2, 111777299: 2, 112546186: 2, 111921737: 2, 107955068: 2, 107318184: 2, 108111761: 2, 200039487: 2, 200148833: 2, 108375637: 2, 107569651: 2, 200299671: 2, 112172937: 2, 109411750: 2, 109451199: 2, 112924258: 2, 106858324: 2, 111308179: 2, 108793472: 2, 109057647: 2, 110340063: 2, 110452119: 2, 106571266: 2, 200168968: 2, 108225547: 2, 200285286: 2, 200634307: 2, 200936538: 2, 200657119: 2, 106999733: 1, 105812440: 1, 107400819: 1, 105886712: 1, 105889415: 1, 107552617: 1, 106619581: 1, 106797746: 1, 107748535: 1, 107803888: 1, 108087249: 1, 108298258: 1, 108307042: 1, 107493811: 1, 107735256: 1, 108222065: 1, 106209804: 1, 200267314: 1, 111496831: 1}"

It's a good route for early leaders, as protection is plentiful and the line is fairly straight.  This climb is located directly behind the Chockstone Boulders. Follow a trail before or after the huge boulders a couple minutes down the road from Uberfall.  P1: Follow a crack system up and left to a short right-facing dihedral with a small overhang, directly behind a tree. Continue up the face to a larger overhang (piton) with big holds. Protect your follower after you've pulled the roof, then move 15' right to belay at bolt anchor shared with Classic. 5.5, 80'.  If you're setting this up for newer followers, make sure to protect the roof well for them; otherwise they'll have to pass the roof to the right, which is much harder than 5.5, and usually involves a lot of noise.  P2: Start above where you pulled the roof; angle left, passing the overhang to the face above. 5.3, 80'.  Descent: From the top, rappel from the bolted anchor to climber's right (2015).

P1: Start just right of Classic, and climb up the offwidthy ramp on the right to a stance at the bottom of a chimney. Find a way up (crux) into the main corner system, then follow the corner up through the steep but relatively easy chimney sections above, to the big ledge. 5.9, 80 ft.  You can build a belay in the corner, or traverse ~25 feet left to belay at the shared bolt anchor.  P2: Climb through a long flake system located on the right, up the corner, past another roof to an arete, and head to the trees.  P1 and P2 can be run together, but consider that the crux is quite low; between noise from the road and a set-back belay, it's unlikely that you'll hear your follower if s/he has trouble.

From the Uberfall, walk about 2.5 minutes down the carriage road, past the big corner and roof of Matinee, to a huge boulder just below the cliff. Take the access trail just beyond the boulder, and angle left to the cliff, on the left side of the huge boulder. Baby is the striking, widening crack directly above the access trail.  P1: Climb the crack to the wide section. Place a 3-4"" piece for pro, and head up into the offwidth (crux). A 5-inch piece is necessary if you want gear to protect the crux; otherwise you're at least 5-10' above gear as you commit to the wide. Continue up the face above to a big ledge with lots of loose rock and a bolted anchor. 5.6, 80'.  P2: Climb a left-facing corner and an overhang to the top. This pitch can be sandy after a recent rain. 5.6, 60'.  Descent: From the cliff top, rappel from the bolted anchor.","{107217526: 4, 107228100: 4, 106095805: 4, 10589: 4, 105927660: 4, 105798761: 4, 105889415: 4, 106299993: 4, 107499312: 4, 106407009: 4,

Climb the short crack through the overhang (crux), then go right to a belay/rappel tree or go up to the GT ledge.     P3: From the GT ledge, a good 7+/8 move off the ledge leads to sustained pumpy jug-hauling through a devious notch.

This pitch is not for the faint of heart, or the faint of followers!   as of 8/2016: There is a very scary looking fallen tree hanging over the edge of the GT Ledge almost directly on top of pitch 2. Balanced on top of the fallen tree is a large boulder. Please be very careful walking over the tree to the rap rings (climbers right).     P3:  Climb the first right-facing corner on the left, ~10 feet high.  Step left, and continue up to the top, passing a bulge.

Continue up the face above to a 2-bolt anchor on a good ledge. 5.7, 90'.Descend via two raps with a 60m rope.","{10762: 4, 106874511: 4, 10909: 4, 12448: 4, 106785304: 4, 107515236: 4, 107257835: 4, 106207412: 4, 106087077: 4, 14537: 4, 105842979: 4, 106344939: 4, 106588555: 4, 106214584: 4, 108189638: 4, 107089682: 4, 107678965: 4, 108401191: 4, 107629487: 4, 107819171: 4, 111169936: 4, 108032974: 4, 107277941: 4, 109193524: 4, 110735872: 4, 111955057: 4, 112926469: 4, 111824829: 4, 107955068: 4, 109437284: 4, 112423730: 4, 200141580: 4, 108270928: 4, 105898385: 4, 200067404: 4, 112086258: 4, 111844655: 4, 107217526: 3, 105886712: 3, 106403737: 3, 10185: 3, 107232016: 3, 106999733: 3, 12371: 3, 107658399: 3, 105795015: 3, 105961696: 3, 107735208: 3, 105899901: 3, 106299993: 3, 107783937: 3, 105904878: 3, 106932322: 3, 107561935: 3, 106224522: 3, 106089213: 3, 106098470: 3, 14568: 3, 107493811: 3, 107323239: 3, 107786688: 3, 107238223: 3, 107792493: 3, 106041457: 3, 106297607: 3, 105811146: 3, 107902567: 3, 105899248: 3, 106890022: 3, 105846944: 3, 106108233: 3, 106290147: 3, 106335624: 3, 106071787: 3, 106477370: 3, 105892598: 3, 105851541: 3, 106151063: 3, 105808487: 3, 105832216: 3, 106619581: 3, 106788981: 3, 11690: 3, 106001645: 3, 106904560: 3, 106864388: 3, 106607660: 3, 107026497: 3, 106347425: 3, 106748471: 3, 106841465: 3, 106596992: 3, 107548455: 3, 105891309: 3, 106933730: 3, 107663290: 3, 108082584: 3, 106963929: 3, 106717383: 3, 107217151: 3, 107767801: 3, 10168: 3, 108293163: 3, 107254662: 3, 15093: 3, 107226876: 3, 106238291: 3, 106649711: 3, 108119334: 3, 106897206: 3, 108156518: 3, 106449525: 3, 107518458: 3, 108363423: 3, 107178254: 3, 108483223: 3, 108187975: 3, 108805745: 3, 108985107: 3, 106993942: 3, 107617264: 3, 107142289: 3, 107696530: 3, 106542092: 3, 108409574: 3, 107723931: 3, 107928271: 3, 106586290: 3, 107748535: 3, 109816235: 3, 106879280: 3, 108265416: 3, 107735256: 3, 108889699: 3, 108324210: 3, 110901677: 3, 109018466: 3, 108982544: 3, 108367150: 3, 108731818: 3, 110619029: 3, 110148121: 3, 108857846: 3, 105890911: 3, 107755397: 3, 107872722: 3, 107830036: 3, 106486112: 3, 110232694: 3, 109659244: 3, 106398706: 3, 108305825: 3, 106022427: 3, 109284031: 3, 107544688: 3, 111781359: 3, 112037097: 3, 108014034: 3, 112077176: 3, 108478944: 3, 111546553: 3, 108985245: 3, 107194267: 3, 109737113: 3, 107548227: 3, 107412430: 3, 111850994: 3, 106210225: 3, 111857489: 3, 107691094: 3, 110494556: 3, 108463947: 3, 108124265: 3, 112352056: 3, 110534118: 3, 107146835: 3, 109187861: 3, 112843761: 3, 106895019: 3, 107929356: 3, 107246852: 3, 112134112: 3, 110165451: 3, 111777299: 3, 111811598: 3, 109373249: 3, 111308179: 3, 200132932: 3, 112449870: 3, 107545559: 3, 200187164: 3, 106209804: 3, 109451199: 3, 200108528: 3, 111657384: 3, 107469778: 3, 108103821: 3, 109316126: 3, 110337843: 3, 110689679: 3, 200176552: 3, 112091216: 3, 200249886: 3, 106571266: 3, 109414386: 3, 108652563: 3, 108361107: 3, 112129540: 3, 200581847: 3, 109542989: 3, 112373727: 3, 200489777: 3, 10270: 3, 200635570: 3, 110548079: 3, 109516598: 3, 200371228: 3, 111849990: 3, 200294652: 3, 200810232: 3, 200634307: 3, 200183967: 3, 200350797: 3, 112529638: 3, 106589007: 3, 107646553: 2, 107771322: 2, 105831725: 2, 106117267: 2, 106197143: 2, 106430658: 2, 106493776: 2, 106773591: 2, 106762873: 2, 106301735: 2, 106125724: 2, 106555971: 2, 106749092: 2, 106985791: 2, 106680875: 2, 106405973: 2, 106755817: 2, 106394111: 2, 107093945: 2, 107228100: 2, 108087199: 2, 107185927: 2, 106953954: 2, 107671020: 2, 107842362: 2, 107803888: 2, 108099571: 2, 108329997: 2, 107989551: 2, 106146571: 2, 106666369: 2, 107768989: 2, 105798761: 2, 109563509: 2, 108202763: 2, 107417154: 2, 109767025: 2, 108252197: 2, 107169450: 2, 107119375: 2, 108272772: 2, 110779176: 2, 108843325: 2, 109142435: 2, 106822110: 2, 109620395: 2, 110998345: 2, 107174265: 2, 107801617: 2, 110315255: 2, 109102869: 2, 110391323: 2, 110942763: 2, 112140841: 2, 111921737: 2, 200059743: 2, 110409351: 2, 200041551: 2, 106578430: 2, 108981414: 2, 107569651: 2, 109411750: 2, 112038160: 2, 200230321: 2, 106679659: 2, 108793472: 2, 112050276: 2, 107400819: 2, 107540375: 2, 106325770: 2, 200120733: 2, 200492491: 2, 112104580: 2, 200391298: 2, 200194815: 2, 107464151: 2, 110910691: 2, 200671914: 2, 110830564: 2, 108168914: 1, 110570814: 1, 111878504: 1, 200155809: 1}"

Start with a tricky bump to a good horizontal, crank up to a stance with a high foot. Repeat this move again - harder this time, with deck potential. Cut left at dirty grassy horizontals to a long rightward sweeping crack. Small gear may be had here. Crimp and balance your way on small holds on black rock for 15+ feet. If all the pebbles stay in you'll make it to a good ledge and easier climbing to the rap station.","{107246852: 2, 106897206: 2, 106108233: 2, 106344939: 1, 107548455: 1}"
Drunkard's Delight,105897523,Trad,107039036,5.8-,180,2,2.9,243.0,"The beginning is tricky and scary if this is your limit.  The reward is one of the best 5.6 roofs in the Gunks!    Walk a few minutes down the carriage road to the access trail. It is in the same area as Frog's Head, Maria and Sixish. Start at a thin crack that angles up and right and then becomes vertical, about 20' right of Sixish.    P1: Climb the face left of the crack, traverse right (crux), and continue up the face to a big roof. Belay here. 5.8-, 100'.    P2: Angle out right over the roof (5.6), and then angle up left to a tree on the GT Ledge.  5.6, 80'.      From here, you can rappel to the ground with two 60m ropes.  With one rope, traverse left on the GT ledge to the Frog's Head bolt line.    P1 and P2 can easily be linked, but be aware that the second will almost certainly face groundfall from the crux due to rope stretch.

Easy Street,106281218,Trad,107039036,5.6,200,2,2.6,177.0,"There is a bunch of great climbing on this route. The first and second pitch have a very different character and both are recommended.    The first pitch follows the large right facing corner all of the way to the GT ledge. This is fun and surprisingly steep and exposed climbing. Belay from one of several trees, depending on whether you're rapping or continuing upwards. (5.7 G/PG; a single 60m gets you down from here)    Pitch two continues up a right facing corner above the first pitch at the left end of the 5' roof for a few moves until you can traverse to the right (var), aiming diagonally up to the end of the roof. Continue up the path of least resistance to a tree above a detached block or to the top of the cliff.     Variation (5.7), courtesy of divnamite: Instead of traversing right under the roof, exit at the left side of the big roof, then move up right to a finger crack roof.  Climb the roof to the top.  It's a really nice variation.    Rappel from that tree (two ropes), walk ~100 yards right to the bolted rappel line over Ribs (single rope), or walk off left back to the Uberfall Descent.","{107551540: 4, 107228100: 4, 107493811: 4, 106822110: 4, 106913581: 4, 107518458: 4, 108338368: 4, 108363423: 4, 108394904: 4, 110391323: 4, 111919008: 4, 109542989: 4, 106529846: 4, 108329997: 4, 108294441: 4, 200313362: 4, 106403737: 3, 106299993: 3, 107226876: 3, 106297607: 3, 107902567: 3, 105929951: 3, 106890022: 3, 106001645: 3, 106087077: 3, 106687445: 3, 105790750: 3, 106263368: 3, 106841465: 3, 106407009: 3, 106555971: 3, 106749092: 3, 106797746: 3, 106933730: 3, 106554048: 3, 107134320: 3, 106803582: 3, 106214584: 3, 107267227: 3, 107238223: 3, 107232016: 3, 106755863: 3, 107691094: 3, 107304112: 3, 107185927: 3, 108293163: 3, 105886625: 3, 108187975: 3, 107257835: 3, 108073727: 3, 108156518: 3, 108459213: 3, 106449525: 3, 108401124: 3, 107397192: 3, 108985107: 3, 107830036: 3, 106666369: 3, 107629487: 3, 107464151: 3, 109525957: 3, 108905794: 3, 106398706: 3, 108879734: 3, 107625137: 3, 110409351: 3, 110536657: 3, 108188613: 3, 109090889: 3, 109620395: 3, 111169936: 3, 110494556: 3, 106630260: 3, 106022427: 3, 111861617: 3, 110532423: 3, 106712274: 3, 112467439: 3, 111811598: 3, 108857846: 3, 107142289: 3, 112343811: 3, 109187861: 3, 107783937: 3, 200166602: 3, 109451199: 3, 112212229: 3, 107318184: 3, 200177128: 3, 200240407: 3, 112423730: 3, 108103821: 3, 106108233: 3, 200265615: 3, 110270698: 3, 200492491: 3, 108014881: 3, 200376631: 3, 107525760: 3, 112373727: 3, 111700905: 3, 106778424: 2, 106719962: 2, 107106675: 2, 107483048: 2, 106999733: 2, 105798761: 2, 106596992: 2, 106394111: 2, 107093945: 2, 107548455: 2, 105904878: 2, 106089213: 2, 106430658: 2, 105889415: 2, 106751248: 2, 106301735: 2, 106732573: 2, 106591608: 2, 106503119: 2, 107395144: 2, 108168914: 2, 108087249: 2, 108336210: 2, 108401191: 2, 107768989: 2, 107363666: 2, 107212540: 2, 108182872: 2, 108082584: 2, 108581360: 2, 107914961: 2, 108202763: 2, 110359430: 2, 106993942: 2, 109737113: 2, 110735180: 2, 110866897: 2, 110148121: 2, 108981414: 2, 110363121: 2, 108305825: 2, 109018466: 2, 111841723: 2, 106325770: 2, 110839245: 2, 106210225: 2, 106578430: 2, 109586477: 2, 108259746: 2, 109393254: 2, 112140841: 2, 106209804: 2, 108985245: 2, 109411750: 2, 200267314: 2, 112846385: 2, 200228539: 2, 106858324: 2, 110712867: 2, 200299483: 2, 106571266: 2, 200224193: 2, 200187164: 2, 200267777: 2, 106125724: 1, 105892598: 1, 107803888: 1, 108104429: 1, 107735256: 1, 109632996: 1, 107417154: 1, 109052547: 1, 109767025: 1, 110164339: 1, 107569651: 1, 110062671: 1}"

The first piece of gear goes on a vertical crack below this big ledge (below your feet).  Make a delicate move to an intermediate stance at the start of the flake, place some mediocre gear (#2 Ball Nut, #3 WC Stone). Step up to a good undercling and place a #0 Metolius Master Cam (or similar) back left before fully embarking into the crux. There is risk of serious injury if one were to fall before placing this micro cam.  Committing moves through the flake get you to the horizontal with an angle pin (along with grass and dirt...); back the pin up with a small can. From here reach for the right facing corner above and to the right (lousy feet). The crux is only over when you're standing after completing this sequence.  Step left and climb the face straight up until you're a few feet below a short left-facing corner; from here angle up and right to the top of the Baby P1 and its bolt anchor.","{107493811: 3, 109102869: 3, 107929356: 3, 108793472: 3, 107246852: 2, 106325770: 1, 11690: 1, 106344939: 1, 107093945: 1}"

Jean,106089657,Trad,107039036,5.9+,70,1,2.4,84.0,A classic roof problem that serves as a great introduction to harder roofs.    P1: Climb the small left-facing corner to a small stance.  Surf right then back left through a deceptive little sequence.  Head up the main left-facing corner to the roof.  Pull over this (crux) to arrive at the fixed rap anchor.

Maria,105799774,Trad,107039036,5.6,220,3,3.1,288.0,"Another classic moderate, with three varied pitches.  Follow the approach directions for City Lights. Maria starts 25' right of City Lights, at a crack in a white block. The start is the same as for Frog's Head and Sundown, though with some creativity (noted below), multiple parties can easily share the start(s).  P1: Climb Frog's Head (note 1) until just past the crux bulge (note 2). Place pro for your second, then traverse about 35' right on thin face, with little pro, to the base of a large, left-facing corner. 5.6, 80'.  Note 1: An alternative start that avoids (climbers on) Frog's Head entirely is climb the right-facing corner with the detached block forming a squeeze chimney, to the right (5.6ish). This is the start for Sundown, and is more in line with the corners and the grade of Maria.  Note 2: It's possible to start diagonaling up then traversing right from just below the crux bulge on Frog's Head instead of just above it. Both options are well protected.  Finally, Maria Direct, at 5.9, is another option for the first pitch; the thin crack directly below the main Maria corner is Maria Redirect (5.11)  P2: Climb the steep corner to the GT Ledge. 5.6+, 90'.  P3: Reposition your belay 15 feet right from the top of the corner. Climb a right-facing corner to an overhang, turn the overhang on the left via a crack, and continue to the top. 5.6+, 50'.  Descent: From the GT Ledge, move climber's left to a bolted rap, where two 30m raps bring you to the ground.

Rappel City Lights, or use Uberfall Descent.","{105949578: 4, 106297607: 4, 106607660: 4, 107097681: 4, 107417154: 4, 110735872: 4, 108329997: 4, 106030548: 3, 107483048: 3, 105795015: 3, 107267683: 3, 107771322: 3, 106299993: 3, 105904878: 3, 106224522: 3, 106687445: 3, 106542092: 3, 106282223: 3, 106108233: 3, 106619581: 3, 105899248: 3, 11690: 3, 106596992: 3, 106897206: 3, 106405973: 3, 106394111: 3, 107678965: 3, 106146571: 3, 108082584: 3, 107185927: 3, 106102123: 3, 107671020: 3, 106411326: 3, 107493811: 3, 107232016: 3, 105891309: 3, 106449525: 3, 107518458: 3, 107238223: 3, 107629487: 3, 108985107: 3, 107768989: 3, 106586268: 3, 106993942: 3, 109563509: 3, 107928271: 3, 108529353: 3, 108363423: 3, 107803888: 3, 106741264: 3, 107735256: 3, 106246427: 3, 109142435: 3, 108805745: 3, 108857846: 3, 109102869: 3, 110148121: 3, 109990981: 3, 108320578: 3, 110164339: 3, 109328345: 3, 110839245: 3, 108463947: 3, 109193524: 3, 109737113: 3, 112343811: 3, 107146835: 3, 112140841: 3, 107929356: 3, 110315255: 3, 110262051: 3, 111850994: 3, 108189638: 3, 106209804: 3, 200108528: 3, 111777299: 3, 111811598: 3, 108793472: 3, 107417501: 3, 108103821: 3, 112129540: 3, 105898385: 3, 10270: 3, 200330063: 3, 110524225: 3, 105788804: 2, 107618553: 2, 105886096: 2, 106841465: 2, 105961696: 2, 107400819: 2, 105943577: 2, 106089213: 2, 106117267: 2, 105946742: 2, 106071787: 2, 106430658: 2, 106290147: 2, 105832216: 2, 106423391: 2, 13658: 2, 107026497: 2, 106933730: 2, 107217151: 2, 108073727: 2, 107254662: 2, 106344939: 2, 107688970: 2, 107548455: 2, 106588555: 2, 107178254: 2, 107093945: 2, 106999733: 2, 108252197: 2, 105851541: 2, 107194267: 2, 109816235: 2, 108731818: 2, 106822110: 2, 108032974: 2, 107755397: 2, 111461534: 2, 108547929: 2, 111169936: 2, 108305825: 2, 110998345: 2, 109018466: 2, 108014034: 2, 106098789: 2, 106210225: 2, 111691526: 2, 112841766: 2, 107569651: 2, 110746025: 2, 106920912: 2, 107246852: 2, 112192174: 2, 111308179: 2, 110409351: 2, 111857489: 2, 112091216: 2, 109451199: 2, 106571266: 2, 108652563: 2, 112050276: 2, 200256148: 2, 200492491: 2, 107206725: 2, 200120733: 2, 106097690: 1, 110534118: 1, 107142289: 1, 107540375: 1}"

The first move off the ground is a bit tricky.  Continue up left to a stance and gear.  Aim up and left towards a left-facing flake/corner, then angle up and back right to a thin vertical black crack that is difficult to protect. At the top of the crack there is a pod for good gear, though you will be in ground-fall range by then. Head up thin holds to easier climbing to the tree with rings.  One rope here will get you back to the ground.    P2: Step right and continue past an overhang to the GT ledge.

Described by Seth:   I sent my partner up pitch 3 of Rock & Brew by mistake yesterday. (We were trying to do pitch three of Morning After.)  Dick says 5.8 R and I think he's right.      The starting moves up bulgy white rock would be nice except you have to fight with a pine tree to make progress. You don't really mind the tree, however, since it's the only source of pro. Then nice moves take you past the right-facing flakes with good pro.    Then you get to the real problem. You reach another pine tree and above you is a blank slab with with no pro leading to the top. The rap tree for Rusty Trifle is off to the right, but traversing over is also lacking in pro. My partner chose to traverse to the rap tree, risking a pendulum if he fell. His choice left me with the same pendulum risk as a second. Served me right.    If I'd been leading I probably would have put my cordalette around the top pine on Rock & Brew and bailed. The pitch was pretty decent up to that point, but i don't recommend it.

From the clifftop, descend via the Uberfall Descent.","{106822110: 4, 107265789: 4, 107635248: 4, 107551540: 4, 105811146: 4, 106108233: 4, 106087077: 4, 106580951: 4, 107663290: 4, 108187975: 4, 108205352: 4, 108293163: 4, 107254662: 4, 106449525: 4, 107914961: 4, 109206590: 4, 109856888: 4, 108849186: 4, 111983604: 4, 112070348: 4, 106210225: 4, 110923255: 4, 200141084: 4, 107246852: 4, 112423730: 4, 200253316: 4, 200187164: 4, 106209804: 4, 110340063: 4, 109597474: 4, 108363423: 4, 200176844: 4, 109005921: 4, 112129540: 4, 200386343: 4, 110253489: 4, 109142435: 4, 112924258: 4, 112373727: 4, 200208380: 4, 200416944: 4, 200463147: 4, 107548227: 4, 107217526: 3, 107518458: 3, 107262260: 3, 107228100: 3, 107493811: 3, 107560092: 3, 11926: 3, 105889415: 3, 105904878: 3, 106554048: 3, 106299993: 3, 107093945: 3, 107232016: 3, 105929951: 3, 107561935: 3, 106044572: 3, 106928959: 3, 107902567: 3, 106204631: 3, 106141117: 3, 107919874: 3, 106205646: 3, 106477370: 3, 106407009: 3, 106430658: 3, 106749092: 3, 106751248: 3, 106762873: 3, 106607660: 3, 106913581: 3, 106797746: 3, 106347425: 3, 107238223: 3, 106596992: 3, 107592563: 3, 107272204: 3, 108082584: 3, 107953182: 3, 108169776: 3, 107142289: 3, 107174265: 3, 107723931: 3, 108019457: 3, 107304112: 3, 106102123: 3, 107671020: 3, 106871882: 3, 108298258: 3, 108189638: 3, 105886625: 3, 107748535: 3, 108307042: 3, 107651072: 3, 107872722: 3, 107620691: 3, 106238291: 3, 107178254: 3, 107553094: 3, 107735256: 3, 107819171: 3, 109340308: 3, 107768989: 3, 107544688: 3, 108985245: 3, 105851541: 3, 108879734: 3, 109136692: 3, 107928271: 3, 110359430: 3, 107830036: 3, 109451199: 3, 107746838: 3, 108157281: 3, 108652563: 3, 110735180: 3, 109585728: 3, 109226330: 3, 109404273: 3, 110409351: 3, 108362531: 3, 110148121: 3, 107629487: 3, 108394904: 3, 108590756: 3, 108981414: 3, 107226876: 3, 108032974: 3, 111289156: 3, 109018466: 3, 110425509: 3, 110262051: 3, 111898188: 3, 107876007: 3, 107068306: 3, 112037097: 3, 111850994: 3, 110462006: 3, 109581184: 3, 111955057: 3, 109193524: 3, 109869056: 3, 112272041: 3, 111829790: 3, 112026934: 3, 109737113: 3, 110369169: 3, 107773063: 3, 110391323: 3, 110816178: 3, 106551194: 3, 111657384: 3, 109692317: 3, 109393254: 3, 200123478: 3, 107146835: 3, 108155086: 3, 110144057: 3, 200174103: 3, 108103821: 3, 110784456: 3, 200085165: 3, 106689477: 3, 107783937: 3, 109187861: 3, 200166602: 3, 200235631: 3, 200123489: 3, 109472534: 3, 106858324: 3, 200148833: 3, 106403737: 3, 112042073: 3, 112449870: 3, 112525633: 3, 109505100: 3, 109488917: 3, 111999314: 3, 200067404: 3, 200235773: 3, 108793472: 3, 200248995: 3, 109057647: 3, 200381554: 3, 106571266: 3, 200282021: 3, 200345231: 3, 200253280: 3, 200297969: 3, 108014881: 3, 200253285: 3, 112143262: 3, 110619029: 3, 107525760: 3, 111900615: 3, 112823201: 3, 200155809: 3, 112846385: 3, 200605163: 3, 10270: 3, 200492491: 3, 200635570: 3, 200120733: 3, 110270698: 3, 108701917: 3, 107459332: 3, 200443436: 3, 200634307: 3, 108106981: 3, 200273342: 3, 108329997: 3, 200227654: 3, 200150625: 3, 106999733: 2, 105798761: 2, 106824315: 2, 12448: 2, 107400819: 2, 106030368: 2, 106089213: 2, 106117267: 2, 106097690: 2, 106344939: 2, 106687445: 2, 105832216: 2, 106817494: 2, 106841465: 2, 13658: 2, 106732573: 2, 106933730: 2, 106125724: 2, 108073727: 2, 107185927: 2, 106405973: 2, 106993942: 2, 107068335: 2, 107866982: 2, 108401191: 2, 108228481: 2, 107835722: 2, 106297607: 2, 108905794: 2, 107696530: 2, 107929356: 2, 109585732: 2, 110552303: 2, 108843325: 2, 108988764: 2, 111541482: 2, 111641141: 2, 110494556: 2, 106022427: 2, 109586477: 2, 110998345: 2, 107065373: 2, 111934737: 2, 108181003: 2, 107412430: 2, 111546553: 2, 111857489: 2, 200062003: 2, 200069906: 2, 111921737: 2, 107100666: 2, 109437284: 2, 111777299: 2, 200299671: 2, 200281660: 2, 105967115: 2, 106656746: 2, 111810534: 2, 200267314: 2, 105886426: 2, 111849990: 2, 110712867: 2, 110452119: 2, 200396867: 2, 108111761: 2, 111308179: 2, 110524225: 2, 109638995: 2, 200158745: 2, 110830564: 2, 107464151: 1, 107097681: 1, 107682885: 1, 109767025: 1}"

For the best experience do it linked as a single pitch; it's fairly straight so rope-drag shouldn't be an issue.Use the same access trail as for City Lights, just below the striking widening crack of Baby. The climb starts 45' left of City Lights, at a thin jagged crack with a piton about 15' up.P1: Thin face climbing and jamming will lead to a 2' ledge. 5.8, 90'. Build your own belay either directly under the corner above, or on gear 15' to the left, or exit 30' left to the rappel bolts over Easy Overhang.P2: Aim for the overhanging left-facing corner system. If your belay is to the left of the main corner, you can traverse 10'-15' to the right on a sandy horizontal; there are pitons at the start and end of the traverse. The climbing is steep, and the feet are not as good as you might like. Fire through the steep rock above on well-spaced jugs. When you see the last, large blocky hold in a straight line of chalked-up holds, step right onto the face above, then head straight up to the anchor. Avoid the temptation to follow the chalk and go left, this leads to a long meandering route to the finish with bad rope drag. 5.8, 70'.There is a piton anchor below the top of the cliff. Rappel from here (single 70m, or double 60s) to avoid the pebbly gully above.

It follows very closely to the right of Frog's Head, and at some points you can actually reach out and tickle your neighbor (NOT RECOMMENDED!).  Begin behind the right side of the Frog's Head block for a series of chimney moves (read: groveling). The chimney moves edge towards the 5.7 range. The start overlaps to some extent with Frog's Head and/or Maria, so you may have to negotiate for space.  Once you are on the route proper, climb the thin and beautiful orange face (crux) past a small vertical crack and some long reaches between good, albeit small, horizontals. The climbing lets up quite a bit, then you can continue to enjoy mellow and airy Gunks face climbing all the way to the Frog's Head chain anchors atop the flake/block, or to the bolted rappel anchors to the right.

From Rick Cronk: The FA of the offwidth below the Bloody Bush ledge, originally known as Rusty Jam and now appearing as a variation at 5.9, was done by myself, Matt Muchnik, Kevin Bein, Rich Perch and John Bragg in 1975. It involved a complete ascent of three pitches to the top. Bein, Perch and Bragg continued on their way along the Trapps from the top of the first pitch. Not knowing of the undocumented 1950's ascent of Bloody Bush (Easy Street), Muchnik and I continued up that corner to the GT. Our third pitch wandered up just left of Rusty Trifle to the top. After 9 years Swain and party added a new separate 2nd pitch and a new name. So it goes.    From the ledge, make a big step up and out left onto a smaller ledge, then climb up 10 feet or so to a small roof; just above the roof there is a shallow seam. Move slightly left until you are standing on good footholds, then go straight up to a large horizontal. Back right a few feet, then climb straight up to a large pine tree. As described, this pitch is often empty, and has good protection (albeit with a bit of work) and interesting moves.     There are several pitches to be climbed from the GT ledge. Straight up from the rappel tree is easy, 5.5 or so, jugs and overlaps to a right-facing white corner (this is P3 of Rusty Trifle?).      Next-left is a runout, somewhat harder pitch.      Over further left (30' or so), you can climb trending right up discontinuous cracks at about 5.8 and PG; the Williams guide describes this as the top pitch of Trusty Rifle.

Two suggestions for leaders with inexperienced followers: It is better to belay P1 from a tree immediately after the crux, then move the belay station to the GT ledge (only 10 feet of class 3 scramble), which will put you directly under the crux roof of P2.  Also, because Wrist is just above the hairpin turn, it can be very hard to hear your second below the roof on P2. If there's any chance the second will blow the traverse, belay from the horizontal cracks above the roof.

P3, 5.8 PG: Look up and spot a hanging, right-facing corner that is about five feet high and is just underneath a ceiling. This corner is maybe ten feet to the left of the right edge of the wall. You're aiming for this hanging corner.  Start up the face almost at the right edge of the wall, and drift diagonally up and left for 8 or 10 feet until you reach a shallow overlap. From the overlap, wander a bit right then back left, in order to position yourself underneath the hanging corner. Clip the pin and then figure out how to go straight up (crux) to the top of the corner, under the ceiling. Place bomber gear at the ceiling (whew), and make the slightly easier exposed moves out left to escape the overhang. Scamper straight to the top, passing some very nice slab climbing in the last ten feet before the top of the cliff.            The climbing around the overlap and hanging corner is kind of pumpy and in-your-face until you finish the crux.

P1: Climb to the right of a small tiered overhang near the ground. Wander up, aiming generally left towards the right-facing dihedral (the original route belayed here), then head up steep rock into the left-facing corner/roof. Work up into the roof, then escape right to the bolts (and protect your follower(s)!). Belay at bolts. 5.7, 100'.

If you're continuing on, clip 'em put a long runner on it, 'cause your about to head right. Way right, on an exciting ride. There is a pointed flake out there in the distance ... head that way, and when you get there don't forget about your second! Continue along the exciting hand traverse across the flake to the bolt anchors above MF. Belay.  Pitch two will require a bit of wandering to get up and into the business. From the MF bolts, head left a touch to a flake in the ""ceiling"", wait now come back right, now crank up and over the ceiling on the flake to a stance...don't forget about how your gonna sew this one up, but don't kill yourself with rope drag either. From here the route continues straight up, connecting with MF.  We actually rapped from the mentioned stance above the crux on the second pitch. There was a scary fixed anchor that consisted of an alien with clipped wires, a TCU with clipped wires and a tricam...we lived.  From the clifftop, there are bolts to the left above Three Pines. Three rappels with a single rope will get you to the ground.","{105904878: 4, 106106830: 4, 106120622: 4, 106041457: 4, 106089213: 4, 10270: 4, 105878863: 4, 105816899: 4, 106493776: 4, 106151063: 4, 106588732: 4, 105846944: 4, 14152: 4, 105854232: 4, 107246852: 4, 106985791: 4, 106246445: 4, 106394111: 4, 107663290: 4, 106933730: 4, 108459213: 4, 106325770: 4, 108032974: 4, 108401191: 4, 107226876: 4, 107232016: 4, 108843325: 4, 108363902: 4, 109142435: 4, 109816235: 4, 108363423: 4, 108731818: 4, 105890911: 4, 107007527: 4, 106486112: 4, 108320578: 4, 109719701: 4, 108478944: 4, 111738589: 4, 111850994: 4, 110315255: 4, 105898385: 4, 12084: 4, 110937405: 4, 111777299: 4, 112042073: 4, 200108528: 4, 200145352: 4, 111969139: 4, 108103821: 4, 200067404: 4, 107412430: 4, 112373727: 4, 200635570: 4, 107540375: 4, 200466030: 4, 112192174: 4, 106224522: 3, 106405973: 3, 107658399: 3, 107743165: 3, 107400819: 3, 105859992: 3, 105832216: 3, 105899248: 3, 107678965: 3, 106282223: 3, 106411080: 3, 105892598: 3, 105886426: 3, 106619581: 3, 14595: 3, 11690: 3, 106024037: 3, 105851541: 3, 106058125: 3, 105828100: 3, 106762873: 3, 106407009: 3, 106571266: 3, 107238223: 3, 107093945: 3, 108289754: 3, 107629487: 3, 107185927: 3, 108159370: 3, 107767801: 3, 107768989: 3, 106928959: 3, 106125724: 3, 106666369: 3, 105891309: 3, 108082584: 3, 110619029: 3, 107194267: 3, 106897206: 3, 109620395: 3, 109659244: 3, 108305825: 3, 110946269: 3, 105823713: 3, 110998345: 3, 108939459: 3, 109990981: 3, 108234518: 3, 109193524: 3, 107929356: 3, 112097145: 3, 108463947: 3, 107932282: 3, 111955057: 3, 108367150: 3, 107142289: 3, 110148121: 3, 106852549: 3, 108805745: 3, 105798365: 3, 111974624: 3, 106879280: 3, 108793472: 3, 110409351: 3, 200167620: 3, 111004308: 3, 106209804: 3, 111841723: 3, 108270652: 3, 200130915: 3, 112091216: 3, 107830036: 3, 107380650: 3, 109018466: 3, 111308179: 3, 109638995: 3, 200158745: 3, 200176552: 3, 110830564: 3, 112129540: 3, 107459332: 3, 106189019: 3, 107533935: 3, 105811146: 2, 10168: 2, 106441937: 2, 106146571: 2, 107240862: 2, 107691094: 2, 111796230: 2, 107569651: 2, 200173263: 2, 106449525: 2, 200120733: 2, 110746025: 2, 111857489: 2, 106886632: 1}"

Climb straight up thin face about 15 feet to a very small ledge. From here climb the bulging face at a flake that is sitting on the small ledge. There is good gear to be had but it's strenuous to get; this section can be a little pumpy. Move slightly left and up to a small broken ledge and good rest. Continue up to the base of a nice left facing corner, get in some gear, and prepare to work up the tricky face just to the left of the corner. Next up is the crux overlap - get in bomber gear, and pull the technical and challenging sequence, moving up very slightly left and then back right, then follow a nice flake to just below the finish overhang. Pull over and traverse left to the chains shared with Star Action. ","{107206725: 4, 108270652: 4, 200178708: 4, 200108528: 4, 106238291: 4, 109168644: 4, 111822624: 4, 107771322: 4, 111829790: 4, 109719701: 4, 108529353: 4, 110619029: 4, 110225880: 4, 110315255: 4, 107768989: 4, 108843325: 4, 107629487: 4, 105798365: 4, 107886100: 4, 111850994: 4, 110148121: 4, 110746025: 4, 109638995: 4, 10270: 4, 200256288: 4, 109033387: 4, 107373153: 4, 108980384: 4, 200067404: 4, 107226876: 4, 200394444: 4, 111710269: 4, 200158745: 4, 107093945: 4, 200386608: 4, 107007527: 4, 112042073: 4, 112192174: 4, 109816235: 4, 107767801: 4, 106441937: 4, 105892598: 4, 106394111: 4, 106246445: 4, 10610: 4, 105828100: 4, 106405973: 4, 106607660: 4, 106619581: 4, 106423391: 4, 106071787: 4, 106089213: 4, 106985791: 4, 107246852: 4, 10510: 4, 106058125: 4, 107292527: 4, 108363902: 4, 105851541: 4, 107178254: 4, 106158624: 4, 108032974: 4, 106740823: 4, 106325770: 4, 108367150: 4, 106897206: 4, 108082584: 4, 107194267: 3, 107240862: 3, 106007648: 3, 109767025: 3, 10168: 3, 106449525: 3, 106646308: 3, 106637976: 3, 107902567: 3, 107142289: 3, 106571266: 3, 11690: 3, 108793472: 3, 111841723: 2, 200120733: 2}"

The route is located to the right of Three Pines on the right side of the Mac Wall.  P1: Climb the crack and face below the overhang, making a slight jog to the left. Once you're in the corner below the overhang, place gear in a horizontal on the face to your right, or just clip the piton. Hold your breath, and traverse right and up around the bulging roof onto a small ledge. Gain your balance and place some gear off to the right. Once you're past the roof, the 5.9 climbing doesn't let up, however!  Continue up then slightly left (~25'), finally finishing at a bolted anchor. The final moves on the steep wall above the roof are well protected but will test your endurance. A stimulating lead; 5.9, 80'.  Variation: Instead of moving right after clipping the piton, head straight up the overhang and climb the crack above to the anchor. 5.10a, R.  P2: Traverse right though a left-facing corner and through the notch in the roof. Continue upwards to a horizontal traverse to the left. Follow the right-facing dihedral to the GT Ledge. 5.9, 80'.  Descent: There is a bolted anchor atop P1. From P2, it is difficult to rappel to the P1 bolts due to the overhang. Instead, climb easier rock to the cliff top, then rappel the bolted line 50' to climber's left over Something Interesting, or descend with two ropes to the ground.","{106403737: 4, 10185: 4, 106412174: 4, 10909: 4, 106785304: 4, 107658399: 4, 105927660: 4, 105811636: 4, 107448536: 4, 12448: 4, 107383190: 4, 107771322: 4, 107400819: 4, 106299993: 4, 106049789: 4, 107475857: 4, 105859992: 4, 106655109: 4, 106071787: 4, 106089213: 4, 106120622: 4, 105961696: 4, 107238223: 4, 107093945: 4, 105889270: 4, 106571266: 4, 107902567: 4, 106139012: 4, 10150: 4, 105898385: 4, 105899248: 4, 106087077: 4, 106398812: 4, 14537: 4, 105878863: 4, 105816899: 4, 106407009: 4, 106290147: 4, 106449553: 4, 106151063: 4, 106108233: 4, 106493776: 4, 106405973: 4, 105899901: 4, 11156: 4, 105851541: 4, 106762873: 4, 106549589: 4, 105846944: 4, 106588555: 4, 14152: 4, 106942628: 4, 106607660: 4, 107099715: 4, 105854232: 4, 106389004: 4, 106959047: 4, 106953954: 4, 106985791: 4, 107003581: 4, 107246852: 4, 106794436: 4, 105828100: 4, 106022427: 4, 108082584: 4, 106579529: 4, 107406726: 4, 106687445: 4, 107807462: 4, 107767801: 4, 108289754: 4, 108234737: 4, 107768989: 4, 107678965: 4, 107696530: 4, 106720416: 4, 107629487: 4, 106360234: 4, 107226876: 4, 107185927: 4, 106933730: 4, 108156518: 4, 108202763: 4, 107551540: 4, 107026497: 4, 107548455: 4, 107663290: 4, 108473510: 4, 108032974: 4, 106486112: 4, 107427822: 4, 108367150: 4, 107553094: 4, 106666369: 4, 106075659: 4, 108266600: 4, 107620610: 4, 109646398: 4, 106542092: 4, 108000881: 4, 109816235: 4, 108311593: 4, 108529353: 4, 110185189: 4, 108843325: 4, 109193524: 4, 110735180: 4, 109142435: 4, 108266938: 4, 110619029: 4, 109608840: 4, 107872722: 4, 107194267: 4, 107434457: 4, 105890911: 4, 107574666: 4, 109659244: 4, 105798365: 4, 106210225: 4, 110396163: 4, 111016597: 4, 107929356: 4, 108320578: 4, 109990981: 4, 108981414: 4, 111983604: 4, 109383300: 4, 106714648: 4, 108899032: 4, 109023010: 4, 111955057: 4, 110148121: 4, 108181716: 4, 109719701: 4, 111738589: 4, 109018466: 4, 107232016: 4, 110315255: 4, 107224861: 4, 112546186: 4, 107142289: 4, 112050276: 4, 12084: 4, 111829790: 4, 106936938: 4, 109281879: 4, 109187861: 4, 106879280: 4, 110165451: 4, 110942763: 4, 110999688: 4, 107469778: 4, 200192072: 4, 111982873: 4, 109411750: 4, 200039487: 4, 111850994: 4, 110937405: 4, 110262051: 4, 110409351: 4, 200108528: 4, 110758970: 4, 106209804: 4, 108751329: 4, 108270652: 4, 106924298: 4, 111710269: 4, 107544688: 4, 110494556: 4, 110337843: 4, 109548512: 4, 111999314: 4, 200394444: 4, 108793472: 4, 200194507: 4, 200067404: 4, 111882861: 4, 107380650: 4, 200111570: 4, 112129540: 4, 200088269: 4, 112343811: 4, 112423730: 4, 108980384: 4, 108152222: 4, 107609575: 4, 111649446: 4, 108103821: 4, 112846385: 4, 109316126: 4, 112192174: 4, 112373727: 4, 111969490: 4, 10270: 4, 108994382: 4, 200145352: 4, 109638995: 4, 107928271: 4, 200158745: 4, 200371228: 4, 200256148: 4, 106741264: 4, 111921737: 4, 110548079: 4, 107529159: 4, 200635570: 4, 110746025: 4, 200849813: 4, 200350797: 4, 110293005: 4, 200120733: 4, 106342472: 4, 10168: 3, 10202: 3, 106999733: 3, 105829522: 3, 106125724: 3, 107174265: 3, 107618553: 3, 105832216: 3, 105886426: 3, 105880131: 3, 106441937: 3, 105812440: 3, 107671020: 3, 106207412: 3, 106095360: 3, 106297607: 3, 106054402: 3, 106007648: 3, 105811146: 3, 105801876: 3, 106344939: 3, 105892598: 3, 106235451: 3, 105808487: 3, 106591608: 3, 106423391: 3, 106619581: 3, 14595: 3, 11690: 3, 106848900: 3, 106058125: 3, 106864388: 3, 106637976: 3, 10610: 3, 106897206: 3, 106755817: 3, 108307042: 3, 107431656: 3, 107240862: 3, 108136088: 3, 106102123: 3, 108073727: 3, 108293163: 3, 107323487: 3, 107273411: 3, 107846658: 3, 108363423: 3, 106146571: 3, 107178254: 3, 108159370: 3, 108401191: 3, 106736701: 3, 108104429: 3, 109136692: 3, 108099571: 3, 105798761: 3, 107116332: 3, 109280290: 3, 106928959: 3, 109767025: 3, 108364313: 3, 109563509: 3, 108905794: 3, 105891309: 3, 107518458: 3, 108343834: 3, 110423556: 3, 109005921: 3, 105846604: 3, 110779176: 3, 108805745: 3, 108104464: 3, 107002071: 3, 107801617: 3, 107621814: 3, 107146835: 3, 106717383: 3, 107755397: 3, 111898188: 3, 108731818: 3, 108014034: 3, 108234518: 3, 108478944: 3, 112097145: 3, 109505100: 3, 111053951: 3, 108463947: 3, 107691094: 3, 110964058: 3, 107633879: 3, 111796230: 3, 112352056: 3, 109884427: 3, 110816178: 3, 107569651: 3, 106852549: 3, 108047997: 3, 106494505: 3, 111777299: 3, 107460666: 3, 111857489: 3, 109373249: 3, 106646308: 3, 200032696: 3, 109414386: 3, 107886100: 3, 112091216: 3, 106425299: 3, 200079158: 3, 200146694: 3, 200288455: 3, 200345231: 3, 200621286: 3, 106449525: 3, 200155809: 3, 200584755: 3, 106189019: 3, 200953909: 3, 107206725: 3, 110830564: 3, 106158262: 2, 106640547: 2, 112042073: 2, 111841723: 2, 110133075: 2, 106325770: 2, 105934900: 1}"

Overhanging Layback,106294662,Trad,107039700,5.7,180,2,2.6,90.0,"1. (100') Climb the corner to the overhang. Step right and then up and left - a tricky move. Continue left and up to small ledges below a face near an outside corner.  The anchor is a clump of medium-size trees with rap slings, and a 60m rope will get you down from there.    2. (60') Climb left, exit the corner after just a few feet, and head up the face, past flakes (some may be hollow and loose; one fell in 2013, and see comment below in 2016), to an overhang. Climb through the overhang, then another overhang, and up right to a big ledge and tree belay.    From Kurtz: The missing flake under the final overhang may have made the overhang on P2 significantly harder (5.8ish). I'm 6' tall and it was a big reach to the hard-to-see bomber jug. It's a very committing (but fun) move now. I didn't see any easier way out.    P3. Kurtz: P3 is really 3 short walls separated by grassy ledges. The first two are easy and protect well, the third is harder and slabby without any pro. It's only a couple of balancey moves, but they are challenging (5.8 PG)   Descent   From the top, one option is the Blueberry Ledges/Beginner's Delight rappels, to the north (the rings are 5 feet up in a medium sized tree, on a big grassy ledge). It takes three rappels with a 60m to get down. The first rappel is short, only about 65 feet long, and the second rap tree is easy to miss since it's quite a ways to the left; if you rap too far, you'll be hanging in space below a ledge. The third rap station is a whacky setup of red rope wrapped around a boulder. Despite the core-shot in one of the strands, it's currently safe enough but, for some reason, the rope tends to bind making it an absolute misery to pull.     A better option is to walk south (climbers' left) to the bolted rappel line over Three Pines. 3 60m rappels get you to the ground.","{107518458: 4, 108759814: 4, 108391173: 4, 107246852: 4, 200187164: 4, 200617907: 4, 109437284: 4, 109816235: 3, 109646398: 3, 108363423: 3, 109715819: 3, 110359430: 3, 108845522: 3, 107696530: 3, 200150942: 3, 108202763: 3, 108401191: 3, 108187975: 3, 106863637: 3, 108082584: 3, 112846385: 3, 112373727: 3, 107277941: 3, 106095990: 3, 110330190: 3, 105851541: 3, 107460666: 3, 107232016: 3, 109193524: 3, 107830036: 3, 107929356: 3, 111972856: 3, 107768989: 3, 108110425: 3, 107142289: 3, 106762873: 3, 106087077: 3, 106803582: 3, 106058125: 3, 107322165: 3, 106591608: 3, 105899248: 3, 106477370: 3, 106290147: 3, 107093945: 3, 106748471: 3, 107475857: 3, 106403737: 3, 110409351: 2, 105889270: 2, 106243160: 2, 111777299: 2, 200634307: 2, 107691094: 2, 107400819: 2, 107769068: 2, 106897206: 2, 106555971: 2, 106299993: 2, 112823201: 2, 112279586: 2, 108793472: 2, 108164781: 2, 106325770: 2, 106449525: 2, 106407009: 2, 105892598: 2, 106571266: 2, 107629487: 2, 107238223: 2, 106680875: 2, 108104429: 2, 106297607: 2, 106687445: 2, 106344939: 2, 106089213: 2, 106749092: 2, 106423391: 2, 110619029: 2, 109451199: 2, 107254662: 2, 105886625: 2, 11690: 2, 106210225: 2, 105889415: 2, 107625137: 1, 105798761: 1, 106953954: 1, 106841465: 0}"

I have not climbed P2, so the description is not mine.    P1 - Climb up to the overhang and traverse left to a seam.  Climb the seam and the bulge above (crux) to easier rock and a stance.  Escape left to Overhanging Layback, or move up and left to an overhang (5.8 R) then up past the overhang to a belay at a block (you can again escape left by traversing past a jammed block before the overhang).    P2 - Up the easy face to a white face and small right-facing corner capped by an overhang and fixed pins.  Move up left to another fixed pin (Lost Arrow), then up and left again to a right-facing corner (5.10a, crux) and a stance.  Follow the corner to a ceiling, exit left, and chimney up a past bird droppings to the GT ledge.","{106062921: 2, 107246852: 2, 11690: 1}"

Something Interesting,105799118,Trad,107039700,5.7+,200,2,3.5,508.0,"This great route is very popular, so plan ahead.  The Something Interesting access trail is about a 6-min. walk from the Uberfall, or a 2-min. walk from where the East Trapps Connector Trail meets the carriage road. When the leaves are down, you'll spot the crack from the carriage road, and the access trail is just a few feet further. At the cliff, walk left to get to the start, below a long crack about 30' right of Three Pines.  P1: Follow a right-leaning finger crack to a bulge with a large reach, then surmount that to a ledge. There are several pitons to reassure you that you're in the right place.  P2: Continue up the crack and fun face above to the GT ledge. Gear anchor.  It's easy enough to link P1 and P2 in one 140' pitch to the GT - just bring lots of runners and gear. It's possible to rappel from the Three Pines bolts at the GT ledge (2 ropes, or 2 raps with 1 rope).  P3: Climb a left-facing dihedral behind the (missing) pine tree to a the larger right-facing dihedral above. Follow this to a bolt anchor. 5.7+, 90'.  The Dangler used to be listed as a variation for P3.  Rap with one rope using the bolted stations between Three Pines and Something Interesting.  Note if you're wanting to set up a TR or top belay: the bolted station at the top of P1 doesn't work well for TR or top belaying; they are 20' to the left of the pitch. At the GT, there are giant rocks at the top of the P2 that you can sling for a top belay (and plenty of gear placements available).","{105898385: 4, 107262260: 4, 107551540: 4, 106591608: 4,

Star Action,105803185,Trad,107039700,5.10b,200,2,3.4,103.0,"Star Action was my first first ascent (FFA?). See the comments for my version of the story. It's since become very popular--an easier version of Coexistence just to the left. Dick Williams' recent guides call it 10b. Todd Swain calls it 10+. I have no idea, but it's easier than Coex, and likely harder than 10bs in most climbing areas.  P1: Climb the face and up a thin crack at 5.7 or 5.8, with not much gear, to a horizontal. Protect the second, then traverse left and up to the right edge of the ledge. Most parties will belay here.  P2: Follow a thin crack past a few short, thin horizontal cracks to a ceiling. On the FA, we placed a pin in one of the horizontals and one at the ceiling - I don't know if they are still there. In his latest Trapps Guide (aka the Gray Dick), Dick Williams has the crux nailed: ""Work/dyno up to a jug (physical crux), then move left into the corner (mental crux) ...""  The move over the ceiling was always at the limit of my finger strength for doing it statically. But the move left into the corner was always the crux for me - you have to extend left from the jug, with not much for your feet, to a layback. Transitioning into the layback is spooky. Once you're there, it's easy. There's another way, though. From the jug, if you're strong enough, you can reach straight up to a positive hold and then just step up to stand on the jug.  Above the ceiling, move up and right to a bolt anchor (obviously not there on the FA; in those days, we would traverse left to the Coex pin anchors to bail after P2 of Star Action).  P3: Rarely done; continue up the right-facing corner to a large roof. Roll over the roof at a break, a la beached whale, at 5.9. Todd Swain's guide says this roof had been done previously.  P4: There is apparently an easy pitch leading to the top. In those days, Dick Williams wouldn't put a climb in the guide if it didn't go all the way to the top; hence many routes included less-than-aesthetic upper or bottom pitches just to ensure getting in the next guidebook.","{106403737: 4, 106985791: 4, 106139012: 4, 106411080: 4, 105899248: 4, 10610: 4, 106607660: 4, 106290147: 4, 107246852: 4, 106571266: 4, 106405973: 4, 106246445: 4, 106394111: 4, 107767801: 4, 105892598: 4, 106441937: 4, 107696530: 4, 108082584: 4, 108312115: 4, 106449525: 4, 105851541: 4, 107427822: 4, 110185189: 4, 105898385: 4, 11690: 4, 106897206: 4, 110619029: 4, 107929356: 4, 107574666: 4, 109719701: 4, 109193524: 4, 107142289: 4, 106238291: 4, 200065360: 4, 110315255: 4, 200108528: 4, 108751329: 4, 107186883: 4, 106949749: 4, 107007527: 4, 200067404: 4, 107400819: 4, 112051710: 4, 112192174: 4, 110746025: 4, 200158745: 4, 10271: 3, 106030548: 3, 10168: 3, 106999733: 3, 105824694: 3, 105832216: 3, 107771322: 3, 106325770: 3, 106299993: 3, 106007648: 3, 105889270: 3, 106071787: 3, 106089213: 3, 105811146: 3, 106344939: 3, 106619581: 3, 106151063: 3, 106058125: 3, 106407009: 3, 107178254: 3, 107185927: 3, 106158624: 3, 107768989: 3, 107238223: 3, 107093945: 3, 108529353: 3, 106486112: 3, 109767025: 3, 109465165: 3, 108234518: 3, 108104429: 3, 107356939: 3, 108981414: 3, 111841723: 3, 110148121: 3, 108047997: 3, 105798365: 3, 111796230: 3, 106209804: 3, 111850994: 3, 106646308: 3, 108793472: 3, 107469778: 3, 112846385: 3, 10270: 3, 200120733: 3, 110873869: 3, 107206725: 3, 110689679: 3, 106423391: 2, 108367150: 2, 106001645: 2, 107886100: 2, 110396163: 2, 109638995: 2, 111662106: 2}"

The 2nd pitch tackles a hanging right-facing corner directly over your head. It's steep right off the ledge and if the starting footholds break, you'll land on your belayer. After swinging around left at the top of this corner, you'll be faced with the crux bulge. Above, head up right to find another belay.

P1: This is a link-up from Tough Shift to No Existence. After tackling the crux of Tough Shift at the thin jagged crack and reaching the orange face section, move right to the right-facing corner of No Existence. Continue up easy terrain until you reach a tree with slings for a comfortable hanging belay. 5.10a, 120'.    P2: Right above you is the crux of P2 that requires mandatory jamming on steep overhanging terrain. After a few (desperate) short jamming moves, face holds appear again to exit the overhanging section. This pitch could be sandbagged if you are not used to crack climbing.

Climb up the crack into a right-facing corner system and follow this up to an obvious high point that is about 20' below the roof band. Place some high pro and bust it straight left (crux, long reach) to a good, but committing, hold. Take another deep breath and continue left, and then up into a distinctly orange/white shield of rock. The holds are there, but you definitely don't want to blow it as you're looking at a big pendulum whipper.

Welcome to the Gunks,105799065,Trad,107039700,5.10b,95,1,3.8,157.0,"Welcome to the Gunks is a nice little single-pitch climb that passes through multiple roofs!  Begin below tiered roofs at the center of a low roof with two crack/flake systems which is right of Tequila Mockingbird and Dry Martini. The access trail for Welcome to the Gunks is about an 8-min. walk from the Uberfall, and a 4-min. walk from where the East Trapps Connector Trail meets the carriage road.  The first bit is difficult and scary - unprotected moves on slopers will get you to some decent gear. Above this there is another runout through the second roof, but fortunately the rest of the climb is well-protected.

This route had either no or one stars in the old guidebooks, and wasn't mentioned in the Williams Select guide either. However, with the new ""Gray Dick"", it was awarded three stars - and rightfully so. Great route, protection thin but solid, crux is well-protected with some thought, and there's some very heady, lower-angle face-climbing to end off the pitch. Pitch two, however, is very much not worth doing - overgrown, little protection, and very difficult communication.  P1: Climb the corner - watch for loose blocks - to the roof (crux), angle left, then climb much easier terrain to a belay near the top of Welcome to the Gunks.  P2: Bushwack through tons of shrubbery over uninspiring rock to the very top. Not worth it, IMHO.

Either way, it's a great pitch.

Climb easy rock up to the roof, passing a vertically-placed pin about halfway up the face. Climb through the well-protected roof at a short left-facing corner/flake, and then straight up the overhanging face above on good holds. (Be aware that Blueberry Wine, a 5.11, goes through the roof at a similar looking left-facing corner a few feet to the right of BBB.)  Above the overhanging section is a ledge at which the angle eases and the rock becomes dirtier. To rappel using a single 60, go to a bolted station off to climber's right.  There is a second pitch to the top, of lesser quality and difficulty, which angles up right to a left-facing corner.","{107629487: 4, 106238291: 4, 110232694: 4, 105898385: 4, 200267314: 4, 111738589: 4, 200067404: 4, 200168968: 4, 110548079: 4, 108031666: 4, 200635570: 4, 106741264: 4, 105813053: 3, 105997912: 3, 107663290: 3, 106020371: 3, 106108233: 3, 106347425: 3, 107246852: 3, 106571266: 3, 107178254: 3, 106325770: 3, 107561935: 3, 107119375: 3, 106897206: 3, 107768989: 3, 107273411: 3, 106890022: 3, 105798761: 3, 107268430: 3, 108363423: 3, 106879280: 3, 107493811: 3, 108082584: 3, 106542092: 3, 106344939: 3, 110427480: 3, 107621814: 3, 107400819: 3, 107194267: 3, 110148121: 3, 108981414: 3, 110315255: 3, 109659244: 3, 107142289: 3, 105851541: 3, 107469778: 3, 107032446: 3, 107929356: 3, 110409351: 3, 110999688: 3, 110165451: 3, 111850994: 3, 107226876: 3, 108793472: 3, 109187861: 3, 200108528: 3, 107186883: 3, 106425299: 3, 108101871: 3, 112091216: 3, 111882861: 3, 107886100: 3, 106449525: 3, 112846385: 3, 112042073: 3, 108014881: 3, 112373727: 3, 109142435: 3, 107540375: 3, 108103821: 3, 200145352: 3, 110619029: 3, 108160061: 3, 107529159: 3, 110830564: 3, 200277103: 3, 111696155: 3, 107771322: 2, 107865103: 2, 105892598: 2, 106089213: 2, 106290147: 2, 106405973: 2, 106394111: 2, 10168: 2, 106001645: 2, 106423391: 2, 107093945: 2, 107238223: 2, 108032974: 2, 107185927: 2, 106666369: 2, 109767025: 2, 112181400: 2, 109018466: 2, 111857489: 2, 200599831: 2, 105798365: 2, 200120733: 2, 200169513: 2, 107206725: 2}"
Beginner's Delight,105801001,Trad,107051389,5.4,250,3,3.1,320.0,"My personal favorite at this grade. Often very busy though.  Start left of Minty: from where the trail hits the cliff, walk about 50' left past the thin crack of Snooky's Return to an obvious right-leaning crack.  P1: Either climb the crack (harder) or corners just left to a ledge. Continue up and step right and then up to a good belay (even with the top of Snooky's). 5.3, 75'. It's possible to walk right to the rap anchor there if you need to descend.  P2: Climb up the big corner above. About 40' up, it's easier to work left onto the face instead of staying in the corner. If you find the moves are harder than 5.4 you need to go left. Work left on a ledge system to a right-facing corner - climb up this to a comfy belay on the GT ledge. 5.4, 120'.  P3: Climb up a left-facing corner about 10' to a roof, clip an old pin, and avoid it around to the right. Then up easy ground to another roof - step left at this one (spectacular exposure) and then up to the top. 5.3, 60'.  Rappel from a tree at clifftop; there are bolted anchors at the GT ledge and at mid-cliff, so a single 60m will do.  Be very careful of climbers below, if you rappel, remembering that climbers have the right-of-way.","{106108233: 4, 107542557: 4, 11926: 4, 14407: 4, 106869562: 4, 105829681: 4, 105871391: 4, 106785304: 4, 106022427: 4, 106913581: 4, 105896714: 4, 105927660: 4, 107400819: 4, 107068306: 4, 106030542: 4, 106299993: 4, 106044572: 4, 105859992: 4, 106596992: 4, 106089213: 4, 107663290: 4, 107902567: 4, 107865103: 4, 107919874: 4, 106001645: 4, 105790750: 4, 106087077: 4, 106263368: 4, 106347425: 4, 106132247: 4, 106567319: 4, 106797746: 4, 106942612: 4, 107125052: 4, 107250964: 4, 106971070: 4, 107436921: 4, 107914961: 4, 109136692: 4, 107671020: 4, 107787623: 4, 108200561: 4, 107872722: 4, 107142289: 4, 107931258: 4, 107561935: 4, 109022464: 4, 107629487: 4, 107928271: 4, 107735256: 4, 108311593: 4, 108394904: 4, 109451199: 4, 109405787: 4, 109692317: 4, 108367150: 4, 108524622: 4, 109188030: 4, 107493811: 4, 10246: 4, 107428130: 4, 109990981: 4, 109769521: 4, 111952379: 4, 109542989: 4, 106210225: 4, 108363423: 4, 112292121: 4, 110738873: 4, 111982873: 4, 109701612: 4, 110452119: 4, 112291761: 4, 110592577: 4, 112423730: 4, 112449870: 4, 200085165: 4, 106858324: 4, 109187861: 4, 200192072: 4, 112512800: 4, 110425509: 4, 200154540: 4, 200318680: 4, 200262030: 4, 106532209: 4, 110937405: 4, 200216761: 4, 108793472: 4, 111341867: 4, 105787348: 4, 111974624: 4, 200297969: 4, 200529988: 4, 106173169: 4, 109405478: 4, 112373727: 4, 200171202: 4, 200168968: 4, 200313976: 4, 200856751: 4, 200158745: 4, 200326417: 4, 200159344: 4, 200688012: 4, 111662106: 4, 106953954: 3, 106637423: 3, 106841465: 3, 105808624: 3, 105854062: 3, 106030894: 3, 107518458: 3, 105880131: 3, 105961696: 3, 107093945: 3, 107560092: 3, 107768862: 3, 107438587: 3, 106405973: 3, 105886426: 3, 106098470: 3, 105831725: 3, 107441340: 3, 106477370: 3, 105898385: 3, 106591608: 3, 106803582: 3, 106766740: 3, 106822110: 3, 108985245: 3, 107183263: 3, 106680875: 3, 107068335: 3, 107238223: 3, 106394111: 3, 107723931: 3, 106928886: 3, 107544688: 3, 107464151: 3, 108187975: 3, 107225433: 3, 106102123: 3, 107551540: 3, 108104464: 3, 108298258: 3, 107691094: 3, 107119375: 3, 106630260: 3, 107768989: 3, 109328122: 3, 109359027: 3, 109406002: 3, 108590756: 3, 108968342: 3, 108639907: 3, 108222065: 3, 108805745: 3, 109018466: 3, 109816235: 3, 110359430: 3, 107830036: 3, 107239710: 3, 107563431: 3, 109737113: 3, 108138324: 3, 107246852: 3, 106589007: 3, 110735180: 3, 107097698: 3, 106297607: 3, 109280064: 3, 108907684: 3, 110427770: 3, 110515542: 3, 110330190: 3, 108857846: 3, 106717383: 3, 106560803: 3, 110946269: 3, 107280303: 3, 108305825: 3, 110528436: 3, 111948648: 3, 110190703: 3, 111983604: 3, 107318184: 3, 109193524: 3, 107226876: 3, 109483250: 3, 110631955: 3, 112272041: 3, 108003206: 3, 108369177: 3, 200062311: 3, 200069906: 3, 109146884: 3, 112325249: 3, 200061302: 3, 110488065: 3, 111902978: 3, 111888967: 3, 108155086: 3, 109895944: 3, 108409515: 3, 107241231: 3, 111657384: 3, 112207296: 3, 108895420: 3, 200122335: 3, 200251930: 3, 106578430: 3, 200202705: 3, 110409351: 3, 108375637: 3, 112134112: 3, 107783937: 3, 110196944: 3, 200293863: 3, 200320872: 3, 106209804: 3, 112245330: 3, 106285259: 3, 110968170: 3, 200285165: 3, 200177128: 3, 110619029: 3, 200363508: 3, 108701917: 3, 200227654: 3, 112070348: 3, 108981414: 3, 112050276: 3, 200249886: 3, 108111761: 3, 109057647: 3, 200056611: 3, 200386343: 3, 200177277: 3, 112529638: 3, 200145352: 3, 200067404: 3, 200370966: 3, 200504586: 3, 200224193: 3, 200075195: 3, 200314873: 3, 105832216: 3, 200331350: 3, 200253316: 3, 112042073: 3, 112073495: 3, 200635570: 3, 112924258: 3, 200492491: 3, 200564551: 3, 200463147: 3, 109638995: 3, 108106981: 3, 106656746: 3, 108329997: 3, 200891725: 3, 200639029: 3, 106999733: 2, 106571266: 2, 106020371: 2, 106125724: 2, 106011891: 2, 106430658: 2, 106732573: 2, 106649711: 2, 108082584: 2, 107748535: 2, 107682885: 2, 106824315: 2, 107304112: 2, 107434457: 2, 106449525: 2, 108428307: 2, 108032974: 2, 108540048: 2, 109646398: 2, 107929356: 2, 109393254: 2, 108228481: 2, 108409574: 2, 110148121: 2, 111169936: 2, 110534107: 2, 109581184: 2, 111351508: 2, 110942763: 2, 108121411: 2, 107700110: 2, 200122621: 2, 111850994: 2, 200073149: 2, 200180156: 2, 112136403: 2, 112172937: 2, 111857489: 2, 111777299: 2, 200267314: 2, 106325770: 2, 109142435: 2, 200396867: 2, 112268661: 2, 105886625: 2, 200371228: 2, 112143262: 2, 111496831: 2, 200489777: 2, 106580951: 1, 108268126: 1, 107819171: 1, 107552617: 1, 106554048: 1, 107833965: 1, 111696155: 1}"

You can probably find an easier rap by traversing the GT Ledge in either direction.","{107464151: 3, 106749092: 2, 109193524: 2, 106797746: 2, 107262260: 2, 110998345: 2, 108187975: 2, 107629487: 2, 107142289: 2, 106449525: 2, 200617907: 2, 106089213: 2, 200299483: 2, 13085: 2, 108793472: 2, 107400819: 2, 106299993: 2, 109451199: 2, 106297607: 2, 111307051: 2, 106817494: 2, 107068335: 1, 109102869: 1, 109156548: 1, 106953954: 1, 106822110: 1, 106751248: 1, 106117267: 1, 105832216: 1, 105829522: 1, 106841465: 0, 106637423: 0}"

Use the same access trail as for Minty. This is about a 9-min. walk from the Uberfall, or a 5-min. walk from where the East Trapps Connector Trail meets the carriage road. At the cliff, walk 35' left of Minty to the start of the route.  Start about 15'-20' right of Snooky's Return below some shallow right-facing corners.  P1: Head up into the right-facing corner above. The first crux comes at a weird move near an overlap. Place gear often in this area, since the gear is a little on the shallow and thin side.

Two ropes to the ground, or one rope to another pair of bolts.","{106785304: 4, 106022427: 4, 105832216: 4, 107097681: 4, 106985791: 4, 107400819: 4, 105988971: 4, 106071787: 4, 107322165: 4, 106687445: 4, 106041457: 4, 107902567: 4, 105898385: 4, 106108233: 4, 105813725: 4, 105828100: 4, 106607660: 4, 106290147: 4, 106897206: 4, 106953954: 4, 106953888: 4, 107246852: 4, 106441937: 4, 107561935: 4, 107304112: 4, 107323487: 4, 106102123: 4, 107178254: 4, 107226876: 4, 107574666: 4, 106299993: 4, 108367150: 4, 108082584: 4, 108988764: 4, 107119375: 4, 109767025: 4, 106238291: 4, 108032974: 4, 108363423: 4, 109816235: 4, 108529353: 4, 107621814: 4, 107755397: 4, 106486112: 4, 107663290: 4, 109581184: 4, 108899032: 4, 105834672: 4, 107929356: 4, 111854190: 4, 108478944: 4, 108121411: 4, 107532299: 4, 110148121: 4, 107142289: 4, 105904878: 4, 111928324: 4, 111829790: 4, 107620691: 4, 111777299: 4, 111857489: 4, 109373249: 4, 109187861: 4, 110165451: 4, 200040100: 4, 200267314: 4, 107830036: 4, 109585594: 4, 106209804: 4, 109472534: 4, 112460885: 4, 200158745: 4, 110999688: 4, 112042073: 4, 105889270: 4, 107002528: 4, 200067404: 4, 107886100: 4, 112091216: 4, 112134112: 4, 200146694: 4, 108320835: 4, 200130009: 4, 110337843: 4, 108994382: 4, 109316126: 4, 112373727: 4, 200169394: 4, 200594684: 4, 112104580: 4, 106741264: 4, 200399381: 4, 112192174: 4, 110689679: 4, 109692317: 4, 107206725: 4, 111796230: 4, 106999733: 3, 105788804: 3, 105899248: 3, 10610: 3, 105851541: 3, 107525760: 3, 107771322: 3, 106089213: 3, 107671020: 3, 106207412: 3, 107865103: 3, 106139012: 3, 105892598: 3, 106151063: 3, 11690: 3, 106737343: 3, 106571266: 3, 106347425: 3, 106125724: 3, 106394111: 3, 106344939: 3, 10168: 3, 107696530: 3, 106720416: 3, 107093945: 3, 107185927: 3, 108843325: 3, 107238223: 3, 106449525: 3, 106666369: 3, 108608330: 3, 106325770: 3, 108000881: 3, 109005921: 3, 107417501: 3, 107146835: 3, 107768989: 3, 107240862: 3, 107629487: 3, 109142435: 3, 110619029: 3, 106210225: 3, 108104429: 3, 108981414: 3, 107232016: 3, 107434457: 3, 106879280: 3, 111850994: 3, 108793472: 3, 110409351: 3, 110754837: 3, 111841723: 3, 109018466: 3, 200079884: 3, 110746025: 3, 112050276: 3, 105798365: 3, 200120733: 3, 107801617: 3, 200634307: 3, 107529159: 3, 107533935: 3, 106058125: 2, 106762873: 2, 106405973: 2, 106001645: 2, 109737113: 2, 111999314: 2, 108160061: 2}"
Madame Grunnebaum's Wulst,105799697,Trad,107051389,5.6,210,3,3.7,687.0,"Madame G's rivals High Exposure closely for the title of best Gunks 5.6. While High E has ""the move"", Madame G's has a longer section of sweet, steep 5.6 jugs up a massive, exposed and unique orange buttress formed by large left-facing (Southern Pillar, 5.2) and right-facing (Northern Pillar, 5.4) dihedrals on either side.  P1: Follow the thin crack to the tree. 5.4, 50'.  P2: Traverse right into a steep left-facing dihedral, with jugs and jams. At the top, traverse right and belay on a small stance at a horizontal crack. You'll want some hand-size cams for the belay. 5.6, 80'.  P3: Follow the chalk through multiple overhangs on huge jugs and steep terrain. Near the top, angle right through the final overhang and belay at bolts. 5.6, 80'.  You can combine P1/P2 or P2/P3. The best combination is P2/P3, because you'll skip the semi-hanging belay. Bring lots of long slings - both the climbing and the protection wander.  Descent: Rap twice down the Northern Pillar side of the buttress, from sets of bolts with a single 60m (or one long mostly-free rappel with 2x60m). The top bolts are somewhat hidden: peek around a large boulder on climber's right to find them. From the clifftop and other nearby routes, you'll need to scramble back down to the top of the buttress proper, then look for the bolts.  Pre-bolts, climbers had to rappel from the tree at the corner of the buttress - both getting on rappel, and the free-hanging rappel itself, were rites of passage for newer climbers.","{107518458: 4,

Minty,105800326,Trad,107051389,5.4,250,3,2.9,297.0,"A justly popular beginner's outing. This route is easily located by finding the ""Minty Tree"" - the first significant pine tree on the left side of the carriage road. An access trail leads straight to the climb from this tree. This is about a 9-min. walk from the Uberfall or a 5-min. walk from where the East Trapps Connector Trail meets the carriage road.  P1: Climb a right-facing dihedral to a ledge, then work left and up aiming for a severely leaning pine tree. 5.3, 60'.  P2: Start up a corner and immediately step around left and climb a face past a couple of pins to a ledge with a bent-over pine (optional belay here). From that tree, climb up and take another left onto the face. A hole in a flake indicates where you should step left. Up the face to a pin and then on up (crux) to easier ground and the GT ledge. Belay at a bolted rap anchor. 5.4, 120'.  P3: The usual route climbs an easy crack off the right side of the ledge. 5.2, 50'.  A much more worthwhile finish is the ""Minty Overhang"", rising directly above the belay tree. A pin marks the spot when you pull through. 5.5, 50'.  Descend either by walking far left to the Uberfall, or rappel via bolted rap anchors at GT ledge and below the GT ledge.

Note - I tried this for the first time recently without really reading the guidebook well and accidentally did the 5.6R variation. Someone who has done the standard route can elaborate on that part. I'll list 3 pitches as in the gray dick, though I linked pitches 2&3.  Pitch 1: Scramble up the gully for about 50 feet. Anchor in the gully.  Pitch 2: Angle up and left on good holds towards the first overhang and build a belay. 5.8, 60'.  Pitch 3: Climb the overhang at a crack, then angle left, staying right of the next overhang and left of the third overhang and Le Teton. Exit to the GT Ledge in the same spot as Madame G. 5.7+, 60'.  Variation: There is a ledge off to the left side of the gully about the same level of the start of Madame G's P2 and the ledge used to top rope the guide's wall. From here you can climb the pebbly face at around 5.6R heading towards the first overhang. I angled right towards the arete a little, then back to the left merging with the standard P2.

Reach of Faith,113851850,Trad,107051389,5.10c,210,3,1.0,2.0,"I did this route because Dick Williams gives it a star in his guidebook. I was intrigued, since despite Dick's recommendation no one seems to do it. Though the route is surrounded by classics like Snooky's Return, Hawk, and Madame G's, it remains obscure. No one has added it to Mountain Project (until now), and it isn't even mentioned in the Trapps App.    The 5.10 grade runs so deep at the Gunks that even no-star tens tend to be pretty decent. I figured this route was worth checking out.    Having now done it, my verdict is ""don't bother."" I might return some day just to do pitch three, but if I do that I will approach this pitch by taking Hawk or Southern Pillar to the GT Ledge, thus avoiding the poorly-protected first two pitches of Reach of Faith.    Pitch one (70 feet, 5.4 R). This pitch climbs a low-angled face directly up to an obvious pine tree. The climbing is easy, but there isn't much gear. You may be able to excavate some placements if you clean dirt out of some cracks. I found it helpful to sling a few trees along the way. For me the primary challenge on this pitch was finding clean rock to stand on, as opposed to clumps of grass and pine needles. I combined this pitch with pitch two.    Pitch two (80 feet, 5.8 R). This is one of the scarier pitches of 5.8 I have led. Trend up and right from the pine tree, aiming for a patch of rock that is a lighter color than the surrounding rock. Pro is scarce as you head for this light patch of rock. Once you get there, you will find placements among the features/flakes. Unfortunately the features/flakes ring hollow.    Once you have put in some pro, head up and right just a move or two more and then traverse left for about ten to fifteen feet (crux, no gear). It can be hard to tell where to traverse. I chose to go directly left where I could see a line of hand and foot holds; my partner chose a different solution, going diagonally up and left. Whatever path you choose, be careful not to fall, as you will pendulum onto your gear in those hollow flakes!    After the traverse, the climbing eases through a notch to a pleasant belay ledge with a bush that has some truly comical ancient slings around it. You can build a gear anchor in the wall behind the bush.    Pitch three (60 feet, 5.10c). This pitch is better than the others, though it isn't without drawbacks. Head straight up and a touch to the right for about 20-30 feet to the GT Ledge. Then move left to an obvious tree growing out below a roof with a very thin crack running through it. Sling the tree for pro and then fight with the tree to get over the roof and onto the slab above. (This roof is maybe 5.9? Maybe 5.10a, because of the tree?)    Then move up to a second roof with an obvious diagonal crack running out the underside to the lip. Place some gear in the crack and surmount the roof where the crack meets the lip (crux). This is an exciting roof and there is additional good gear you can place over your head on the face before you commit to moving up.     Once you get over the second roof, scamper to the top of the cliff through a thick forest of lichen.","{107246852: 2, 106519306: 0}"

The good news is that the climbing is continuous and fun. The bad news is that it's directly in a rappel line that is sometimes used by neighboring routes - it's not uncommon for newer parties, with less experience in rappelling and/or etiquette, to send ropes and pebbles down without warning. Or to insist/assume that you will wait to finish your lead until all four of them have passed. But I digress ...  The less-climbed second pitch goes up a shallow left-facing corner above the belay bolts to a rooflet, under which you traverse left. Up a steep face with some reachy moves, then up and right following the path of least resistance to the GT ledge and another bolted anchor.  The quite-less-climbed third pitch, while short, is fun and exciting: on the GT ledge, walk left to the base of a left-facing corner. Climb up the corner underneath the roof, and escape right, continuing on to the cliff top.  Descent: from the clifftop, use a tree anchor to get to the GT ledge, between this route and Minty.

Tetonia,106889345,Trad,107051389,5.10b,180,1,2.8,15.0,"Tetonia has surely been climbed before right? ​​​​​It's just too much of an obvious line! Who hasn't climbed Le Teton and wished the overhanging jugs on the arete were longer? Consider the wish granted!  Tetonia begins wherever you'd like in the gully area left of Northern Pillar. The gully thrash was actually the original historical path of Le Teton. If you feel up to it, I suggest you forgo placing gear as you climb the 5.3ish moves up the face to the right of the gully, and then cross the gully to the dirt ledge about 50 feet up. The real climbing starts here (8 feet climbers' left of the gully), and I'm pretty sure it shares the start and the first 25 feet or so with the direct Mr. P's Wulst in the pebbly face/groove, mentioned in the Grey Dick. From this dirt ledge it is exactly 35 meters to the steel anchors. The protection is a bit R off the ledge, but the climbing is easy and gear can be had about 15 feet up ... er, 65 feet up...  When you reach the point where Mr. P's Wulst trends left onto the left side of the arete and heads for the overhangs on the face right of Madame Grunnebaum's Wulst (beginning about 30 feet up or so), stick to climbing on the right side of the arete. The climb continues about 2 feet right of the arete for the whole journey, until it merges with Le Teton's overhanging, tiered finale up much higher. Le Teton's vertical crack is completely avoided at the top, instead the arete proper is climbed to the left approx. 10 feet. Enjoy the 80 feet or so of pumpy overhanging jugs and edges (and a few little roofs!) all the way to the GT ledge. Anytime loose rock is feared on the arete, just stay slightly right, and your fears will be calmed. The crux is likely encountered whilst cranking off a flawless white 1 pad-crimp between horizontals about 3/4 of the up- where the biggest roof/step exists high on the arete. The crux could just be hanging on to place gear- quite sustained and non-gunkie. The arete proper is used for the climbing for a few moves, but mostly only higher on the second half of the arete. It is possible down low to mid-way to cheat around the left side of the arete and find some stemming hands-free rests, or to climb farther right and stem onto blocks/sit down and rest in the chimney/gully, but doing this is lame, and lowers the grade to 5.9. Climbing the route and cheating left or right is like attempting a 5.10 with training wheels:)  As I mentioned before, It seems likely this climb would have been done before, but nearly 10 years have past now and no one has come forward with info.  Also I can't find it in the guidebooks, and my questioning of some old-timers has been un-fruitful as well. It definitely deserves attention, once you understand it's nuances I feel it's one of the best 5.10's at the Gunks.","{107475857: 4, 108363423: 4, 106449525: 4, 109767025: 3, 112507024: 3, 105892598: 3, 107093945: 3, 108988764: 3, 106762873: 3, 106058125: 3, 107246852: 2, 106325770: 2, 107238223: 2, 106571266: 2, 107865103: 1}"

The second pitch wanders around the face above, and I have never been able to tell exactly where it goes.  I prefer P2 of Triple Bulges.    P1 - Climb up the nice face for 10-15 feet (crux) past a couple horizontals to the obvious crack.  Climb the crack and/or face to the left for a few feet, then finish up the face either to the left or right of the crack.  Rappel from a tree ~15' left.    P2, described by John : From the P1 belay terrace, climb the pebbly face straight up to the next large ledge. Step left about 7 ft. Look up at the short, arcing left facing corner capped by a small overhang. Now you can't possibly get lost. Climb the corner, exit the overhang on thin holds. Trend up and slightly left to the long small overhang with a ring piton (and note the crack in the piton ring). At the piton, climb straight up to the large overhanging ledges. One tricky move at a flake gets you onto the juggy overhangs. Take the path of least resistance, slightly left, through the overhangs on jugs (5.3 G).

Weeping Willie (direct),114597806,Trad,107051389,5.6,110,2,2.5,19.0," Some printed guidebooks list this as a variation on 'Willie's Weep'. The Gunks App has this route as the only climb listed in this area/corner, and it's called 'Weeping Willie'.  It's pleasant climbing combining Gunks thin horizontals (p1) and classic gunks overhanging corners (p2). I found this line moderately fun, including the part where I had to hide in a tiny cave just above the halfway-belay spot to avoid a surprise downpour ... until the water started seeping (weeping?) through the cracks onto us and some of the route. #namesake  You'll want to watch out for some loose rock in the corner of P2. There were a few, and in particular, one that is slightly larger than a microwave looks like a good handhold but could easily be pulled right off onto your belayer.  P1 – Start near the corner below a slab leading to a right-facing corner above (p2). Clamber up to a ~5’ ledge. Move up and right, and then back left, following the easier terrain and forming a sort-of large gentle arc ending at a small belay stance just below the large right facing corner.  P2 – Move up into the corner. Layback and stem up the low overhanging corner crack (crux), or use some face holds out left (easier but less protected). Continue up slightly easier terrain in the corner until the corner moves right and it seems logical to step around left onto the face. Continue up the face and trend right towards a slung pine tree.  70m rope required to rap from p2.","{108699778: 3, 109020715: 3, 108225547: 3, 200270759: 3, 106554217: 3, 107783937: 3, 107540375: 3, 107318184: 3, 200929612: 3, 112924258: 3, 200228539: 2, 111546553: 2, 109018466: 2, 108981414: 2, 107629487: 2, 112423730: 2, 110590584: 2, 109451199: 2, 109692317: 2}"

We never got to the weepy part (actually, we never really wanted to do the route after downclimbing and rapping it to get off Triple Bulges), which is after the nice rappel at the top of P2.  P1 - Climb a short left-facing corner to a stance, then move up and right to a short, wide horizontal at about 50 feet. Diagonal left to another horizontal and move still farther left to the large, obvious corner with some broken rock. Traverse left past some loose rock (scary for 5.2) to the belay tree/ledge for Twin Oaks.  P2 - Williams describes a second pitch that seems awfully close to Triple Bulges, perhaps a bit right, without the final bulges. I tried to follow it but kept ending up actually on Triple Bulges.  P3 - Avoid. From the belay tree, climb the seepy, broken 15-foot high corner to climber's left, then move left and up the grassy, easy face to the top.

Even though the gear is not perfect, and you may be cleaning piles of pine needles from the holds, there is some fun climbing to be had on this one.  Pitch 1: Climb a bulge just left of the Middle Earth crack. Head straight up, aiming for a small left arching/facing corner. Gain jugs at the top of this little corner and traverse right to a break in the little overhang. Pass a little tree on the right, and when you reach the ledge you can step right to the Middle Earth bolted station. This pitch is 5.7 and makes a fun climb in itself.  Pitch 2: As for Middle Earth; ~80 feet of easy low angle ledges and horizontals up to the Grand Traverse ledge.  Pitch 3: Start a little right of the last pitch Wisecrack. Work up a poorly protected face to the overhang. Pass the overhang at a little right-facing corner (mid way between where Wisecrack and Bombs Away Dream Baby cross the overhang) and up to the top.","{106841465: 3, 108409574: 3, 106449525: 2, 109193524: 2, 111656243: 2, 107093945: 2, 106344939: 2, 107629487: 2, 106108233: 2, 107246852: 2, 106022427: 2, 106299993: 2, 106822110: 2, 110619029: 2, 106394111: 1, 106089213: 1, 106087077: 1}"

Once you ascend the initial slab and reach the obvious, prominent left-facing corner, place bomber gear and commit to launching yourself up and around the corner. This is the 5.9+ crux and when you finish the move your gear will be at your feet.  Now you will be standing against a blank slab. There is a junky fixed pin up over your head and-- if you are tall enough-- you can clip it from the stance. If you are short like me (5' 6"") you will have to make another thin move (crux number 2) to reach the pin, and there is good pro just above.  Climb up to the roof and figure out how to move up and right to get over it (crux number 3). Again your gear is below your feet as you escape the roof.  After the roof it is easy climbing up the slab and slightly left to the V-3 bolt anchor.  This climb is ""just a variation"" but it packs three interesting cruxes into its short duration. It is somewhat spicy, with no overhead pro for any of the cruxes.

Far above you, things are quite unstable.    The rock below the GT is a 30'x10' plaque of loose blocks. Combined with an evolving anchor situation, these loose blocks make for substantial rockfall danger at the base of the cliff. For detailed explanation, see Mike Rawdon's comment below.    2016: There is no anchor (and no good trees, no place for gear) at the GT ledge, aside from a dead, levered-out tree. If you climb above the first pitch, plan on going to the top very, very carefully and rappelling with two ropes back to the first pitch, skipping the GT ledge. Or head north to Arrow to descend.    2017: The hangers and chains have been removed from the bolts at the top of the 3rd pitch. The fixed anchor has been removed from the big pine on the GT.    Note that volunteers are doing this work, and it can take time and not always be perfect...    A deservedly popular climb with good first and third pitches.  P1: Climb broken cracks for about 100', aiming for a nice ledge about 15' left of a large pine tree. The route wanders left and right at various places, so keep looking around. At a big ledge, rappel from a bolted station (almost exactly 30m). 5.6.  P2: Climb easy ground 60' up and slightly left, to the GT Ledge.  P3: Reposition the belay ~ 20 feet to the right. Climb up and left into a right-facing corner (crux).

Walking a bit north to the Arrow rappel line is also an option.","{105896714: 4, 106299993: 4, 106263368: 4, 107097681: 4, 106580951: 4, 105790750: 4, 107134320: 4, 106947610: 4, 106022427: 4, 108050665: 4, 106993942: 4, 109037301: 4, 107379236: 4, 108985245: 4, 108311593: 4, 107277941: 4, 107246852: 4, 106886632: 4, 110536657: 4, 108157281: 4, 106398706: 4, 109581184: 4, 111810563: 4, 110270698: 4, 111289156: 4, 111955057: 4, 107464151: 4, 200352097: 4, 108329997: 4, 200224193: 4, 200819007: 4, 106342472: 4, 106874511: 3, 105813053: 3, 106999733: 3, 107525760: 3, 107322165: 3, 107618553: 3, 105884346: 3, 106555971: 3, 107635248: 3, 12448: 3, 107068306: 3, 107191189: 3, 107587392: 3, 105880131: 3, 106089213: 3, 106098470: 3, 107625137: 3, 106001645: 3, 107902567: 3, 105899248: 3, 106204631: 3, 105804842: 3, 106407009: 3, 106108233: 3, 106087077: 3, 105889415: 3, 106347425: 3, 106456515: 3, 106749092: 3, 106740160: 3, 106290147: 3, 106841465: 3, 106737343: 3, 106855118: 3, 105885105: 3, 106344939: 3, 106822110: 3, 107138953: 3, 106596992: 3, 106571266: 3, 107238223: 3, 107232016: 3, 107125052: 3, 107273411: 3, 107093945: 3, 107663290: 3, 108187975: 3, 107304112: 3, 107551540: 3, 106953954: 3, 107787623: 3, 107629487: 3, 107185927: 3, 106589007: 3, 106238291: 3, 107723931: 3, 106529846: 3, 106146571: 3, 106449525: 3, 108298258: 3, 106928959: 3, 108182872: 3, 109359027: 3, 108590756: 3, 107735256: 3, 106892600: 3, 107142289: 3, 110359430: 3, 108189638: 3, 110427770: 3, 106978809: 3, 109142435: 3, 110613292: 3, 109193524: 3, 110735180: 3, 109585728: 3, 110148121: 3, 106741264: 3, 108507566: 3, 107830036: 3, 107146835: 3, 106897206: 3, 108324210: 3, 109175987: 3, 107068335: 3, 109732582: 3, 108409574: 3, 108367150: 3, 108310475: 3, 107768989: 3, 107776832: 3, 108394904: 3, 108857846: 3, 109018466: 3, 107226876: 3, 108159116: 3, 109180284: 3, 110619029: 3, 111861617: 3, 111656243: 3, 109136692: 3, 107174265: 3, 106717383: 3, 111968804: 3, 107544688: 3, 111919008: 3, 107929356: 3, 109990981: 3, 109542989: 3, 111952379: 3, 111045477: 3, 112272041: 3, 108463947: 3, 112412061: 3, 109513381: 3, 112521413: 3, 111811598: 3, 107569651: 3, 200069906: 3, 111857489: 3, 112546186: 3, 109437284: 3, 200085165: 3, 107412430: 3, 112343811: 3, 111308179: 3, 107783937: 3, 107417154: 3, 106778424: 3, 111546553: 3, 111999314: 3, 200196315: 3, 112042073: 3, 111917976: 3, 107615220: 3, 200267314: 3, 108793472: 3, 200468575: 3, 111203516: 3, 107469778: 3, 109451199: 3, 109057647: 3, 112070348: 3, 106858324: 3, 200492491: 3, 112176219: 3, 105886625: 3, 108699778: 3, 112086258: 3, 105832216: 3, 112373727: 3, 108994382: 3, 13364: 3, 200297969: 3, 105898385: 3, 200034945: 3, 200267777: 3, 107691094: 3, 109414386: 3, 106132247: 2, 107093082: 2, 107592563: 2, 106394111: 2, 107493811: 2, 105795015: 2, 105961696: 2, 105859992: 2, 106117267: 2, 107548455: 2, 105811146: 2, 106205646: 2, 106125724: 2, 106817494: 2, 106762873: 2, 106864388: 2, 105851541: 2, 13658: 2, 106637423: 2, 107052200: 2, 107518458: 2, 108141805: 2, 107671020: 2, 106586290: 2, 108099571: 2, 107748535: 2, 107620610: 2, 107914961: 2, 108363423: 2, 107178254: 2, 109340308: 2, 108222065: 2, 109632996: 2, 107928271: 2, 110391323: 2, 106107825: 2, 110807699: 2, 108008683: 2, 110901677: 2, 110409351: 2, 108052600: 2, 107400819: 2, 111169936: 2, 112037097: 2, 107499312: 2, 111850994: 2, 109102869: 2, 110839245: 2, 108543998: 2, 108121411: 2, 106210225: 2, 110315426: 2, 106209804: 2, 108981414: 2, 200177277: 2, 109411750: 2, 200169513: 2, 107560545: 2, 109316126: 2, 200067404: 2, 112129540: 2, 200609205: 2, 200120733: 2, 200208380: 2, 112924258: 2, 111538784: 2, 107346586: 2, 107620691: 1, 109692317: 1, 108199472: 1, 109052547: 0}"

There are a couple fixed pieces of gear, but the majority of the gear is trad.  The Never Never Land access trail is about a 12-min. walk from the Uberfall, or an 8-min. walk from where the East Trapps Connector Trail meets the carriage road.  Start 30' left of Absurdland at the low point of the cliff, at a polished face with a bolt 25' up.  P1: Place a small piece in the horizontal, or have a spotter. Follow the seam with thin gear supplemented by one fixed piton. Continue on thin face climbing, which is sometimes reachy. The original route goes right, but the straight-up version is recommended and goes at about the same difficulty. An exciting lead for 5.10a!

It's also easy to walk just a bit north (right) to the bolted rappel line at Arrow.","{107559594: 4, 107246852: 4, 10762: 4, 105888111: 4, 105886426: 4, 107217526: 4, 105846944: 4, 107400819: 4, 106299993: 4, 105899248: 4, 107902567: 4, 106204631: 4, 106493776: 4, 106108233: 4, 106549589: 4, 105885105: 4, 106803582: 4, 106503119: 4, 107232016: 4, 107825406: 4, 107678965: 4, 107658399: 4, 107304112: 4, 106423391: 4, 107518458: 4, 107574666: 4, 108363423: 4, 107748535: 4, 109646398: 4, 109816235: 4, 107119375: 4, 109451199: 4, 108394904: 4, 111169936: 4, 108857846: 4, 108321835: 4, 108305825: 4, 108082584: 4, 107549114: 4, 109877052: 4, 111045477: 4, 107544688: 4, 110409351: 4, 200054289: 4, 112343811: 4, 200067404: 4, 112823201: 4, 13364: 4, 200120733: 4, 200492970: 4, 107142289: 4, 111696155: 4, 106325770: 3, 107524273: 3, 107583198: 3, 106874511: 3, 106999733: 3, 106454429: 3, 12371: 3, 107771322: 3, 106089213: 3, 106347425: 3, 107625137: 3, 106407009: 3, 106394053: 3, 106762873: 3, 106263368: 3, 13658: 3, 106958111: 3, 106591608: 3, 107238223: 3, 106571266: 3, 106087077: 3, 106596992: 3, 107273411: 3, 106132247: 3, 107548455: 3, 107093945: 3, 105891309: 3, 106953954: 3, 106993942: 3, 106001645: 3, 106963929: 3, 106102123: 3, 107671020: 3, 106785304: 3, 108104429: 3, 107226876: 3, 108367150: 3, 106589007: 3, 107629487: 3, 106146571: 3, 107178254: 3, 108187975: 3, 106649917: 3, 107553094: 3, 107928271: 3, 108159370: 3, 107561935: 3, 107768989: 3, 108988764: 3, 106398706: 3, 107146835: 3, 109142435: 3, 106405973: 3, 111117552: 3, 105851541: 3, 106210225: 3, 111842420: 3, 108324210: 3, 109193524: 3, 111281190: 3, 111307007: 3, 110839245: 3, 111289156: 3, 108463947: 3, 108121411: 3, 107032446: 3, 110619029: 3, 111850994: 3, 11690: 3, 109437284: 3, 109281879: 3, 109737113: 3, 107412430: 3, 110534118: 3, 106920912: 3, 110758970: 3, 200122520: 3, 108478944: 3, 106985791: 3, 108793472: 3, 108103821: 3, 200281409: 3, 112846385: 3, 112176219: 3, 200224193: 3, 108310475: 3, 200158745: 3, 200034945: 3, 200929612: 3, 110425509: 3, 108329997: 3, 107206725: 3, 111857489: 3, 107519230: 2, 106822110: 2, 106403737: 2, 106394111: 2, 107618553: 2, 106441937: 2, 106290147: 2, 106205646: 2, 106335624: 2, 105842979: 2, 105832216: 2, 106817494: 2, 106841465: 2, 106904560: 2, 105889415: 2, 106897206: 2, 107052200: 2, 107743165: 2, 106719962: 2, 106344939: 2, 108409574: 2, 107587392: 2, 107620691: 2, 109018466: 2, 112037097: 2, 106529846: 2, 107932282: 2, 111841723: 2, 106858324: 2, 111308179: 2, 200145837: 2, 200208380: 2, 107185927: 1}"

Turdland,105799187,Trad,107051512,5.9,100,1,2.5,29.0,"Turdland is a great face climb just left of Never Never Land.  It begins on a large pillar of rock that separates the Never Never Land area from climbs like Balrog and Commando Rave.    Curiously, the book rates it at 5.10d, but it seems highly contrived to do this route at that grade - the natural course will take you up much easier rock - even still the wall is steep and the climbing (and protection) is continuously interesting.  A few bolts protect the upper face.","{106897206: 3, 110619029: 3, 108463947: 3, 107240862: 3, 106503119: 3, 109018466: 3, 11690: 3, 106062921: 3, 106299993: 3, 106117267: 3, 106089213: 3, 107400819: 3, 111308179: 3, 107246852: 3, 13364: 3, 110998345: 2, 106920912: 2, 10168: 2, 110185189: 2, 105888111: 2, 106325770: 2, 105892598: 2, 106405973: 2, 106637976: 2, 106394111: 2, 107803888: 2, 106841465: 2, 200337119: 2, 107178254: 1}"
V-3,105799785,Trad,107051512,5.7,250,3,3.2,317.0,"Another classic Gunks 5.7 pitch, sustained and interesting.  At the cliff, look for a crack directly below a large V-shaped notch at the right end of a roof band.  P1 (5.7, 80'): Start just right of a boulder leaning against the cliff. Climb the cracks and corners, aiming for the exposed V-notch. Continue up a flared chimney to a 2-bolt anchor.  P2 (5.1, 120'): This pitch is easy but fun. There is a right facing corner system above the bolted anchor. Follow this system straight up to the GT Ledge. It is a long pitch. At some point in the middle you naturally step to the right of the corner. There is some hollow rock here, easily avoided, and then you step back left and continue. I also remember having to push past a bush at some point but overall the pitch is clean enough and the rock is good. Just before the GT Ledge the rock is cleaner if you move left and up to the ledge.  P3 ( 5.8, 30'): A short pitch with an entertaining roof. There is a blocky corner system to your left which arches up to a roof. Move just a few steps to your left and head up the face, meeting the corner system just a couple of feet below the roof. There is good gear at the top of the corner and in a downward-facing slot in the underside of the ceiling. Pull over the roof just to the left of this slot-- as soon as you pull into the roof there is another horizontal for gear and jugs to get you over. Once you are over the roof, the pitch is done. Combining pitches two and three is reasonable and the drag was nonexistent until I got over the roof-- and then it was all over and done anyway.  Descent: From the top, you'll need to do the easy scramble up the slab to the true top of the cliff and then go north to the Arrow rap line, where there's an easy step-down just past the bolts.  Or you can go south to the Madame G rappel, where you need to know landmarks, as you'll need to descend a bit to the bolts at the front of the buttress.","{105870772: 4, 106971070: 4, 107228100: 4, 106999733: 4, 105829522: 4, 105896714: 4, 106403737: 4, 107273411: 4, 107730254: 4, 107068335: 4, 106117267: 4, 107621295: 4, 107651072: 4, 107629487: 4, 105811146: 4, 106197143: 4, 106087077: 4, 106108233: 4, 105892598: 4, 106493776: 4, 105842979: 4, 106001645: 4, 106737343: 4, 106773591: 4, 106301735: 4, 106841465: 4, 106405973: 4, 106717690: 4, 106503119: 4, 106822110: 4, 106486112: 4, 106347425: 4, 106022427: 4, 107119375: 4, 107304112: 4, 107217526: 4, 108073727: 4, 107723931: 4, 106797746: 4, 108141805: 4, 108308018: 4, 105886625: 4, 107246852: 4, 108363423: 4, 109094525: 4, 107914961: 4, 107561935: 4, 109193524: 4, 110359430: 4, 106398706: 4, 107745631: 4, 110877362: 4, 111021106: 4, 111169936: 4, 108857846: 4, 107830036: 4, 107536174: 4, 111955057: 4, 107574666: 4, 108478944: 4, 108100269: 4, 106928959: 4, 106026217: 4, 108329997: 4, 109483250: 4, 108985245: 4, 109437284: 4, 200146484: 4, 108294441: 4, 110592577: 4, 200187164: 4, 110330190: 4, 110144057: 4, 109542989: 4, 112449870: 4, 112143262: 4, 200111570: 4, 111796230: 4, 108994382: 4, 200145837: 4, 200617907: 4, 112373727: 4, 200636648: 4, 111538784: 4, 200936538: 4, 109411206: 4, 105898385: 4, 10762: 3, 105795015: 3, 105813053: 3, 107559594: 3, 106726952: 3, 12448: 3, 107134320: 3, 107646553: 3, 107475857: 3, 107658264: 3, 106736701: 3, 105880131: 3, 105961696: 3, 107771322: 3, 105846730: 3, 106596992: 3, 106089213: 3, 107663290: 3, 106299993: 3, 107093945: 3, 105899248: 3, 106191837: 3, 106207412: 3, 106204631: 3, 105846944: 3, 106290147: 3, 106394053: 3, 105787518: 3, 108307042: 3, 106407009: 3, 106785304: 3, 106810849: 3, 106749092: 3, 106904560: 3, 106263368: 3, 106864388: 3, 106205646: 3, 106803582: 3, 13658: 3, 107125052: 3, 106953954: 3, 106214584: 3, 107238223: 3, 106897206: 3, 106748471: 3, 106933730: 3, 107088550: 3, 106874511: 3, 106394111: 3, 107431656: 3, 108095462: 3, 107272204: 3, 108082584: 3, 107691094: 3, 107323239: 3, 107518458: 3, 108219630: 3, 108247898: 3, 108020482: 3, 107278005: 3, 107178254: 3, 107620610: 3, 107748535: 3, 106360234: 3, 107226876: 3, 107872722: 3, 107434457: 3, 106589007: 3, 106993942: 3, 107254662: 3, 106238291: 3, 108156518: 3, 106666369: 3, 108982544: 3, 108823422: 3, 108367150: 3, 106580951: 3, 108187975: 3, 107262260: 3, 107928271: 3, 109498955: 3, 106879280: 3, 108590756: 3, 109563509: 3, 107142289: 3, 107194267: 3, 107417501: 3, 107417154: 3, 108394904: 3, 107493811: 3, 108409574: 3, 107587392: 3, 107379236: 3, 109142435: 3, 107768989: 3, 105859360: 3, 109018466: 3, 106741264: 3, 105924373: 3, 108321835: 3, 107464151: 3, 107146835: 3, 108805745: 3, 107232016: 3, 109451199: 3, 110619029: 3, 108256477: 3, 109136692: 3, 110494556: 3, 111919008: 3, 110462006: 3, 110370905: 3, 112037097: 3, 108201055: 3, 107929356: 3, 110870686: 3, 110321043: 3, 111850994: 3, 112097800: 3, 110396163: 3, 112412061: 3, 107932282: 3, 109586477: 3, 109465165: 3, 111829790: 3, 111857489: 3, 110315255: 3, 110253489: 3, 109692317: 3, 107755397: 3, 106210225: 3, 111289156: 3, 110409351: 3, 107355157: 3, 111657384: 3, 110337843: 3, 200059743: 3, 109187861: 3, 110165451: 3, 110999688: 3, 200072916: 3, 200041551: 3, 200123489: 3, 106209804: 3, 106858324: 3, 107886100: 3, 200314438: 3, 106985791: 3, 108103821: 3, 109316126: 3, 108405147: 3, 106325770: 3, 112091216: 3, 107469778: 3, 111308179: 3, 111878504: 3, 111777299: 3, 106571266: 3, 107412430: 3, 112042073: 3, 200532195: 3, 200249886: 3, 200235631: 3, 112129540: 3, 200371713: 3, 112846385: 3, 200224193: 3, 200345231: 3, 111696155: 3, 112823201: 3, 109869056: 3, 109207991: 3, 111882861: 3, 200113321: 3, 200067404: 3, 13364: 3, 200120733: 3, 110452119: 3, 105851541: 3, 110548079: 3, 200158745: 3, 106554217: 3, 107540375: 3, 200297969: 3, 200635570: 3, 200350797: 3, 200034945: 3, 200804484: 3, 112924258: 3, 109414386: 3, 107206725: 3, 107346586: 3, 106125724: 2, 107519230: 2, 107618553: 2, 107658399: 2, 105798761: 2, 106095805: 2, 106441937: 2, 107400819: 2, 107372532: 2, 106344939: 2, 105832216: 2, 106817494: 2, 107548455: 2, 107240862: 2, 107787623: 2, 107217151: 2, 108099571: 2, 107293598: 2, 107553094: 2, 108401191: 2, 109897147: 2, 110866897: 2, 110232694: 2, 111781359: 2, 106107825: 2, 111841723: 2, 107569651: 2, 111974624: 2, 109144070: 2, 107545559: 2, 108793472: 2, 108981414: 2, 110830564: 2, 111921737: 2, 107185927: 1, 106449525: 1}"

More climbing can be had by beginning at the rightmost edge of the cliff bottom, as described in Gory Thumb. Most people TR P1 after leading Raunchy. P2 is rarely climbed, but is worth doing if you're comfy on Gunks 5.10.

P1 - (5.8 PG) Begin on the blank face as for Raunchy and climb up to the ledge and tree at 10 feet (or go up and left to access the ledge and traverse right to the right edge). Alternatively, start from the right-facing corner below (Gory Thumb) up to the same ledge.  From the right edge of the ledge, go up and right to an obvious thin crack in the middle of the nice white face. Climb the crack (small wires) and continue up the face getting any gear possible to a ledge below a pebbly face. Climb the face using the exposed pebbles, making cool pinch moves, up to a large ledge. Traverse left to the belay bolts.  P2 - Climb the face to a bolt, then up a left- facing corner.

From Optimistic: You know how people say about some climbs, ""this is a great route for someone just breaking into the grade?"" Well, this is a great route for someone just breaking OUT of the grade.  P1 - Climb the obvious left-facing flake and crack system, heading for the overhang at a notch above an alcove. Surmount the overhang (some layback, some jam), then continue up the crack and face.  P2 - Scamper up easy (but loose and vegetated) ground to the GT ledge.  P1 and P2 can be combined into a long 60m pitch. If you're only climbing P1, you'll want to either set a belay or a good directional, then aim rightwards towards the bolted anchor on Middle Earth.  P3 (description courtesy of Brian) - Start below the huge right-facing corner capped by a roof, well left of the good ledge. Make a bouldery move up onto the face, head up into the corner and eventually out left around the arete, and pass several easy overhangs on your way to the clifftop.

P2 - (Note this is not P2 as described in the guidebook, it's P2 for Middle Earth) Climb the low-angle face directly up from the Middle Earth belay tree to the GT ledge and an aging pine. Be careful here - the pine is almost dead and not a good anchor.  P3 - There are three pitches of climbing from the GT ledge. From left to right, the biggest right-facing corner that starts ~25' left is Wisecrack (5.6+). The next right-facing corner, almost directly above the olde rap tree, is Bombs Away Dream Baby (5.8); it is the steepest of the three.

It's also easy to walk just a bit north (right) to the bolted rappel line at Arrow.","{107629487: 4, 106749092: 3, 106263368: 3, 108409574: 3, 107125052: 3, 108363423: 3, 106087077: 3, 106741264: 3, 107615220: 3, 108394904: 3, 106999733: 3, 107525760: 3, 13364: 3, 106299993: 3, 106542092: 3, 107638654: 2, 106398706: 2, 107246852: 2, 108367150: 2, 107548455: 2, 109816235: 2, 108032974: 2, 109102869: 2, 107540375: 2, 109142435: 2, 106571266: 2, 108103821: 2, 108793472: 2, 109451199: 2, 109193524: 2, 110494556: 2, 106405973: 2, 108463947: 2, 105904878: 2, 10294: 2, 110534107: 2, 200350797: 2, 106817494: 2, 106555971: 2, 106407009: 2, 106596992: 2, 106841465: 2, 106062921: 2, 105832216: 2, 106001645: 2, 105851541: 2, 106108233: 2, 107238223: 2, 106022427: 2, 106719962: 2, 107583198: 2, 106394111: 2, 107651072: 2, 107518458: 2, 107663290: 2, 107093945: 2, 106687445: 2, 106933730: 2, 106089213: 2, 109018466: 1, 105811146: 1, 107400819: 1, 108104429: 1, 106822110: 1, 106214584: 1, 108310475: 1, 13658: 1, 107185927: 1, 106117267: 1, 106290147: 1, 107678965: 0}"

Annie Oh!,105801570,Trad,107058090,5.8+,220,2,3.4,236.0,"Another classic route on a great section of the cliff.  The first pitch of Annie Oh! is a bit runout; the second pitch is mega-classic, steep, exciting face.  People often skip the first pitch of Annie Oh!, climbing the first pitch of Three Doves, Limelight, or Arrow to the GT Ledge, and then climbing the second pitch of Annie Oh! from there. Done this way, the route becomes a four-star classic.  The Annie Oh! access trail is just past some white rocks on the left side of the carriage road, at an open area with a good view of the valley. This is about a 13-min. walk from the Uberfall, and a 9-min. walk from where the East Trapps Connector Trail meets the carriage road.  At the cliff, spot a huge left-facing corner on the right; this is Easy Verschneidung (Easy V). Annie Oh! starts about 60' left of Easy V and 20' left of Limelight. This is about 15' right of a large block leaning against the wall (Three Doves).  P1: Climb 40' up a runout slab (5.4 R) to a left-facing corner capped by a small overhang. Turn the overhang, continue up past the right side of a scary block, and angle back left past dirty ledges to the obvious ledge. Belay at any of several big trees. 5.8, 100'.  P1 (variations): Climb the first pitch of Three Doves, Limelight, or Arrow to get to the same ledge. (Recommended).  P2: Start by scrambling up some left-facing flakes. The wall steepens here and the climbing gets harder. Climb up the face, following the path of least resistance, traversing right under a shallow overhang, where the scary loose block discussed below used to be (it fell in Nov. 2012). Continue up the bright white face above, with several thin 5.8 moves. At the final roof, either exit right onto Limelight, or move left to a groove near the top of the wall.

There are also other classic moderates in the same area (Three Doves, Annie Oh!, and Limelight).  A bit of discussion on the history of Arrow hereAt the cliff, spot the huge left-facing corner of Easy Verschneidung (Easy V) on the right; scramble up on ledges about 20' left of Easy V to start.P1: Follow face and crack systems up and slightly left to a bolted belay at the ledge system under a roof. A bit runout towards the top. 5.6, 100'.P2: Angle left through the notch in the roof. After a few hard tugs, you'll be below a beautiful white slab. Follow this slab, passing 2 bolts on the way to a final headwall. The crux reach is protected by a final bolt. 5.8, 100'. Bolts on this pitch were replaced in 2015 (see comment).Rap twice with a single 60M rope from bolt anchors at the GT ledge and mid-cliff ledge.","{106822110: 4, 106680875: 4, 106403737: 4, 107107763:

Cascading Crystal Kaleidoscope (CCK),105801065,Trad,107058090,5.8,250,3,3.7,497.0,"CCK is another Gunks ultra-classic.  The exposed, exciting third pitch is one of the most memorable you'll ever do at the grade.    P1: Climb the short corner and angle up right (var) to a left-facing corner.  Climb the corner to a roof,  then move left and climb a crack to the GT Ledge.  Belay at a big oak tree with rap slings.  5.6 PG, 120'.   var: Rather than moving right to the corner, climb straight up the face. Gear in horizontals provide good pro, and there are very fun technical face moves to be done. At the end of the face you step right and then ascend the final crack that takes you to the GT ledge. 5.7/8 G    You can also climb the enjoyable first 5.8 pitch of Erect Direction, a crack system on the left wall of Updraft, to get to the GT ledge.   There are several options for the second pitch, with varying degrees of difficulty and protection.    P2, option 1: Take the Updraft corner to a belay ledge in the corner. Safe at PG and easy at < 5.5.      P2, option 2: From the oak tree rap/belay station, walk climber's right on the GT for about 20' to a pine tree.  Climb past a short left-facing corner, with a thin crack to a stance at the overhang. Step right and climb past bulging rock (crux) to a stance. From here, diagonal up left to the belay ledge.  This way is what Williams describes; you circumvent the crux overhang/notch of the third choice below, starting to the right and traversing left when you're above it. 5.7+ PG-R    P2, option 3: From the oak tree rap/belay station, climb straight up the rock directly behind the tree until it's obvious to traverse right under the overhang.  Traverse either high or low (awkward either way) about 8' right, make a difficult mantle past a bulge, then trend left up to the belay.  Protecting the second is difficult to do well here. This is the start of CCK Direct's second pitch, at 5.8+ PG-R.     Note: CCK Direct (5.9) continues straight up above the left-facing flakes and exits left out the roof.    P3, the money pitch: Make sure the belayer has a camera; this is one of the best photo-ops in the Gunks!  Step down and make an exposed traverse to the right on small edges.  Move up to a pin and make a big step right to a vertical flake and hand crack.  Layback and jam up to a roof (crux), clip another fixed pin, and traverse right under the roof to a big ledge.  5.7+, 50'.    Descent: Walk right about 100' to a notch, and scramble down the notch to the bolted rappel route by The Last Will Be First.  3 rappels with one rope get you back down.  Alternatively, head south: three rappels from bolted anchors over No Glow will get you to the ground with a single rope.","{107475857: 4, 106403737: 4, 10762: 4, 105813053: 4, 106999733: 4, 105821045:

CCK Direct,105801940,Trad,107058090,5.9,240,2,3.8,200.0,"CCK Direct is such a classic line that Williams lists it as a separate climb in his Trapps guidebook, so we'll list it separately here too.    P1: Climb the short corner and angle up right to a left-facing corner.  Climb the corner to a roof,  then move left and climb a crack to the GT Ledge.  Belay at a big oak tree with rap slings.  5.6, 120'.    Alternatively, climb the first pitch of Erect Direction, a crack system on the left wall of Updraft, and traverse right to the oak tree.  5.8, 120'.    P2:  Climb up directly behind the oak tree to a ledge and roof. Get pro in a horizontal, traverse right (either high or low), and make a tough mantle move past the overhang to a stance (5.8 PG-R). Climb up left-facing flakes, and continue straight up through tiered overhangs (small cams, some reachy moves) to the CCK crack. Follow the crack to the small roof at the top.  When you see the pin leading right, go straight up over a small bulge to an alcove beneath the roof. From here, work left about 10' to the edge of the roof and go up a short handcrack (crux) to the top for a spectacular finish. 5.9 PG-R, 120'.    Descent: Walk right about 100' to a notch. Walk down the notch to a bolted rappel route by The Last Will Be First. 3 rappels with one rope get you back down. Alternatively, head south: three rappels from bolted anchors over No Glow will get you to the ground with a single rope.","{106030548: 4, 106403737: 4, 10762: 4, 107174265: 4, 106785304: 4, 105832216: 4, 12371: 4, 106942628: 4, 106095805: 4, 105880131: 4, 105883574: 4, 107771322: 4, 106441937: 4, 107400819: 4, 105886712: 4, 107246852: 4, 106146571: 4, 107561935: 4, 105859992: 4, 106071787: 4, 107093945: 4, 106897206: 4, 106299993: 4, 107678965: 4, 106866450: 4, 105083738: 4, 106041457: 4, 107902567: 4, 106430712: 4, 107865103: 4, 105961696: 4, 106246445: 4, 105898385: 4, 105892598: 4, 106290147: 4, 106151063: 4, 106591608: 4, 105899901: 4, 106762873: 4, 11690: 4, 106405973: 4, 106588555: 4, 105828100: 4, 105851541: 4, 107002071: 4, 106125724: 4, 106571266: 4, 106748471: 4, 107030540: 4, 106503119: 4, 107356939: 4, 108104464: 4, 106687445: 4, 107185927: 4, 106423391: 4, 105812440: 4, 105891309: 4, 106238291: 4, 106666369: 4, 106486112: 4, 107026497: 4, 107178254: 4, 108996063: 4, 106901183: 4, 107767801: 4, 107718501: 4, 107238223: 4, 108367150: 4, 109143868: 4, 107572777: 4, 108082584: 4, 108363423: 4, 106542092: 4, 107660333: 4, 106879280: 4, 107574666: 4, 109005921: 4, 108726865: 4, 107663290: 4, 107232016: 4, 107240862: 4, 106394111: 4, 107629487: 4, 107928271: 4, 108495695: 4, 106736701: 4, 109281879: 4, 109411206: 4, 109816235: 4, 107929356: 4, 106022427: 4, 105798365: 4, 110923255: 4, 110746025: 4, 109193524: 4, 108478944: 4, 108266938: 4, 106210225: 4, 108857846: 4, 110148121: 4, 107297910: 4, 108320578: 4, 111795422: 4, 108899032: 4, 109383300: 4, 107932282: 4, 110164339: 4, 112467439: 4, 106720416: 4, 108181716: 4, 111982873: 4, 106640547: 4, 108329997: 4, 110619029: 4, 109018466: 4, 109187861: 4, 105862177: 4, 110315255: 4, 111850994: 4, 15142: 4, 112192174: 4, 110165451: 4, 108032974: 4, 106494505: 4, 107272204: 4, 200296165: 4, 110758970: 4, 107909507: 4, 107226876: 4, 111857489: 4, 110999688: 4, 200108528: 4, 108543653: 4, 106985791: 4, 107633879: 4, 107858105: 4, 106670299: 4, 200067404: 4, 111829790: 4, 109414386: 4, 200549812: 4, 107412430: 4, 107142289: 4, 107373153: 4, 112846784: 4, 106870707: 4, 200113321: 4, 10270: 4, 110689679: 4, 108031666: 4, 200293334: 4, 200634307: 4, 200877983: 4, 107314708: 4, 107529159: 4, 107519230: 3, 107483048: 3, 10168: 3, 106089213: 3, 107671020: 3, 106207412: 3, 106139012: 3, 14595: 3, 106058125: 3, 106344939: 3, 106637976: 3, 106755817: 3, 106325770: 3, 106579529: 3, 107476654: 3, 107273411: 3, 108099571: 3, 107638654: 3, 106586268: 3, 109444514: 3, 108843325: 3, 109767025: 3, 107065373: 3, 107768989: 3, 111016597: 3, 111169936: 3, 110839245: 3, 109692317: 3, 109544573: 3, 110423556: 3, 111970633: 3, 111687698: 3, 111955057: 3, 107696530: 3, 111841723: 3, 112104580: 3, 200173263: 3, 108793472: 3, 112042073: 3, 112129540: 3, 13364: 3, 200120733: 3, 200158745: 3}"

Climb the face (there is a short vertical crack) to an indistinct notch; the face below the notch can't be missed as the crack is obvious and there is a thin layer of dried bird shit on the face. (Not too bad, but your tastes may differ) After the notch go up 10 feet or so, drift right a bit and then back up and left to a prominent, well-chalked horizontal Use this horizontal to move over the bulge (crux), then traverse left and up for about 25 feet to an obvious V notch. After the notch, the top is not too far.  The first 40 feet or so of Pitch 1 is a bit dirty and indistinct, but the face climbing after that, up to the GT ledge, is fun.  The second pitch doesn't follow a line. But the moves are nice, the protection is good, there are some minor route finding challenges that increase the fun factor - and I've rarely seen anyone on it.

The belay anchor is best built off to the climber's right, even though the route comes up to the climber's left.  There's a bolted rappel station climber's far left; a 60m rope will bring you back to some ledges above the pathway, with an easy scramble down.

Erect Direction,105799041,Trad,107058090,5.10c,300,3,3.7,157.0,"Ask any climber what distinguishes the Gunks from other areas and the first thing they'll say is ""the roofs!"" That, or ""the sandbags!"" but you should look at the description of Coexistence for more info on that.  Erect Direction is a roof climb -- and one of my favorites at the Gunks -- right up there with The Yellow Wall, Carbs and Caffeine, and Fat City Direct.  The Erect Direction access trail is about 15 minutes walking from the Uberfall, and 10 minutes from where the East Trapps Connector Trail meets the carriage road. Look for a huge boulder (with problems/chalk) on the left. The access trail starts just past the boulder.  At the cliff, go right and up to get to the start of the route. Locate a huge right-facing corner; this is the route Updraft. Erect Direction starts at a hand crack on the left wall of this corner, about 20' left of the start of CCK.  P1 (5.8, 80'): Climb the nice, varied hand crack to the GT Ledge. This is a good solid 5.8 pitch on its own.  P2 (5.10c, 70'): Above you (you may need to move the belay to the left) is a massive roof system. Climb up juggy terrain to some powerful moves up a vague right-facing corner (5.10c, crux) to a cramped stance under a large roof. A few underclings to the right lead up into the massive, obvious right-facing corner with a bomber 0.75 Camalot. At the top of this corner, and below the biggest series of roofs, a cramped hanging belay is available, but I recommend running the pitch into the next one - this will require extensive backcleaning and lots of runners however.  P3 (5.10a, 60'): This is the crazy pitch on the route - make sure you get to lead this! Trend left off of the belay via some finger tip buckets, then reach back over your head to a jug at the lip. Begin working your way up a series of outrageous roofs with jugs galore. Plenty of opportunity for cutting your feet loose, heel-hooking, and hanging from gear. The roofs can be tackled more or less directly, but the easiest path is to traverse slightly left along the lip of the first roof, then back right on the second roof. A short corner with thin gear leads to the top of the wall.  Descent: Walk right about 100' to a notch, and scramble down the notch to the bolted rappel route by The Last Will Be First. 3 rappels with one rope get you back down. Or, to the left/south, three rappels from bolted anchors over No Glow will get you to the ground with a single rope.","{106985791: 4, 107002071: 4, 10168: 4, 106030548: 4, 12371: 4, 105990845: 4, 107771322: 4, 107561935: 4, 106071787: 4, 106089213: 4, 105804842: 4, 106041457: 4, 106571266: 4, 107865103: 4, 106095360: 4, 105961696: 4, 12525: 4, 106394111: 4, 105899901: 4, 106239703: 4, 11690: 4, 106151063: 4, 106058125: 4, 105846944: 4, 106762873: 4, 107030540: 4, 106831774: 4, 106841465: 4, 107246852: 4, 106325770: 4, 107431656: 4, 106344939: 4, 108104464: 4, 106441937: 4, 106785304: 4, 107089682: 4, 106238291: 4, 107902567: 4, 107178254: 4, 108996063: 4, 105898385: 4, 108032974: 4, 108201220: 4, 106993942: 4, 105891309: 4, 106879280: 4, 107574666: 4, 108363423: 4, 108344951: 4, 106740823: 4, 110496655: 4, 108843325: 4, 109005921: 4, 108726865: 4, 108082584: 4, 108367150: 4, 107194267: 4, 106486112: 4, 107119375: 4, 107400819: 4, 107830036: 4, 109411206: 4, 109816235: 4, 105798365: 4, 107238223: 4, 107549114: 4, 111955057: 4, 110315255: 4, 106897206: 4, 108320578: 4, 109719701: 4, 111829790: 4, 109064050: 4, 110619029: 4, 107633879: 4, 106405973: 4, 111687698: 4, 110746025: 4, 107678965: 4, 109168644: 4, 107929356: 4, 107240862: 4, 111161906: 4, 112192174: 4, 111344408: 4, 109542989: 4, 111850994: 4, 107417501: 4, 109142435: 4, 107453284: 4, 107629487: 4, 108100805: 4, 106949749: 4, 108793472: 4, 107434457: 4, 111929003: 4, 200337119: 4, 111822624: 4, 107007527: 4, 200067404: 4, 107185927: 4, 107226876: 4, 108103821: 4, 109033387: 4, 13364: 4, 10270: 4, 200568481: 4, 106189019: 4, 200120733: 4, 200158745: 4, 111662106: 4, 200634307: 4, 106687445: 4, 107475857: 3, 105886712: 3, 105811146: 3, 105892598: 3, 106423391: 3, 107026497: 3, 106125724: 3, 106579529: 3, 107696530: 3, 105851541: 3, 107807462: 3, 106146571: 3, 106901183: 3, 107935937: 3, 109767025: 3, 106655109: 3, 110423556: 3, 107518458: 3, 108495695: 3, 109180284: 3, 109328345: 3, 109451199: 3, 111795422: 3, 107932282: 3, 112817641: 3, 111970633: 3, 111857489: 3, 109884427: 3, 111308179: 3, 110689679: 3, 112042073: 3, 106596992: 3, 111796230: 3, 200297969: 3, 200371713: 3, 107691094: 3, 108329997: 3, 107493811: 2, 106493776: 2, 111841723: 2, 111777299: 2, 200288455: 2, 109472534: 2}"

Descent: Three rappels from bolted anchors over No Glow will get you to the ground with a single rope.","{106394111: 4, 106325770: 4, 106985791: 4, 107771322: 4, 106089213: 4, 107246852: 4, 107093945: 4, 106542092: 4, 107865103: 4, 105892598: 4, 106407009: 4, 106239703: 4, 105899248: 4, 106405973: 4, 105851541: 4, 106030548: 4, 106737343: 4, 106687445: 4, 106441937: 4, 107678965: 4, 106423391: 4, 105891309: 4, 106238291: 4, 106993942: 4, 106486112: 4, 106449525: 4, 107238223: 4, 108082584: 4, 107232016: 4, 108032974: 4, 108980214: 4, 105898385: 4, 109816235: 4, 106246427: 4, 108324210: 4, 107400819: 4, 107574666: 4, 107226876: 4, 108363423: 4, 109284031: 4, 107663290: 4, 110148121: 4, 109142435: 4, 110164339: 4, 111822624: 4, 108529353: 4, 111829790: 4, 106875721: 4, 106210225: 4, 109187861: 4, 106920912: 4, 200108528: 4, 107629487: 4, 112084693: 4, 107434457: 4, 200067404: 4, 106571266: 4, 112129540: 4, 108103821: 4, 13364: 4, 110122418: 4, 200158745: 4, 200288455: 4, 200810232: 4, 200624966: 4, 200635570: 4, 111662106: 4, 110062671: 4, 110830564: 4, 107475857: 3, 106403737: 3, 105788804: 3, 106071787: 3, 106299993: 3, 106041457: 3, 106344939: 3, 106151063: 3, 106762873: 3, 106794436: 3, 106125724: 3, 106897206: 3, 107767801: 3, 106102123: 3, 107658399: 3, 107185927: 3, 106146571: 3, 107178254: 3, 108608330: 3, 107268430: 3, 107768989: 3, 107007527: 3, 109767025: 3, 107569651: 3, 109544573: 3, 112097145: 3, 107929356: 3, 108367150: 3, 109018466: 3, 111841723: 3, 107696530: 3, 111857489: 3, 111850994: 3, 108793472: 3, 111777299: 3, 112042073: 3, 105798365: 3, 107529159: 3, 108160061: 3, 200120733: 3, 111315718: 3, 107206725: 3, 105813053: 2, 10168: 2, 105812812: 2, 110619029: 2, 111308179: 2, 106743355: 1}"
The Last Will Be First,105950518,Trad,107058090,5.6,230,2,2.9,183.0,"A highly under-rated route, The Last Will Be First is one of my favorite 5.6's in the Gunks, and an excellent test-piece for the 5.6 leader. Pitch 1 features great, sustained, thoughtful face climbing above gear on clean rock, and pitch 2 has a fun overhang.  The route is a short ways left of High Exposure. The start is on an easy, low-angle face with some grassy ledges about 10-15 feet up - look for a vertical crack about 30-40 feet above.  P1: Climb up the easy lower rock to a crack. Follow the steepening crack to its top, then continue up and right across the clean face to an overhang below a left-facing corner. Pull the overhang and climb the corner to its top, where it is capped by another overhang. Escape right and continue up to a small ledge with the stump of a dead tree. Step right and climb easier rock to the GT ledge. 5.6 PG, 160 feet.  P2: Walk left about 20 feet to the first small left-facing corner. Climb the corner to a horizontal, then diagonal up and left to the notch in the overhang. Make some fun moves to pull to overhang, then continue up the slightly dirty corner about 10 feet before diagonaling up and right on easy, broken rock to the top. A worthwhile pitch. 5.6 PG, 70 feet.  Descent: Rappel from the bolt anchor back to the GT ledge (your ropes land directly at the start of P2, so be sure to call before you throw them). On the GT ledge, another bolt anchor appears to climber's left, from which two 60m ropes will get you to the ground, or a single rope will get you to a third bolted rap station. This a popular area of the cliff, so watch where you throw your ropes.  From the clifftop (and other routes), you'll need to scramble down a bit to reach the bolts. Look for the notch where the climb finishes.","{106403737: 4, 105829522: 4, 106596992: 4, 106299993: 4, 107865103: 4, 105898385: 4, 107232016: 4, 107395144: 4, 107246852: 4, 107748535: 4, 107119375: 4, 106586268: 4, 107194267: 4, 107561935: 4, 108985245: 4, 110082976: 4, 109737113: 4, 110908587: 4, 110409351: 4, 111955057: 4, 109542989: 4, 200054289: 4, 200145837: 4, 112373727: 4, 200635570: 4, 200624966: 4, 200634307: 4, 106841465: 3, 106822110: 3, 106999733: 3, 106394111: 3, 106855118: 3, 105889415: 3, 107599369: 3, 107427221: 3, 107771322: 3, 105846944: 3, 106089213: 3, 106098470: 3, 105899248: 3, 106953954: 3, 107902567: 3, 105904878: 3, 106087077: 3, 106108233: 3, 106290147: 3, 106549589: 3, 106493776: 3, 105804842: 3, 106407009: 3, 106740160: 3, 106803582: 3, 106503119: 3, 107134320: 3, 107093082: 3, 107238223: 3, 107324366: 3, 107548455: 3, 107272204: 3, 107093945: 3, 108187975: 3, 107723931: 3, 106687445: 3, 107768862: 3, 107625137: 3, 108185728: 3, 108340305: 3, 107254662: 3, 106529846: 3, 107551540: 3, 107664805: 3, 105891309: 3, 107789096: 3, 109444514: 3, 107142289: 3, 107768989: 3, 109364349: 3, 107928271: 3, 108222065: 3, 108287262: 3, 108529353: 3, 107277941: 3, 109142435: 3, 109293682: 3, 110548079: 3, 105886625: 3, 108259746: 3, 107185927: 3, 108178915: 3, 109308723: 3, 110148121: 3, 108310475: 3, 109451199: 3, 109090889: 3, 109505100: 3, 108394904: 3, 107629487: 3, 108363423: 3, 110370905: 3, 110315255: 3, 106107825: 3, 109193524: 3, 111850994: 3, 111574222: 3, 106897206: 3, 109018466: 3, 108100269: 3, 112111219: 3, 110494556: 3, 107545559: 3, 107469778: 3, 106238291: 3, 110270698: 3, 110812900: 3, 109414386: 3, 106858324: 3, 111308179: 3, 108981414: 3, 200041551: 3, 109411750: 3, 112823201: 3, 112846385: 3, 111929003: 3, 111203516: 3, 110712867: 3, 200299483: 3, 111657384: 3, 106571266: 3, 110787766: 3, 200281409: 3, 110619029: 3, 200345231: 3, 200621286: 3, 200224193: 3, 112042073: 3, 112924258: 3, 200337119: 3, 200183967: 3, 200150625: 3, 200371228: 3, 111849990: 3, 108329997: 3, 108793472: 3, 112332863: 3, 107475857: 2, 107658399: 2, 105833226: 2, 105949578: 2, 106297607: 2, 106423391: 2, 106920912: 2, 106347425: 2, 106125724: 2, 108061618: 2, 105851541: 2, 107519230: 2, 107304112: 2, 108336210: 2, 107651072: 2, 106146571: 2, 106588555: 2, 108805745: 2, 107146835: 2, 107830036: 2, 108305825: 2, 111841723: 2, 107518458: 2, 108409574: 2, 109102869: 2, 111857489: 2, 106895019: 2, 111921737: 2, 200361391: 2, 109207991: 2, 108014881: 2, 200067404: 2, 112176219: 2, 106325770: 2, 200158745: 2, 200267777: 2, 107400819: 1, 109767025: 1}"
Limelight,105801563,Trad,107058090,5.7,180,2,3.3,507.0,"Limelight is another mega-classic on this great wall, along with Three Doves, Arrow, and Annie Oh!. Limelight is the easiest, so it may be the best choice for your first climb in this area.  The Limelight access trail is just past some white rocks on the left side of the carriage road, at an open area with a good view of the valley. This is about a 13-min. walk from the Uberfall, and a 9-min. walk from where the East Trapps Connector Trail meets the carriage road.  At the cliff, spot the huge left-facing corner of Easy Verschneidung (Easy V) on the right. Limelight starts about 40' left of Easy V and 20' left of Arrow.  Scramble up 15' to a ledge below a groove. Directly above you'll see huge right-leaning flakes that are 50' up the wall.  P1: Climb up the groove and face to the huge flakes. Follow the flakes up and right to the GT Ledge. 5.6 and a bit PG, 80'.  P2: Climb up more or less right above the first pitch, to a ledge. Continue up easy rock aiming for a left-facing corner. Pass a small overhang and make a dicey step left into a thin, left-facing flake at the start of the corner. Climb up the corner and traverse left under a roof (crux). Continue up a crack to a ledge, and go left to a bolt anchor. 5.7, 100'.  Descent: Rap from the bolt anchor back to the GT ledge (stretches a 60m rope - watch the ends). Downclimb to a big tree with rap slings.

Rappel down the bolted line over The Last Will Be First to climbers' left, or the High E bolted rappel line to climbers' right.","{106246445: 4, 106403737: 4, 107088550: 4, 12371: 4, 10762: 4, 10232: 4, 105795015: 4, 107559594: 4, 106999733: 4, 12448: 4, 107608024: 4, 7002067: 4, 105805825: 4, 15148: 4, 105823713: 4, 106785304: 4, 106494505: 4, 105832216: 4, 106953954: 4, 107658399: 4, 105880131: 4, 107448536: 4, 105812440: 4, 107771322: 4, 107551540: 4, 107400819: 4, 105859992: 4, 106655109: 4, 107125052: 4, 106071787: 4, 105886426: 4, 106089213: 4, 11278: 4, 106778424: 4, 105831725: 4, 107671020: 4, 106719962: 4, 105083738: 4, 105889270: 4, 106041457: 4, 106139012: 4, 106255690: 4, 106197143: 4, 106411080: 4, 105878863: 4, 106477370: 4, 106430658: 4, 105892598: 4, 106108233: 4, 105808487: 4, 105899248: 4, 106151063: 4, 106398812: 4, 11690: 4, 106113062: 4, 14152: 4, 105904878: 4, 106205646: 4, 106942628: 4, 105828100: 4, 105890286: 4, 106637976: 4, 106712274: 4, 106607660: 4, 106144110: 4, 105899901: 4, 107002071: 4, 106290147: 4, 106932322: 4, 106794436: 4, 106710887: 4, 105898385: 4, 107246852: 4, 106441684: 4, 106687445: 4, 107548455: 4, 107854794: 4, 106095805: 4, 107431656: 4, 108082584: 4, 107767801: 4, 107696530: 4, 107627695: 4, 107807462: 4, 107518458: 4, 107574666: 4, 107629487: 4, 107226876: 4, 106360234: 4, 106933730: 4, 107185927: 4, 108329997: 4, 108340305: 4, 106717383: 4, 106238291: 4, 107588981: 4, 108156518: 4, 107238223: 4, 106146571: 4, 108363423: 4, 108344184: 4, 106486112: 4, 105891309: 4, 107178254: 4, 107257835: 4, 107768989: 4, 108401191: 4, 106901183: 4, 108032974: 4, 108218304: 4, 105798761: 4, 106890022: 4, 107119375: 4, 107646553: 4, 105837552: 4, 107397192: 4, 106125724: 4, 109563509: 4, 108980214: 4, 107803888: 4, 109873901: 4, 108141805: 4, 107748535: 4, 109856888: 4, 107633879: 4, 108367150: 4, 109142435: 4, 108529353: 4, 109193524: 4, 108843325: 4, 107620610: 4, 110998345: 4, 111129685: 4, 108598790: 4, 107194267: 4, 108321835: 4, 110923255: 4, 110619029: 4, 108981414: 4, 110232694: 4, 109284031: 4, 109816235: 4, 107297910: 4, 107753556: 4, 105798365: 4, 109548191: 4, 108181060: 4, 107065373: 4, 107663290: 4, 108280591: 4, 107664805: 4, 112160188: 4, 108857846: 4, 109990981: 4, 110409351: 4, 109383300: 4, 106714648: 4, 109581184: 4, 108899032: 4, 110396163: 4, 109018466: 4, 106720416: 4, 107007527: 4, 112523761: 4, 106895019: 4, 108121411: 4, 110820340: 4, 109472534: 4, 112166649: 4, 107830036: 4, 112343811: 4, 111824829: 4, 108446880: 4, 107469778: 4, 107142289: 4, 111850994: 4, 15142: 4, 107929356: 4, 112192174: 4, 111829790: 4, 200054289: 4, 111982873: 4, 108103821: 4, 200267314: 4, 107909507: 4, 112527602: 4, 107886100: 4, 200074424: 4, 108802550: 4, 111344408: 4, 110494556: 4, 111777299: 4, 112104580: 4, 200115753: 4, 111974624: 4, 200067404: 4, 110165451: 4, 200389450: 4, 200337119: 4, 200361391: 4, 110712867: 4, 112134112: 4, 106571266: 4, 200146694: 4, 106920912: 4, 111796230: 4, 107574975: 4, 108895420: 4, 112373727: 4, 106870707: 4, 105791468: 4, 200150347: 4, 111574222: 4, 13364: 4, 10270: 4, 110970484: 4, 200371228: 4, 107373153: 4, 110548079: 4, 111878504: 4, 111969490: 4, 200169513: 4, 200810232: 4, 200288455: 4, 200634307: 4, 107002528: 4, 111696155: 4, 107545559: 4, 200399381: 4, 200147866: 4, 110830564: 4, 108071383: 4, 107314708: 4, 111315718: 4, 200368837: 4, 109005921: 4, 112042073: 4, 106325770: 3, 107483048: 3, 107475857: 3, 11926: 3, 10202: 3, 105821045: 3, 107525760: 3, 105888111: 3, 106441937: 3, 107093945: 3, 106596992: 3, 106985791: 3, 106297607: 3, 105934900: 3, 107865103: 3, 106207412: 3, 106493776: 3, 105851541: 3, 106235451: 3, 106423391: 3, 106347425: 3, 106344939: 3, 106762873: 3, 106844475: 3, 106848900: 3, 13658: 3, 106995775: 3, 107026497: 3, 106805104: 3, 106405973: 3, 106748471: 3, 106897206: 3, 106024037: 3, 106874511: 3, 107272204: 3, 106579529: 3, 108104464: 3, 106102123: 3, 107323487: 3, 106666369: 3, 107790918: 3, 108363879: 3, 107620691: 3, 107254662: 3, 108099571: 3, 108805745: 3, 108104429: 3, 106879280: 3, 108894743: 3, 107928271: 3, 105889415: 3, 107652586: 3, 106822110: 3, 107146835: 3, 109264747: 3, 106098789: 3, 108164781: 3, 109877052: 3, 111841723: 3, 111955057: 3, 112037097: 3, 111016597: 3, 106210225: 3, 107032446: 3, 107544688: 3, 109316126: 3, 108478944: 3, 110148121: 3, 111970633: 3, 111692889: 3, 112352056: 3, 112102872: 3, 108047997: 3, 200255818: 3, 112460885: 3, 109414386: 3, 107453284: 3, 200158745: 3, 200108528: 3, 200173263: 3, 108793472: 3, 111882861: 3, 200070559: 3, 110839245: 3, 112091216: 3, 109692317: 3, 108152222: 3, 106137716: 3, 200120733: 3, 200256288: 3, 107529159: 3, 108160061: 3, 109638995: 3, 111857489: 3, 110689679: 3, 10168: 2, 105811146: 2, 107094866: 2, 106449525: 2, 109767025: 2, 110391323: 2, 107678965: 1, 108000881: 1, 106280741: 1, 107240862: 0}"
Moonlight,105803407,Trad,107058090,5.6,230,2,3.2,246.0,"This is a delightful 5.6, almost as nice as Madame G's or High E. The crux is as exciting as any 5.6 in the Gunks.  The first pitch is easy to locate: Use the same access trail as for CCK, just past the Andrew boulder. At the top of the access trail you'll see an obvious crack/corner system leading straight up. This is about 35' left of the huge Erect Direction corner.  P1: Climb up the face just right of an overhang and head for an obvious anchor on some small trees. Then follow the corner up to a bolted belay at the GT Ledge. 5.5, 130'. Alternatively, you can start by climbing the crack behind the flake to the left, at 5.7+R, then continuing up the left-facing corner.  P2: Move right on the GT Ledge about 40' (this is the same as the start of the 2nd pitch of Erect Direction) and climb up, diagonaling left, towards a large roof. Once you reach the base of the overhang, look for a fixed pin to the left and place a nut or two to back it up. Now, the crux: cower left, down and around the corner to a stance. This is all balance - no big jugs to save your ass until it's over. Then up through a nice finger crack to the final corner (easier on the right-hand wall) and the top. 5.6, 100'.  If your second falls at the crux, lowering to the GT Ledge may be your only way to get back onto the rock.  Descent: there is a bolted rappel line fairly close to the south, starting with a fixed cable then rappels from bolted anchors, over No Glow, which will get you to the ground with a single rope.","{106971070: 4, 105795015: 4, 107620019: 4, 106108967: 4, 105927660: 4, 107668537: 4, 106299993: 4, 107651072: 4, 107518458: 4, 106205646: 4, 106263368: 4, 106132247: 4, 106001645: 4, 106588555: 4, 106920912: 4, 106681952: 4, 107854794: 4, 106394111: 4, 107714970: 4, 107902567: 4, 107185927: 4, 109308723: 4, 107553094: 4, 106011891: 4, 107277941: 4, 110359430: 4, 105886625: 4, 110409351: 4, 110427770: 4, 108857846: 4, 109451199: 4, 108178915: 4, 108394904: 4, 107142289: 4, 108976941: 4, 110425509: 4, 111850994: 4, 107625137: 4, 108324210: 4, 111289156: 4, 106325770: 4, 112412061: 4, 110619029: 4, 111857489: 4, 112111219: 4, 108110667: 4, 110812900: 4, 107544688: 4, 110270698: 4, 109092361: 4, 109525150: 4, 111657384: 4, 109542989: 4, 106106623: 4, 200134718: 4, 112449870: 4, 200122520: 4, 107594314: 4, 109414386: 4, 200074424: 4, 200067404: 4, 105787348: 4, 106778424: 4, 200374727: 4, 200399381: 4, 108329997: 4, 107412430: 4, 112846385: 4, 110340063: 4, 112116113: 4, 112846784: 4, 200371713: 4, 111496831: 4, 106571266: 4, 13364: 4, 108994382: 4, 112073495: 4, 200371228: 4, 107222279: 4, 200115753: 4, 200294652: 4, 200635570: 4, 200810232: 4, 105898385: 4, 200634307: 4, 11926: 3, 107619437: 3, 105889415: 3, 105886712: 3, 107400819: 3, 106089213: 3, 106098470: 3, 14568: 3, 107548455: 3, 105899248: 3, 107865103: 3, 107919874: 3, 106087077: 3, 105787518: 3, 106493776: 3, 106108233: 3, 106347425: 3, 106740160: 3, 105811146: 3, 106958111: 3, 106749092: 3, 105851541: 3, 107134320: 3, 106841465: 3, 106719962: 3, 107232016: 3, 106596992: 3, 107696530: 3, 107723931: 3, 105798761: 3, 107246852: 3, 106586290: 3, 108307042: 3, 107620691: 3, 107093945: 3, 107629487: 3, 106146571: 3, 106449525: 3, 108363423: 3, 107026497: 3, 108200561: 3, 107548227: 3, 108968342: 3, 109402402: 3, 106344939: 3, 108201220: 3, 106107825: 3, 108590756: 3, 107561935: 3, 107194267: 3, 106715529: 3, 109393254: 3, 109018466: 3, 108726865: 3, 107768989: 3, 110901677: 3, 110877362: 3, 109142435: 3, 108181003: 3, 110148121: 3, 111169936: 3, 111321249: 3, 106897206: 3, 109411206: 3, 107030540: 3, 109856888: 3, 107068335: 3, 109990981: 3, 108032974: 3, 106022427: 3, 108082584: 3, 108985245: 3, 108189638: 3, 110370905: 3, 107569651: 3, 111919008: 3, 110315255: 3, 110839245: 3, 107830036: 3, 109143868: 3, 200045869: 3, 111999314: 3, 110592577: 3, 111687698: 3, 107545559: 3, 112225055: 3, 106732573: 3, 110494556: 3, 105904878: 3, 110337843: 3, 108367150: 3, 109187861: 3, 112525633: 3, 106209804: 3, 110813958: 3, 109193524: 3, 110712867: 3, 107226876: 3, 110787766: 3, 112192174: 3, 106210225: 3, 111308179: 3, 200230321: 3, 200267314: 3, 200073484: 3, 200169513: 3, 110082976: 3, 107691094: 3, 200200791: 3, 108793472: 3, 112423730: 3, 200041551: 3, 112172937: 3, 112134112: 3, 112129540: 3, 112823201: 3, 200370966: 3, 106858324: 3, 108111761: 3, 200224193: 3, 111574222: 3, 112373727: 3, 107928271: 3, 111849990: 3, 106741264: 3, 109767025: 3, 200168968: 3, 200357953: 3, 200120733: 3, 106656746: 3, 200360582: 3, 200150625: 3, 106403737: 2, 107771322: 2, 105949578: 2, 106297607: 2, 106054402: 2, 106430658: 2, 106607660: 2, 106125724: 2, 108104429: 2, 106999733: 2, 107493811: 2, 110391323: 2, 110946269: 2, 200177277: 2, 112042073: 2, 200050086: 2, 200345231: 2, 109692317: 2, 110336734: 2, 111878504: 2, 110830564: 2, 200034945: 2, 110689679: 2, 108187975: 1, 110746025: 1, 109737113: 1, 109052547: 0}"

P1 (description by Anthony Baraff): The cliff-side trail is near a local low near the start of the climb. Look up for a distinctive right-facing flake in the overhang 40 feet up, and start 10 feet to the right at a shallow left-facing ramp below blocks 20 feet up. Climb the ramp up to the blocks, then follow the path of least resistance up to the overhang at the flake; climb up through the overhang before continuing up and left to the bolted belay/rap-station at the GT ledge.  There are many possible alternate routes up in the 20 foot-wide band of cliff above the start and below the belay station, but I think this description more or less matches the guide and keeps the difficulty at or below 5.5 G/PG.  Alternatives in the area for P1 include Three Vultures, Moonlight, Erect Direction, and even Cascading Crystal Kaleidoscope (CCK).  Pitch 2: Look for an arching roof about 30' above the GT Ledge. Climb up to the right side of this arch and then move right to a clean, white wall and cracks leading up through an exciting roof (crux). Definitely harder for short people. 5.9, 120'.  Descent: Rappel this route in 3 single-60m rappels. The first rappel from the top, which starts from a cable around two trees, is a rope-stretcher (watch your ends!).

Quiver,113080646,Trad,107058090,5.9,210,3,2.0,9.0,"This route is not too often climbed because the first pitch is right in the Arrow rap line, but if you happen to find a break in the traffic, a quick run on pitch one (5.8, 100 ft to GT ledge) is worth the trip.  The other pitches are basically contrived squeeze jobs to stay off the arrow line (or they are directly on the Arrow line, like p2).  Pitch three (5.9, 80 ft.) is practically within arm's reach of arrow (5-10 feet left), and IMHO provides Dick William's commentary on the old Arrow right or left finish controversy.    Pitch 1 (100 feet, 5.8):  The gray Dick states that it shares a start with Easy V.  If leading, I would recommend starting here as the gear is much better.  If on TR, it's more difficult and fun to start left of the Easy V start, but right of the start of Arrow.  A few feet right of the little tree growing out of the ledges that serve as the standard Arrow start will put you in the right place.  This pitch is nice face climbing with some horizontal ridges and cracks.  Grey Dick ends the pitch at the top of Easy V, but I recommend keeping the line straight to maintain the difficulty.  Once again, I believe DW's suggestion will give you better gear options.  Belay from the GT ledge either way.    Pitch 2 (30 feet, 5.7):  Walk left on the GT ledge until you arrive at the start of Arrow's second pitch.  Make your way, angling right, through the overhangs.  The grey Dick has you stopping to belay once the overhangs are over.  If you have a new second, this might not be a bad idea.  Otherwise, it's much easier to link p2 and p3.    Pitch 3 (70 feet, 5.9):  The start is more or less the same as the Arrow line after the overhangs.  You can force yourself slightly left, but some of the moves overlap, in my opinion.  For the crux moves, stay left.  I think this is where the difference in Dick William's suggested ratings come from.  A lot of climbers feel the left side finish is harder than the right side finish on Arrow.  Rating this 5.9 over Arrow's 5.8 supports that.

Alternatively, a single rap brings you down to the first pitch tree, and will keep you out of the way of other climbers.","{106344939: 4, 107620610: 4, 105852002: 4, 106095805: 4, 10762: 4, 107658399: 4, 107273411: 4, 107400819: 4, 107427221: 4, 107125052: 4, 106089213: 4, 106299993: 4, 107651072: 4, 107865103: 4, 105899248: 4, 106197143: 4, 106430658: 4, 11926: 4, 106108233: 4, 106151063: 4, 106001645: 4, 106932322: 4, 106588555: 4, 107322165: 4, 107221645: 4, 106394111: 4, 108082584: 4, 107663290: 4, 107417501: 4, 107246852: 4, 107232016: 4, 107142289: 4, 106751248: 4, 108187975: 4, 107553094: 4, 108581360: 4, 109563509: 4, 106542092: 4, 106238291: 4, 108367150: 4, 107518458: 4, 109816235: 4, 107928271: 4, 109052547: 4, 110901677: 4, 107587392: 4, 107646553: 4, 111021106: 4, 108310475: 4, 108052600: 4, 108363423: 4, 106953954: 4, 106022427: 4, 106398706: 4, 112037097: 4, 110148121: 4, 108529353: 4, 112271288: 4, 110930259: 4, 111829790: 4, 107545559: 4, 109193524: 4, 110999688: 4, 110409351: 4, 109281879: 4, 109187861: 4, 106689477: 4, 105898385: 4, 110758970: 4, 106209804: 4, 108103821: 4, 112084693: 4, 200108528: 4, 200194815: 4, 108793472: 4, 112042073: 4, 112192174: 4, 112823201: 4, 109316126: 4, 200158745: 4, 200249886: 4, 108329997: 4, 106589007: 4, 112050276: 4, 200371713: 4, 200113321: 4, 108994382: 4, 106793614: 4, 106554217: 4, 200635570: 4, 107540375: 4, 200350797: 4, 200337119: 4, 111878504: 4, 106423391: 3, 107483048: 3, 106403737: 3, 107559594: 3, 106999733: 3, 106897206: 3, 107618553: 3, 106441937: 3, 10186: 3, 105886096: 3, 105832216: 3, 105795015: 3, 105880131: 3, 107771322: 3, 107783937: 3, 105990845: 3, 105988971: 3, 105889415: 3, 105859992: 3, 107779099: 3, 106117267: 3, 107621295: 3, 107093945: 3, 107671020: 3, 107238223: 3, 105811146: 3, 105961696: 3, 106139012: 3, 105904878: 3, 106255690: 3, 14537: 3, 105878863: 3, 106407009: 3, 11690: 3, 106841465: 3, 106942628: 3, 106347425: 3, 13658: 3, 107026497: 3, 105851541: 3, 106687445: 3, 106920912: 3, 106125724: 3, 106762873: 3, 106246445: 3, 106985791: 3, 106719962: 3, 107272204: 3, 106886632: 3, 107185927: 3, 107678965: 3, 107661624: 3, 107953067: 3, 107226876: 3, 106993942: 3, 108391173: 3, 107089682: 3, 105812812: 3, 107178254: 3, 107768989: 3, 107638654: 3, 107356939: 3, 107548455: 3, 107268430: 3, 108307042: 3, 107194267: 3, 106666369: 3, 109767025: 3, 109525957: 3, 107929356: 3, 110185189: 3, 106879280: 3, 107588101: 3, 108805745: 3, 107389671: 3, 106325770: 3, 107240862: 3, 107776832: 3, 108014034: 3, 107174265: 3, 107146835: 3, 110619029: 3, 106717383: 3, 110391323: 3, 106486112: 3, 109620395: 3, 110396163: 3, 108305825: 3, 111781359: 3, 109136692: 3, 107065373: 3, 111968804: 3, 108201055: 3, 109505100: 3, 106210225: 3, 108478944: 3, 110839245: 3, 109737113: 3, 110462006: 3, 111955057: 3, 111738589: 3, 112524899: 3, 110534118: 3, 109018466: 3, 108981414: 3, 105892598: 3, 111850994: 3, 111687698: 3, 107469778: 3, 111928324: 3, 112102872: 3, 112343811: 3, 110816178: 3, 108751329: 3, 200180156: 3, 106649917: 3, 109451199: 3, 200057419: 3, 110689679: 3, 112846385: 3, 106571266: 3, 109414386: 3, 106449525: 3, 112134112: 3, 106596992: 3, 106146571: 3, 13364: 3, 110830564: 3, 200584755: 3, 200120733: 3, 112104580: 3, 111777299: 3, 108401191: 3, 200634307: 3, 107533935: 3, 200327054: 3, 105798365: 3, 107493811: 2, 106817494: 2, 106405973: 2, 107629487: 2, 10168: 2, 107935937: 2, 108608330: 2, 109152722: 2, 110423556: 2, 108104429: 2, 107569651: 2, 111169936: 2, 111841723: 2, 200059743: 2, 200146852: 2, 112460885: 2, 112129540: 2, 109207991: 2, 107529159: 2, 111857489: 1}"

Traverse of the Clods,106490427,Trad,107058090,5.9,0,2,3.4,53.0,"Traverse of the Clods is among the most interesting and unusual routes in the Gunks.  Its thoughtful, balancy, exposed, not too strenuous, not R-ratedyet seldom climbed.    TOTC begins on the GT ledge, on a 15 terrace to the left of where the first pitch of Andrew meets the GT ledge.  The final pitch of Hans' Puss starts from this same terrace.    The pitch begins a few feet right of a large right-facing corner and goes mostly up, with some trending to the right, for about 35 to a small overhang with an old pin above and to the left of it.  This section is 5.7 or so and is slightly run-out.    Next, head right past an overhang, then continue to move right and slightly upward for a few feet until you can traverse straight to the right for about 35.  A hanging belay can be built at the end of that traverse, at the intersection of a flake and a vertical crack/corner.  If you find yourself under a roof with a sling anchor, youve gone too far.    The second pitch goes straight up to a good horizontal a few feet above.  If you continue up from there, you will be doing the final, short 5.6 pitch of Twilight Zone.    To continue on TOTC, head directly right with your hands on the horizontal.  Your feet will be on a good ledge that will narrow as you continue moving right.  When the ledge disappears, you are at the crux.    After that difficulty is resolved, the route finishes around the corner, up a crack through a final overhang with a two-inch gap in it, which is visible from the carriage road.","{109638995: 4, 106486112: 4, 109620395: 4, 110262051: 4, 106210225: 4, 112343811: 4, 109187861: 4, 109018466: 4, 108529353: 4, 109142435: 4, 107417501: 4, 108793472: 4, 106394111: 4, 112129540: 4, 200181052: 4, 112042220: 4, 106720416: 4, 108367150: 4, 106785304: 4, 108311593: 4, 107400819: 4, 107246852: 4, 107865103: 4, 107428130: 4, 107493811: 4, 107663290: 3, 107678965: 3, 110494556: 3, 107658399: 3, 109193524: 3, 111829790: 3, 11690: 3, 105813053: 3, 106571266: 3, 200599831: 3, 106666369: 3, 105891309: 3, 107768989: 3, 108082584: 3, 107518458: 3, 106325770: 3, 109767025: 3, 107226876: 3, 107629487: 3, 108104429: 3, 105904878: 3, 106238291: 3, 107238223: 3, 105899248: 3, 107771322: 2, 110619029: 2, 10168: 2}"

Bonnie's Roof,105801433,Trad,107059022,5.9,250,2,3.8,512.0,"In 1937 Bonnie Prudden shattered her pelvis in a skiing accident. A doctor told her, ""You will always limp; no more skiing, climbing, dancing. And no children."" Nothing like a promise like that to stir a climber to great things: fifteen years later she made the historic first ascent of Bonnie's Roof, after the legendary Hans Kraus backed down and handed her the sharp end.    Bonnie's Roof is a really enjoyable climb that launches up the most obvious right-facing dihedral in the Trapps.  The Bonnie's Roof access trail is the next one after the High Exposure access trail, about a 15 minute walk from the Uberfall, and a 10 minute walk from where the East Trapps Connector Trail meets the carriage road.    P1 (5.9, 130'): Begin by jamming and stemming through several bulges to a high belay below the roof. One of the early bulges checks in at 5.9 and is the crux. This long pitch can be broken into two if necessary.    P2 (5.7, 50'): Traverse left across the steep face to the arete, following obvious chalked holds and gear placements, then head up to the top.    P2 (Direct): Bonnie's Roof Direct is a highly recommended variation that continues up into the roof, slightly right, and then pulls through the roof at a steep thin hands crack (5.9++) - wildly exposed!    From the top, rappel with two ropes.  With one rope, you can walk back to the High Exposure rap line, or head right to rappel over Ursula.","{106030548: 4, 107483048: 4, 106403737: 4, 105795015: 4, 10909: 4, 106999733: 4, 105873502: 4,

It climbs from the Ants Line bolted anchor upwards and right through a steep face filled with jugs and other positive holds.  The rock quality is outstanding and gear is abundant in all the right places.","{110462006: 4, 107787623: 3, 110165451: 3, 112091216: 3, 107469778: 3, 200249886: 3, 109542989: 3, 108103821: 3, 200299483: 3, 109142435: 3, 112373727: 3, 200463147: 3, 200277103: 3, 200466030: 3, 106299993: 3, 106741264: 3, 107246852: 3, 109451199: 3, 108478944: 3, 108363423: 3, 107768989: 2, 200371228: 2, 108305825: 2, 107548455: 2, 109018466: 2, 110396163: 2, 200187164: 2, 112134112: 2, 106325770: 2, 106394111: 2, 111841723: 2, 108181716: 2, 107518458: 2}"
Directissima,105799563,Trad,107059022,5.9,120,2,3.6,390.0,"Directissima is most commonly (if not always) done as a more difficult start to High Exposure. It kicks up the difficulty a few grades, but it delivers a first pitch that is almost as classic as High E's final pitch.  P1 (5.9, 60'): Begin a little ways right of the original start of High Exposure, near the nose of the buttress. Make a bouldery move up to a ramp and a leaning crack to a low roof, undercling around this roof and around the corner to the right (slick holds, some tricky gear. Continue up the face to the obvious belay ledge on the right side of the High Exposure buttress. A short pitch.  P2: From the left end of the ledge, traverse up and left, almost to the arete. From here you have to perform a difficult long reach to a good hold (5.9+), which is well protected with fixed pins. Belay at a perch just after the crux.  P3: Easier climbing leads directly up the very exposed arete to the spacious area on the GT ledge.  It is possible to vary or combine the climbing to the GT in several ways, including: a) climbing straight up just after turning the major arete on P1 (a nudge harder and a bit more runout), b) belaying only at the perch past the P2 crux, or c) linking the entire pitch to the GT.  Finally: Continue up High Exposure's last pitch - how else would you finish a classic route?  Descend by the bolted rappel route right of the buttress (one rope will do).","{106394111: 4, 107483048: 4, 106344939: 4, 106403737: 4, 12371: 4, 107246852: 4, 105813053: 4, 12448: 4, 105873502: 4,

High Exposure,105798994,Trad,107059022,5.6,250,2,3.8,1403.0,"High Exposure, aka High E. The climbing itself is flawless, but when one considers that the FA was done by pioneers Hans Kraus and Fritz Wiessner in 1941, it's even more incredible! The name, of course, is completely appropriate for this must-do Gunks mega-classic.The High E buttress is an obvious right-facing arete that is visible from the drive in from New Paltz. It is located about halfway along the base of the Trapps, right of the MF area and left of Bonnie's Roof. The High E access trail is about a 15 minute walk from the Uberfall.P1 (5.4, 180'): Begin the climb in a chimney/stemming corner left of the arete. Climb up this corner, only until it is possible to traverse up and right across the face, then climb up the face to a fantastic, spacious triangular belay ledge (this is the GT ledge) right on the arete below a large roof. Belay from natural gear or sling the huge boulder on the ledge.This pitch was originally split into two by belaying in the corner before heading out onto the face, but it can be easily combined into one with careful rope management.P2 (5.6, 100'): This is the money pitch, and is just about as exciting as 5.6... or 5.7 or 5.8 for that matter... can be. Climb up from the ledge (it's easiest to begin at the left side) and traverse right to the obvious place to turn the corner and make ""The Move"" to pull the roof - the exposure is immediate and the rock is steep! Continue up the face past gear, jugs, and fixed pins, trending left back towards the arete, until you top out. Exhilarating!Communication between the clifftop and the GT is notoriously difficult here, so plan accordingly.Descend the corner/gully to climber's right from three bolted rap stations with one rope.Also consider the Directissima variation instead of doing the original first pitch. Done this way, the climb checks in at 5.9, but you get what you pay for -- a first pitch that rivals the second in terms of quality.","{106778424: 4, 106890022: 4, 106726589: 4, 107483048: 4,

In The Groove,106792623,Trad,107059022,5.6,120,2,2.3,85.0,"Ascending an appealing natural line, In The Groove climbs an obvious corner with nice moves on the easy side of 5.6, and is a good warm-up for other nearby climbs.    P1:  Start up the corner, using the crack and face holds on the left to advance.  At the roof about 15-20 feet up step left and continue following the corner upwards.  There is a crux bulge, but in my opinion all of the climbing is pretty straightforward 5.6 or easier, and is well-protected.  As you get higher there are numerous left-facing flakes in the corner that provide good holds.  At about the 80 foot level, there is a dirt ledge at which you can build an optional gear belay-- I did not; I finished the climb as a single pitch.    Original P2:  A shorter, easier pitch.  After a few more moves upward, the rock to the right eases off to a stairway of blocks up which it is easy to climb to a large oak tree with a rap station.  Dick Williams describes this as a dying oak tree in his 2004 guide but as of June 2010 it seemed to me to be very much alive and thriving (but see comment below; as of 2013, not so alive).  From here, a single 60 meter rope rap just makes it to the ground.    Direct finish:  Williams describes a new direct finish in his 2004 guide, which climbs straight up from the end of pitch 1 to a small roof (crux), after which one climbs straight to the top.      I explored up to the roof, found the hold just under the roof to be a bit less of a jug than I expected, and then couldn't tell where to go.  There is a lot of lichen over the roof and it seemed unclear to me whether to go left or right; there were no obvious holds I could see.  It did not appear this variation had seen a ton of traffic.  The tree at the top is higher than the traditional finish, so you will likely need two ropes to rap, or you can walk a short distance to the Ursula rap station, which will get you down with a single rope in two raps.","{111924284: 4, 109451199: 4, 107246852: 3, 109018466: 3, 112279586: 3, 109193524: 3, 107464151: 3, 108100269: 3, 106580951: 3, 107093945: 3, 107293598: 3, 108257827: 3, 108110667: 3, 109990981: 3, 109052547: 3, 108189638: 3, 107830036: 3, 111952379: 3, 108367150: 3, 110165451: 3, 106928959: 3, 106325770: 3, 112373727: 3, 106299993: 3, 108489261: 3, 112162318: 3, 108324210: 3, 112924258: 3, 200936538: 3, 106999733: 3, 109142435: 2, 106897206: 2, 109611406: 2, 107574975: 2, 200242352: 2, 107928271: 2, 110712867: 2, 200084913: 2, 106571266: 2, 110270698: 2, 106858324: 2, 107715208: 2, 108103821: 2, 108152222: 2, 109102869: 2, 106917454: 2, 112026934: 2, 106030894: 2, 106503119: 2, 106125724: 2, 106822110: 2, 107238223: 2, 105889415: 2, 106263368: 2, 106680875: 2, 106748471: 2, 106714105: 2, 105851541: 2, 106297607: 2, 106953954: 2, 107771322: 2, 106913581: 2, 107548455: 2, 107174265: 2, 107723931: 2, 111692742: 2, 107587392: 2, 105886625: 2, 108032974: 2, 108187975: 2, 107735256: 2, 107768989: 2, 108363423: 2, 106394111: 2, 106963929: 2, 107518458: 2, 106407009: 2, 106637423: 1, 106519306: 1, 106864388: 1, 106089213: 1, 106564451: 1, 107651072: 1, 107395144: 1, 106841465: 0}"

Lakatakissima,110980901,Trad,107059022,5.9,80,1,2.6,19.0,"The first pitch gets no stars in the guidebook (and isn't included in the Gunks App) but it is excellent! It features the same kind of steep climbing as Doubleissima and Ridicullissima. Watch out for loose rock; there is a little bit, but it is easily avoided.  Even if you get to the GT from a neighboring route, the final 5.8 pitch of this route is a good option for topping out if High E is crowded. Also, it's a logical finish to Ridicullissima or Directississima.  P1 (5.10b): Start as for Doubleissima, up the right-hand 5.8 crack for about 40 feet to a ledge. Then move right about three feet to a small tree and a vertical crack system. Go pretty much straight up the steep face until you reach the roof. The guidebook instructs you to step left and join Doubleissima for a few feet below the roof, but I found this was not necessary. I was able to keep the line completely independent of Doubleissima. Once at the roof, go through the obvious notch about 5 feet to the right of where Doubleissima breaks the roof (crux, 5.10b). Continue straight up the juggy, steep face (5.8) to the GT Ledge.  P2 (5.8): From the GT, start at a crack and get some gear in above you before you pull up on the upper face. The crux of this route comes at you not long after you gain the face, but there are options for gear all through this section. It can be a bit pumpy through this section. Climb mostly straight up. When you near the top of the cliff, skirt just left of a tree (or more likely, a hole where a tree used to be) then jog right a few feet near the very top. There used to be a great tree right at the top, but it's gone now. The best option is probably using the High E rap station as an anchor. If you do, try to use it in such a way that you don't block others from getting on rappel safely.","{200674824: 4, 109284031: 3, 107232016: 3, 109018466: 3, 110164339: 3, 112037097: 3, 108363423: 3, 112129540: 3, 112373727: 3, 13364: 3, 200067404: 2, 107246852: 2, 107529159: 2, 111841723: 2, 107768989: 2, 106405973: 2, 106238291: 2, 105889415: 2, 107226876: 2}"

Psychedelic (pitches 2 & 3 only),119430728,Trad,107059022,5.9,200,3,2.5,4.0,"P1 starts on High E but instead of moving right eventually onto the face it continues straight up the big corner to the GT Ledge at 5.6. Many people do this pitch as an alternative start to High E but I haven't done it so I can't describe it.P2 traditionally begins in the chimney at the left end of the High E buttress off the GT Ledge, directly above the P1 corner. Begin with a few slick chimney moves, and then move left past a tree. The tree is very much in the way, and this little bit of unpleasantness is the only thing keeping these pair of pitches (2 and 3) from being very good. After this, pull the roof at 5.9 with good gear, before emerging onto a stance where one could build a belay (but it is possible to simply continue back right on P3.) [This description of P2 is provided by Eric R.]In the Trapps App it is suggested that one can skip the second pitch of Psychedelic by approaching the alcove from the stack of flakes on P2 of Modern Times. This is what I did to approach P3 of Psychedelic. I would STRONGLY suggest to anyone who wants to do this that you go higher on the stack of flakes than I did. I went across the flakes right at their base, and slightly up to the alcove. This required that I pass some VERY DANGEROUS LOOSE BLOCKS along the way. (See the beta photo.) Afterwards it appeared to me that one could traverse the flakes higher and step down to the alcove, which would be much much safer. The area beneath the loose blocks is always crowded with people and if the blocks were knocked off it could be deadly. Once in the alcove, P3 goes out straight to the right, using the obvious wide horizontal for hands. After about eight feet or so you trend a bit up to a horizontal that continues straight to the right for about thirty more feet, until you reach a sort of blocky, pointed feature. Move up onto this feature, and then it is an easy scramble up and right to the top of the High E buttress. The App gives this pitch a 5.7 rating but I think the guidebook rating of 5.6 is fair. The cruxes are getting started out of the alcove, and moving up onto the blocky feature at the end. It is overhanging with jugs for most of the way, so it is a little bit pumpy. There is good gear in many spots to protect the traverse. This pitch is super fun and exposed, and well worth doing. I gave this pitch two stars but would give it three or four if the approach to the pitch were more straightforward.","{107246852: 3, 108793472: 3, 106519306: 2, 106125724: 2}"

Start at the right side of the Yellow Wall face. A lieback crack leading up the yellow rock starts the route.  P1: Climb the crack, traverse right, go up a steep (and not completely well protected) wall to a short rightward traverse and the belay. A stellar pitch. Definitely not ""G"" but not too bad if you just go for it. 5.8, 110'.  It's also possible to belay at a bolt anchor after 60' and rappel from there if you don't want to do the entire route.  For a second pitch, you have three options:  P2: Climb easier rock to the top. 5.5, 70'.  In his 2004 guidebook Dick Williams recommends pitch three of Lisa, described here, as a good way to finish Airy Aria from the GT Ledge:  From the obvious rap tree atop Airy Aria, walk climber's right 20', until you emerge from the large overhang that's just five to six feet off the ground. You will see a clean, right facing corner (crux) capped with an overhang. When you get to the top, escape left on great holds, then climb straight up to the top of the cliff. Williams rates this a 5.6+, and I think that's fair. The initial corner seems almost featureless at first but it is all there and there is just enough gear, too. It's a really nice little pitch if you are in the vicinity. Once you finish, it is a quick walk back down climber's left to the GT ledge and the Airy Aria rap tree (which requires two ropes to reach the ground).  Or, the last pitch of Full Face (pitch 2 only) (5.6) is just another 15-20 feet to the right and it's also a nice diversion.  Descent: Two ropes to rappel, or walk back left to the Ursula or High Exposure rap lines.","{107400911: 4, 106841465: 4, 11278: 4, 106407009: 4, 106985791: 4, 106263368: 4, 105899248: 4, 107052200: 4, 106430658: 4, 110409351: 4, 107629487: 4, 107549114: 4, 109719701: 4, 111857489: 4, 110494556: 4, 108329997: 4, 112314245: 4, 109895944: 4, 110165451: 4, 111829790: 4, 108367150: 4, 109187861: 4, 200108528: 4, 111738589: 4, 200249886: 4, 200041551: 4, 200067404: 4, 107142289: 4, 106571266: 4, 111546553: 4, 200337119: 4, 111849990: 4, 110830564: 4, 11926: 3, 105795015: 3, 10168: 3, 106999733: 3, 106325770: 3, 105899901: 3, 106125724: 3, 106637423: 3, 106953954: 3, 105927660: 3, 105880131: 3, 107323239: 3, 107093945: 3, 107493811: 3, 107400819: 3, 107475857: 3, 106089213: 3, 106117267: 3, 107246852: 3, 106299993: 3, 106503119: 3, 106297607: 3, 105811146: 3, 106124374: 3, 105804842: 3, 10150: 3, 106087077: 3, 106344939: 3, 105990845: 3, 105892598: 3, 106514668: 3, 106290147: 3, 106108233: 3, 106549589: 3, 105842979: 3, 106347425: 3, 106280741: 3, 106773591: 3, 106519306: 3, 106762873: 3, 106591608: 3, 14152: 3, 106687445: 3, 106095805: 3, 107097681: 3, 106596992: 3, 106897206: 3, 107407794: 3, 107548455: 3, 105891309: 3, 107272204: 3, 107178254: 3, 108082584: 3, 107217526: 3, 106933730: 3, 107678965: 3, 105828100: 3, 107304112: 3, 107551540: 3, 106102123: 3, 107671020: 3, 107185927: 3, 108110425: 3, 107226876: 3, 106394111: 3, 106146571: 3, 107625137: 3, 107518458: 3, 110148121: 3, 106649711: 3, 109331514: 3, 106662993: 3, 107232016: 3, 107574666: 3, 108187975: 3, 107768989: 3, 108476315: 3, 108401191: 3, 109816235: 3, 106879280: 3, 110423556: 3, 109142435: 3, 107928271: 3, 110548079: 3, 108726865: 3, 110735180: 3, 110866897: 3, 106238291: 3, 109451199: 3, 110998345: 3, 109018466: 3, 106741264: 3, 107146835: 3, 110619029: 3, 108805745: 3, 107755397: 3, 106405973: 3, 108305825: 3, 110315255: 3, 112037097: 3, 111016597: 3, 109193524: 3, 107929356: 3, 108478944: 3, 107434457: 3, 106666369: 3, 107544688: 3, 107238223: 3, 106210225: 3, 111624894: 3, 108911162: 3, 112343811: 3, 109913395: 3, 200041839: 3, 200054289: 3, 106209804: 3, 112460885: 3, 200447544: 3, 107830036: 3, 112050276: 3, 112091216: 3, 107469778: 3, 111882861: 3, 111878504: 3, 109005921: 3, 200242352: 3, 108103821: 3, 200187164: 3, 106858324: 3, 107886100: 3, 112846385: 3, 200379970: 3, 112373727: 3, 106137716: 3, 112926469: 3, 200112890: 3, 111657384: 3, 110689679: 3, 200634307: 3, 112042073: 3, 107540375: 3, 200168968: 3, 107314708: 3, 107346586: 3, 200034945: 3, 108793472: 3, 200120733: 3, 111696155: 3, 106224522: 2, 106736701: 2, 105961696: 2, 106098377: 2, 107658399: 2, 107771322: 2, 10220: 2, 106041457: 2, 106020371: 2, 106235451: 2, 14537: 2, 105878863: 2, 106423391: 2, 106151063: 2, 11690: 2, 106719962: 2, 106905340: 2, 106848900: 2, 106001645: 2, 108136088: 2, 107026497: 2, 108363423: 2, 107417154: 2, 109767025: 2, 107194267: 2, 105851541: 2, 107032446: 2, 200045869: 2, 111921737: 2, 200132932: 2, 109692317: 2, 200051436: 2, 106646308: 2, 111777299: 2, 106449525: 2, 200345231: 2, 111850994: 2, 111662106: 2}"

To keep the grade at 5.8, start at obvious (but somewhat suspect) flakes about 10 feet left of the crack, climb up 10-15 feet, and traverse right towards the crack. Climbing the crack directly from the ground ups the ante to 5.9+. Climb the crack above, with some jamming and stemming, to a large ledge, and traverse left to a bolted anchor in a right-facing corner.  P2 is loose and possibly inobviously wet - not recommended! Diagonal up right via 5.4 face climbing, to the path of least resistance up to a large overhang (5.6, loose); traverse left here, then pull past the overhang to easier rock.

A decent, well-protected crack pitch.  P2: Climb up and right off of the belay through a wild system of roofs. There are frequent places to rest -- including a no-hands knee bar immediately below the crux. Reach up and clip a bolt, then pull a difficult move (11a -- but I thought it was harder) to a tenuous stance on tiny holds. There's a second bolt here but it's a really difficult clip and the bolt is total mank anyway -- you may consider skipping it. A few more desperate moves up and right will get you to a thank-God stance and #2 Camalot placement in a horizontal.

Climb up the featured face that is 20 feet below a right facing corner with several tiers of overhangs above.  Get up to the first of the overhangs, and find a way to get your hands above the first overhang-- this to me was the trick to the climb.  Once you have your hands above the first overhang, hand-traverse left to great holds from which you escape left to a stance, place gear, and make a couple more pumpy moves to a better stance.  Then it's straight to the top on an obvious path through the heavily lichened face.  The climbing here is cruiser and the pro is good, but it could use more traffic up top.

The good holds continue to the final boulder problem before the anchors.

Reach the anchor and rap.     A note from Ivan Rezucha:  I did what I thought was the FA on aid in the mid '70s. Dick Williams says it was done earlier by Dennis Mehmet & co., but I'm a little skeptical, as there were no pin scars. But perhaps in the hard Gunks rock, one aid ascent wouldn't leave any scars.    My ""FA"" was done as a self-belay, on all nuts, with hooks. At one point I did 3 hook moves in a row, with 2 hooks, by hanging on some small free holds as I moved a hook up. That was pretty exciting. I was either self-belaying with prussiks, or maybe I had moved up by then to jumars.    My name for the climb, ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"", came from this story: Jeff Pofit attempted (what we thought was) the second ascent. He didn't know that I had used hooks. He ripped his gear from the crux aid section, where the arch jogs right, and zippered a bunch of other gear due to the sideways pull caused by arching. He landed on his head at a soft spot between some rocks. I think he was carried away, but he would have been able to walk away.    The original route went right at the top of the arch to a platform on the arete, and then angled left and up on some nice free climbing at about 5.8.

The Yellow Wall,105798924,Trad,107059239,5.11c,125,2,3.8,43.0,"Some claim that The Yellow Wall is the best climb in the Gunks regardless of grade.  I'm inclined to agree.  It is awesome.    The Yellow Wall area is just right of Bonnie's Roof, and is easily identified as a towering, yellow, tidal wave of rock.  The climb begins from a large pile of boulders (these boulders are about 100' right of Silly Chimney) - you can scramble to the top of these from either side and there's a nice belay area there.    The route was originally done in three pitches, but is best done as two, and if done in one, is absolutely amazing (as long as you're very careful about rope drag).    P1:  Start up a right-facing corner, step around the corner to the left, and face climb up to a stance at a pin (may be missing -- see comments) and horizontal.  Belay here, or, if you were able to run it out to this point without gear, continue on.  60', traditionally rated 5.8 but I think it's more like 5.6.    P2: Climb up off the belay (PG) to a fixed pin which can be backed up with a wire. Step left and pull a roof at a modern bolt (put an extra long runner on this bolt or you will experience lots of rope drag, or, consider skipping it (dangerous), or back-cleaning it.  Face climb back right to a second bolt under the ""Mummy Roof"" -- so named because it resembles a sarcophagus from below.  Place the #3 Camalot and pull this roof (5.11c crux, with perfect beta it may feel easier, without the beta it may feel impossible).  Climb up and left (PG) to a possible belay in the Mummy Cave.  This was the original belay when done as three pitches, but do NOT belay here - if you blow the second crux you will factor 2 on the anchor.  Place gear and reach up to a hollow flake (please consider not placing pro here - the flake is a crucial hold and has already broken once) over the roof, lieback and step up to a stance in the corner.  Have your partner give you a bunch of slack here so if you fall you will drop into space below the Mummy Roof.  This is rated 11b or c, but is probably 11-/10+.  Climb delicately up the corner (PG13) to a crucial Yellow Alien/0.5 Camalot placement. Turn the arete to the right, and hand traverse 25-30' on easier climbing to a great belay stance (natural gear) at the top of the wall.    It's worthwhile to note that if the second falls off of this climb at certain points, it will be impossible to get back on (the falls are safe for the second, however).  Additionally, if the second falls at the crux, the rope can be abraded by dragging across the lip of the roof.    Descend from a rap station 100' climber's left from the top out.  Two 35-meter raps (a 60m involves some downclimbing); or use the old school descent, the chimney just left of the route (Silly Chimney).","{105898385: 4, 110423148: 4, 108032974: 4, 108223598: 4, 108312115: 4, 109719701: 4, 107932282: 4, 108367150: 4, 107240862: 4, 112070569: 4, 109638995: 4, 106897206: 4, 106985791: 4, 106405973: 4, 200108528: 4, 111710269: 4, 106571266: 4, 107178254: 4, 106762873: 4, 106389004: 4, 105878863: 4, 106071787: 4, 107771322: 4, 107246852: 4, 10610: 4, 105832216: 4, 105853558: 4, 10168: 4, 106535235: 4, 106041457: 4, 106831774: 4, 106151063: 4, 105828100: 4, 106942628: 4, 106607660: 4, 11690: 4, 106058125: 4, 105798365: 3, 111841723: 3, 108029460: 3, 200158745: 2, 110816178: 2, 111777299: 2}"

Kligfield's Follies,107486305,Trad,107059249,5.11d,75,1,3.8,19.0,"Because of Dick Williams' rather superlative description of the difficulty of this route, and after coming to expect 5.11 and up Gunks climbs to be extremely involved and generally terrifying, I'd kept away from it for a long time. However I was psyched to discover that Kligfield's is, for the most part, a good ol' mostly vertical pump with relatively straight-forward gear... reminiscent of a funky granite corner or something you'd find in Eldorado Canyon.  The line follows an arching crack system on the attractive pale yellow wall just left of Simple Suff. The crack begins about 20' up; start climbing well left of this using a large flake at the left edge of the wall to gain a mail slot for fingers and the first gear of the route. Move up off this to a shallow ledge, then continue back right to the start of the crack. Climb the crack to a tiny rooflet (the crack momentarily seams out here in a blank, left-facing corner) and set up to perform a difficult and possibly reachy move to another finger slot on the face out left. This is exciting and committing - suddenly there is no retreat and no feet. Don't panic; instead confidently load up the slot with a small cam or two, casually chalk up, exchange banter with your belayer and the gathering crowd, then lunge or dyno upwards for what appears from below to be nothing more than a sloper. You might be pleasantly surprised. Two more pulls gain a decent rest at a horizontal. Here the crack reappears and arches rightwards as the wall gently overhangs. After recovering, enter the sustained crux of liebacks, underclings, and good gear placements. It's a pumpy 20', but there is a chance to regroup midway with some modern sport climbing trickery and then things ease off just before the final steep bulge. Trivial climbing over this leads to a fixed pro & tat anchor (improved in 2018).  I can't believe John Stannard freed this in 1973.

They're relatively high on the cliff, at what can be a sunny warm spot on a calm winter day.  And because they're fairly far down the cliff, you'll likely have them to yourself.     Both routes start from the same little platform nestled among pine trees.  To get there, take the last trail up to the main cliff, as for Wasp.  At the cliff, go right, under the big mound right of Wasp, then up the gully to the cliff.  Keep on following a trail along the cliff, up and up, until you're forced to step right around some trees.  You should be at the start of the route, at a small pedestal/clearing above some talus below.    P1:  Climb up the easy fact of Sundance.  Williams describes a distinct pitch starting at a large left-facing corner, and tells you to climb its arete and face up to the ledge at 5.1 (you'd then have to walk 15' right to get to the rappel tree above the pedestal).    P2:  From the tree, make a few big easy moves to gain the rock behind.  Move right, up a few moves, then an easy airy traverse left to gain a face below an overhang.  Aim for the left side of the overhang, up into the left-facing corner it forms, then step right and up.  Wander on up through easier rock and a final groove above to the trees.

Then head up the face, with a few nice moves past another small overhang, and up into a left-facing corner, which is capped by yet a third small overhang.  Escape this corner/overhang to the right, and then it's straight up to the rap tree.

Sundance,107037481,Trad,107059249,5.6,130,2,2.1,28.0,"Sundance and its neighbor Moondance are two genuinely enjoyable routes on beautiful tight-white rock.  They're relatively high on the cliff, at what can be a sunny warm spot on a calm winter day.  And because they're fairly far down the cliff, you'll likely have them to yourself.     Both routes start from the same little platform nestled among pine trees.  To get there, take the last trail up to the main cliff, as for Wasp.  At the cliff, go right, under the big mound right of Wasp, then up the gully to the cliff.  Keep on following a trail along the cliff, up and up, almost to its top, until you can take a short trail to the right away from the cliff.  It should take you to the start of the route, at a small pedestal/clearing above some talus below.    P1: Climb up the easy face straight up to a tree with rappel slings; may not have as much protection as you'd like (5.3).    P2: From 10' or so right of the belay, make a big move or two leftwards to gain the face (you can also climb the corner/arete behind the belay, then traverse right). Keep climbing up and right under an overlap, and step up over it once you must.  Move back left and up to gain a ledge with a small pine, then head up the white rock above, finishing on the left of two crack systems to the cliff top.  Lots of finger-sized gear.    P1 and P2 can be combined, with attention to rope drag.    Rappel from a tree at the cliff top (2x 60m).  It's possible to toprope the face to the right of the route, at about the same grade and enjoyability.","{106054402: 4, 107464151: 3, 106299993: 3, 108690445: 3, 112449870: 3, 105904878: 2, 108259746: 2, 112314245: 2, 112423730: 2, 200249886: 2, 108793472: 2, 200158745: 2, 106095990: 2, 107400819: 2, 107518458: 2, 106087077: 2, 106297607: 2, 106089213: 2, 106596992: 2, 106016720: 2, 108187975: 2, 107735256: 2, 106407009: 2, 107768989: 2, 107902567: 2, 106394111: 1, 200509333: 1}"

It climbs the face to the left of Frustration Syndrome, and passes the roof left of the crux of Frustration. This route really breaks down into a few boulder problems, with each boulder problem followed by a decent rest.  The description in the Dick Williams guide book is pretty accurate, however, recently a direct line was done that avoids the upper parts of frustration syndrome: start on the direct start of Frustration Syndrome (5.11aR), and then climb left up into a small left-facing corner. From there you climb a seemingly blank face, up towards a small right-facing corner in the roof and pull through here.

Wasp,105830801,Trad,107059249,5.9,230,2,2.6,102.0,"This route gets three starts in the Gunks Select, and for good reasons. It's got great climbing and tends to be less crowded, due to the lack of other moderates around it.  Start 40' right of the hanging left-facing corner of Frustration Syndrome, at the last obvious crack on the right.  On the first ascent Pete Geiser put his finger in a pocket and got stung by ... you guessed it ... a wasp! For the longest time I had trouble finding a partner who wasn't afraid of wasps to climb this route. Rumor also has it that the name stands for White Anglo-Saxon Protestant.  P1: Climb the crack and shallow left-facing corner (crux), then up the right-facing corner and crack above (still hard) until it is capped by a small overhang. Step left, and continue easily up the face to the GT Ledge and belay, 5.9, 160'.  This pitch can be nicely split into a 5.9 and a 5.6 pitch with a semi-hanging gear belay at or above the rooflet; considering the low crux, this might be a good approach.  From the GT, as of June 2019 the tat around the tree atop P1 is gone, but there are still rappel slings and rings in the Sticky Gate tree to the right.  One rope will -just- get you to the top of the mound right of the start (but watch the ends).  P2: 5.5. This pitch starts directly above the belay for P1 at a shallow right-facing corner. Go pretty much straight up, heading towards an obvious left-facing corner/notch in the roof directly above you. As you get close to the roof, you'll see some holds to take you a few feet to the left and then back right again as you go through the notch. It is pretty airy as you move to the right, especially for a 5.5 pitch. There is gear but take care to extend your pieces well or face horrendous drag. Unfortunately once you get past the roof the rock is heavily lichened and loose. You can (1) go straight up through lichen and pine needles to the top of the cliff, or (2) diagonal up right to the tree above Sticky Gate, where there are rings and slings to rap down to the GT Ledge.  P2 alternate: Stubai to You, 5.9. This is a really great roof problem and keeps the overall grade at 5.9. Well worth doing. Begin up the same corner as P2 of Wasp but after just five or ten feet start to diagonal up the face to the right, heading for a left-facing corner in the underside of the roof, maybe fifteen to twenty feet to the right of where you started. As you diagonal up the face, the pro is spaced but the climbing is pretty easy. I get a crucial small nut in a little horizontal overlap on the way up. Once you reach the roof level there is good gear in an undercling crack next to the crux corner. At the corner, move around right and then bust it over the roof. Exciting and clean. Then move up and just a touch to the right to the Sticky Gate tree.","{107519230: 4, 106542092: 4, 106788981: 4, 106214584: 4, 106398706: 4, 107523564: 3, 107093945: 3, 107400819: 3, 106020371: 3, 107246852: 3, 106071787: 3, 106953954: 3, 106117267: 3, 106299993: 3, 106062921: 3, 105961696: 3, 106407009: 3, 106087077: 3, 106344939: 3, 105899248: 3, 106838681: 3, 106113062: 3, 106108233: 3, 106762873: 3, 106394111: 3, 106022427: 3, 105898385: 3, 106720416: 3, 108082584: 3, 107217526: 3, 107185927: 3, 107768989: 3, 106325770: 3, 107629487: 3, 107548455: 3, 107723931: 3, 106967283: 3, 108529353: 3, 107240862: 3, 107663290: 3, 107226876: 3, 107518458: 3, 109816235: 3, 107928271: 3, 111955057: 3, 107032446: 3, 105823713: 3, 109193524: 3, 107194267: 3, 108329997: 3, 112540373: 3, 112404909: 3, 110315255: 3, 108751329: 3, 106209804: 3, 110726793: 3, 107691094: 3, 200589828: 3, 200599831: 3, 105832216: 3, 10270: 3, 107373153: 3, 200371228: 3, 200120733: 3, 106030548: 2, 105788804: 2, 106441937: 2, 10168: 2, 106596992: 2, 106089213: 2, 105892598: 2, 11690: 2, 106246445: 2, 106290147: 2, 106158262: 2, 106405973: 2, 106571266: 2, 105851541: 2, 106897206: 2, 107696530: 2, 106001645: 2, 107238223: 2, 107178254: 2, 108099571: 2, 105798761: 2, 109767025: 2, 106238291: 2, 105890911: 2, 110148121: 2, 106981430: 2, 109142435: 2, 109018466: 2, 110619029: 2, 106879280: 2, 111777299: 2, 106449525: 2, 108793472: 2, 200634307: 2, 111546553: 2, 106235451: 1, 107678965: 1, 106942612: 1}"

Start by romping up some easy terrain, making the first two clips and then swing around to the right of the arete for a few moves. Make a super tenuous swing back left to the face proper and make a cruxy third clip. From here, the buisiness begins: Use an atrociously small left hand crimp and get a high left foot, eventually bumping all the way up to a small crimp (V7ish in itself). Without resting, mount the second crux by using froggy foot technique on impossibly small holds until the large slopey horizontal can be had (V5/6)...phew! From there the climbing is technical mid-eleven crimping that feels way harder after pulling the difficult, thoroughly pumpy moves down low. Clip the chains and enjoy the uniqueness of Little Falls ambiance...      The line had been climbed before on toprope by a variety of people over the years, but wasn't bolted until September 20th 2010. Two holds broke over the last year, upping the difficulty a notch. The first one is is a left hand crimp in the second crux that got smaller. The second one is the massive rest jug midway up- it's now a sloper that makes resting a lot more difficult.

I found exiting to the left to be a bit easier, but you could also go straight up using the small left-facing arête formed by the right wall. Scramble off to the right.    I don't boulder much so don't really know about the grade, but it felt like pretty solid 5.11 crack moves to me. More importantly, it is really fun!","{106238291: 3, 112335098: 3}"

From Where I Am,118942708,Boulder,118942644,V0-1,25,1,3.0,1.0,"There are a lot of different options on this rock - it's definitely a high ball topping out at 25ft or so.   Since I'm not experienced outdoors, I stuck to a traverse at about 8-10 feet off the deck. There's some decent pad placement on mostly flat ground, but a few spots that aren't as flat / easy. This rock also has some really good foot holds - in some cases small ledges. Hand holds generally pretty solid as well. The height of the problems I think make it a V0+ to V1- someone with more experience outdoors could probably top this out without issue. The walk off the back is possible, but I wouldn't really want to do it with climbing shoes on since it's kind of narrow / steep.   The quality of the rock is nice on your hands, I'm not sure what type it is, but I liked it. ",{200656083: 3}
