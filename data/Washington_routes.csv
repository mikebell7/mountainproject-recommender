Some nice knees and fists bring you up to a broad ledge about half way up. From here, knees, chicken wings, and wiggles get you up to the top of the offwidth (squeeze chimney for smaller bodies) where you can stem out to the left to clip the anchors on Nightbird.You can also climb this as a stemmy face climb and plug gear into the crack as pro for an easier time or as a bail option if you’re new to the wide.This crack has similar movement to the offwidth just next door - Swashbuckling 101 - but less sustained. The crux down low is what defines the grade. Above the bulge is cruiser and a good intro to wide climbing with lots of rests to take stock of you technique and make adjustments for the next bit of squirming. This one may be the best soft intro to offwidth that I’ve come across so far!If you’re going to TR this, then I suggest a #7 or #8 at the top of the crack as a redirect from the anchors...or at least until we put in new anchors in a better location directly above the line.",{200115635: 3}

So I added a anchor, but it is still very hard to protect in some places. Now this cracks me up because trad people chop bolts, but on trad climbs where the crack is thin, there are sometimes many pitons, including many on the Middle East wall itself.It is 10d in the book, but I thought in comparison to other 10d's and 11a's it was technically tricky and crazy burly for 10d.I would give this route 3 stars for climbing especially the roof moves, it is just fucked up at the moment.I did some cleaning on this and it is less chossy now on the lower part, the upper half is solid rock.","{106920443: 3, 106670517: 2}"

Jam this crack as it widens to thin hands, with the usual Vantage stemming and barn-door foot jamming.  A short pod and some slightly blocky climbing will get you to the anchors.    Overall the rock quality is very good for Vantage, but it still is Vantage so be a little careful.    The original finish involves climbing above the anchors over a few steep, not 100% but not super-loose blocks.  On top, there are a couple bolts in random blocks, set back pretty far from the edge.

Mr. Gorbonifar,119007589,Trad,105793346,5.10a/b,80,1,4.0,3.0,"This may be the best offwidth in Vantage by far. It’s clean, sustained, and offers a range of widths that keeps you thinking.  Start atop a small ledge in the right-facing corner. The crack begins with some fists, but quickly turns into butterflies and hand-fist stacks. Unless you have small knees, you won’t be able to get into the crack for a solid knee jam until it widens a bit further.  Once inside, work your way up the ever-widening crack through some minor waves before getting into the three large squeeze chimney waves toward the top.  The location of the crux is somewhat body dependent. Most will be fine down low and again up high once into the squeeze chimney section, but will find the middle section challenging. If you’re solid making progress on knee scums, then maybe the two largest waves in the chimney will be your crux.  This offwidth is perfect for bumping the bigger cams with only a few sections up top that requires a pull and re-placement above you.  There are chains to the left of the top of the crack that you can get to so you don’t have to top out through the loose blocks above. If you’re setting up a top rope, then leave a piece in (BD #8 or equivalent) at the top to redirect the rope.  The original rating for this route is 5.9 and that’s what’s in the current guidebook, but compared to Wide and Curvy 5.9 (an offwidth right next door) from the same FA team, this is easily a grade higher. I am posting it as a 5.10a/b to be consistent with the softer grading that is prevalent in this area.

The route to the chains follows a crack- mostly fingers with some hands/offwidth near the top. There are plenty of face holds and solid feet the whole way up.  I prefer to lead it as a trad route, where it holds the same grade- maybe a tad harder (.10a?) in one section about 2/3 of the way up, but only if you're sticking entirely to jams. The reason for this being it requires 3 straight finger jams way over your head, one on top of another, with semi-awkward feet (but not awkward if you escape the crack and grab the crimp).  In general, the rock is pretty solid- very solid by Vantage's standards. A #0.2 placement is available about parallel with the (low!) first bolt, though it's kind of hard to find. It won't protect you from decking for very long, but you won't go rolling down the hill... From there, I use doubles and sometimes triples of #0.3 & #0.4 in the finger crack, depending on how much I want to sew it up. Supplement with stoppers, as needed. At the top, there's an OW section that I usually protect with a #0.75 at the bottom, but I once plugged a #1. I think a #3 or #4 would work in that same area, but I've never tried it.

Near the top the chimney widens and the rock becomes smoother and less eroded. Keep chimneying through this and exit to the left.

The offwidth, which runs from tipped out #4 up to tipped out #6 in sizing.  The start is in a shallow hand crack that wanders through about 15 feet of dirty, exfoliating rock before transitioning into a deeper, undulating cupped hands and fist crack for the next 15 feet. You’ll find a couple of cruxy bulges to get past in the fist crack before it widens to the offwidth.  Once in the offwidth, you can cruise a bit more efficiently if this size is your jam. If it’s not, then thrutch your way up through a few constrictions until the final, much wider portion at the top. Place your last piece of pro (tipped out #6 or a solid Merlin #8 or Big Bro #4 if you’ve got them) and then traverse right to the top of the adjacent pillar and the chains of Manxome Foe (5.10a) to top out.

On a positive note, there was no pidgin shit because it was too thin.   The route description says climb the thin crack on the right side, switch 2/3 the way up. I did that and also the left side crack all the way up. There was much dirt streaming out and toaster oven size blocks coming off.    Still might be an area classic some day.

The route begins with an interesting set of face moves to get over a bulge that’s in your face from the start. Once you’re able to get into the crack, you’ll find that it’s width varies as it curves back and forth up the column. This makes for some interesting mini-cruxes that will eventually lead you to wider climbing with a fun top out move.  There is a lot of loose rock on this route that tempts you as face holds offering an alternative to the sting of the offwidth, but it’s best to stay in the crack not just from a purist perspective, but also for safety. Using the face throughout the climb will result in a 5.7 rating, while you will get a 5.9 from staying in the crack.  Right now, the best way to anchor is to redirect the rope through a BD #3 in the corner crack above and to the back of the column and then run through the chains at the top of The Jagged Edge 5.7.

Right now, the best way to anchor is to redirect the rope through a BD #3 in the corner crack above and to the back of the column and then run through the chains at the top of The Jagged Edge 5.7.  Ultimately, chains need to be installed on the right wall directly over the route for a less complicated rope situation.",{200115635: 3}

Start on the lowest decent sideull for your left hand, and your right hand wrapped around the arete, on the smooth, polished, butt cheek-like hold. You'll have a great left foot, and a poor right foot to start.    Down low, you'll find an awesome techy kneebar, some sequential moves, a cool thumb-intensive pinch, and a classic tensiony transition move to a good crimp that allows you to get to the sloper above.    Although the bottom is challenging, you may find more trouble getting through the topout, which involves a heinous power-mantel on the aforementioned sloper, using difficult to see and not very good feet, and a thrutch to a decent crimp way up the left. Tougher because the bottom is a bit tiring. I think this thrutch could be considered a detractor by some, but I thought it was a nice capstone to the difficulty of the boulder- it really doesn't give up until you are standing on the slab above.   It is also possible to do the topout by avoiding the crux finish move, and heading right from the last big sloper. I've heard that this way is easier, maybe v8-ish.

One thing that everyone will say is that the route is overbolted, and they're right-- it's often possible to clip a bolt and back clean the one below it from a single stance. This a distraction from the quality of the climbing, which is a shame. Condorphamine Addiction packs some enjoyable moderate pitches and two excellent friction crux pitches into a long climb that ends in a commanding position high in Icicle Creek canyon.  I'm giving this route 4 stars for it's aesthetic position in the canyon, for being a long and enjoyable multipitch sport climb, for interesting climbing on (most) of the easier pitches, and two crux pitches that hold their grade. It's probably worth fewer than that, but I couldn't bring myself to give it 3.  The climb could be done in 7 30M pitches and I've described the climb that way below, but no sane person would climb it that way. We combined P1&2, 3&4, and 5&6; I think it would be possible to combine any 2 pitches with a 60 M rope. It may be better to split P5&6 so each leader gets one of the hard ones. Find the start of Condorphamine Addiction near the far right side of the buttress.  P1. A short 5.8 pitch leads up to a set of anchors low on the face (yes, those anchors).  P2. From the end of P1, climb up and into a corner (trickier than it looks), and make a series of interesting 5.9 moves up to a nice belay ledge. (5.9)  P3. The dog of the climb, this is a short section of class IV and 5.0 climbing up and left on ledgy ground.  P4. Head up on a face angling to the right. 5.8/5.9.  P5. The first crux pitch. The crux involves interesting stemming and friction moves in an imposing and steep position. 5.10b  P6. From the top of the 5th pitch continue up on 5.10 climbing to a crux section on delicate edges (5.10b). Combining P5&6 gives close to 200 feet of quality 5.10 face climbing.  P7. Climb fun 5.5 terrain to the top.  To descend, you can rap the rotue and with 2 60M ropes, you can speed your descent and have more flexibility to avoid ascending parties.

The upper crack is a long, pumpy, overhanging hand crack, with occasional finger locks, and stems out to sometimes good edges and smears.

The best things about this route are that the rock is impeccable, the line follows the major weakness in the cliff (there's an elegance in this, when it happens, I think), it takes good gear at the 5.6 parts, and you get to climb for a good long while.

The pitch ends to the right.  Use long runners, or carry a winch to bring the rope up at the belay.  There are some cool moves in an odd, low-angle chimney at the bottom, and a fun mantel/step up to the right.  Belay less than one rope-length above at a modern rap station.    Pitch 2 (5.easy/J1): With just a few moves of fifth class climbing, make your way through the low angle section to the base of the next pitch.  If memory serves me, this is a traditional anchor.    Pitch 3 (5.6): Fifth class pretty much the whole way, with a bleached, wide, low-angle 5.6 crack at the top. Belay at the trees - a 48"" sling makes for an easy belay set-up.

The Kramar guidebook calls it ""one of the most popular routes"" in the area.    It's an okay route, and a decent lead for a 5.7 leader, but it's a long way up there and the good climbing on this one is fairly short.  I personally don't think it's worth the approach.  There are a handful of other routes in the area, but if you're coming up to lead Givler's, you probably won't be leading them.    P1.  Begin in an alcove near a tree.  Some tricky moves off the ground lead to an obvious crack heading up and left.  Belay on top of the horizontal flake. ~40 feet, 5.7+.    P2.  Head straight up the hand crack above you.  The initial climbing is fun and interesting 5.7 with good gear, but after 50 feet or so, the angle of the dome begins to fall off and the climbing gets easier and easier and less and less interesting.

Thin climbing up a thin corner with some thin gear leads to a brief but burly off-fingers crux pulling a bulge.  Hope you can make the exit look elegant.  I couldnt.    This climb was written up in a 1988 Rock & Ice article by Alison Osius, whod once spent a summer guiding for Leavenworth Alpine Guides (LAG) and had come back to revisit old friends:    ""For my last day, Katie [Kemble] trudged me up a loose hillside to a wild crack she promised no one had ever done.  A steep corner up thin edges led to push-palming and bridging up the seam.  At the roof that caps the pitch, I ran into trouble  I sunk awkward thumbs-down hand jams, moved my torso up with hands still low, and frogged my feet high.  Caving in my ribs, I half-cornered the arête to get a foot up onto a shelf.  Then I couldnt pull either hand out.  I pumped out and rattled down to the rest.  Repeating the process again and again and again, every time I panted Sorryone more time, Katie would sing out cheerily, Oh, no problem.  So I ventured and retreated at least eight times.  A gouge began to trench into one hand.  But I really wanted to finish the climb, and to name it the LAG Roof for Katie, [Jim] Donini, Karl [Schneider] and Dave [Stutzman]. Then came the magic moment when the jam felt just that tiny bit better.  Visions of glory trumpeted; a great new routemaybe some copy so I could write the trip off!  Then I was up, belly-flopping over the top.    That night something woke me at 3:00 AMelectric pain in my elbows.  In the morning, I tried to tell myself Id been dreaming.  But, I thought, at least if Id hurt myself, it was on something emotionally satisfying, that tied the climbs and people of Leavenworth together.  An epiphany, come to think of it.  Then, the more I thought about it, the harder the route got.  Pretty soon my internal dialogue declared Eleven-d, fer sure.    I called Yoder, and asked him about that crack.  He listened to my description, asked a question or two.  Yeah, Pumpline.  Eleven-a.  I did it three years ago.'""

The route climbs the giant roof we have all stared at for years. There are 6 new pitches with the 7th pitch taking the final corner of Galaxy. The route requires all your climbing tricks from slab climbing to physical roof wrestling.Approach:  Approach as for Orbit. Stop at the pedestal before the leftward 4th class slab moves to the large ledge with the tree that often has tat. Look for a bolt on the slab signaling the start of the route. Belay here for P1.Pitch 1- 70m 5.10  Climb up the slab to the first bolt. The start is a bit dirty yet on purpose to throw everyone off :D. Follow features of weakness between bolts and intermittent pro diving right around an arete and then up into a corner with a thin crack. Climb up and past the welded blocks clipping a bolt and up onto the jungly ledge. Belay on the right side of the ledge in the corner crack behind the massive block.Pitch 2- 40m 5.11 Start up the left-facing corner crack. Stand atop the ledge and notice the giant rockfall scar taller than you. Climb the sealed corner crack with help from holds on the arete (1b). Surmount the roof (1b) and climb the finger crack. Follow the flake up and left to the arete and a bolt. Climb the arete passing 2 bolts and climb right into the corner overlaps. Climb straight up the corners clipping a bolt then make a long reach and traverse right on the flake. Transition to the awkward layback crack with small gear until the crack widens into hand size and there is a  horizontal crack to your left. Belay here.Pitch 3- 30m 5.9 Follow the crack up to a bush and follow the short, left-leaning crack then continue up and rightwards on rails and dikes into a broken corner system climbing up onto a major ledge. Climb the dikes on the slab up and right to the clean wall and the anchor bolts.Pitch 4- 20m 5.11 Follow the bolts (6) up the impeccable rock through fun sequences with small slippery holds. Mantle up onto the “Moonwalk” ledge and walk right to the anchor.Pitch 5- 50m 5.11 “Jimmy’s Roof” Climb up the face past 3 bolts. Place your gear as far out in the solid tips crack under the roof as possible. (*Note that the jug rail under the roof, hand crack through the roof, and horizontal jug rail formed by roof block are not suitable for pro! There are other gear opportunities available at the lip.) Crank through the airy roof and transition to the leftward undercling traverse. Clip the bolt above your head and go all out for the jug. At the second bolt do not go immediately right, continue straight up eventually gaining a right-leaning offset seam and finger crack. When the finger crack seals shut directly below the bulge with a horizontal, go straight up this bulge on sloping holds. Follow good features up to the left side of the diving board ledge. Belay off-hand size pieces behind the block.Pitch 6- 30m 5.8 From the belay climb the rail up and left and then step over the belay on chickenheads. Clip the bolt and then tackle the roof. A long pitch of chickenheads takes you on a rightward and mostly unprotected journey to the base of the Galaxy corner. Belay on anchor bolts.Pitch 7- 5.9 30m This is the last pitch of the Galaxy route. Climb the right-facing corner passing a couple of chockstones. Exit the corner and climb the chicken heads towards the tree on top of the wall.  One can logically link Pitch 6 and 7.","{113374239: 4, 111793245: 4, 200163780: 4, 200093609: 4, 110456934: 4, 106181408: 4, 106940732: 4}"

Hyperspace,106279399,Trad,105792154,5.11a,800,7,3.8,60.0,"Hyperspace is a combination of various pitches on Snow Creek Wall, generally following the left side of the massive ""Shield"" formation. The climb is in between the two moderate classics, Orbit and Outer Space. Several minor variations exist.      The traditional start is RPM, a runout 5.10+ dirty slab. The more common start is Remorse.    P1 - 70m     P2 - 30m - 5.11a - The Psychopath pitch follows a nice finger crack off the left end of the belay ledge. This crack eats up small nuts and cams. After about 1/2 or 2/3 of the crack's length, a few small knobs appear on the left. Move onto these knobs, then from the top of these knobs, swing back right into the crack and up to the belay ledge. Alternatively, its possible to continue to face climb out left of the crack for the remainder of the pitch (5.7R).    P3 - 50m - 5.9 - Follow obvious cracks up a right-trending ramp and corner.     P4 - Step right from the belay (look down and note  the massive fresh rock scar!) Follow thin flakes, slabs, and a corner upwards, with better than expected pro.     P5 - 40m - 5.10c - Follow the beautiful left-facing corner, past a small tree and bolt (which would be used to link into Outer Space).     P6 - 40m - 5.10d - There are two main corners/chimneys.Eventually be in the rightward one, although both are initially climbable. The left one leads to a sticker bush, move rightward before this point. From the top of the chimney system, face climb leftward (often fixed gear) and make a few desperate and physical moves upward into a flaring/cramped stance (The Pressure Chamber). Face holds on the right wall allow one to stem wildly rightward across the overhang, and reach and thin finger crack, and then a much better positive layback flake. Above this spot, follow the left-facing corner for 25' (5.10a) and then traverse left on a hidden foot ledge to comfortable belay.    P7 - 30m - 5.10a - Traverse left to the end of the foot ledge and follow the crack up to a roof.

Iconoclast,107191762,Trad,105792154,5.10c,800,8,3.4,48.0,"Iconoclast is a near classic; it has some interesting cruxes that are mostly well protected while maintaining fairly easy climbing on a spectacular wall.  Most of the climb shares pitches with Hyperspace while exiting the Iconoclast corner/dihedral system to the right for the Shield (Hyperspace continues up for two more pitches).  The exposure on the Shield is wild as you roam around slinging chicken heads and a few sparce bolts.    The start of Iconoclast begins after climbing the first two pitches of Remorse (typical and described below) or RPM.    Remorse:   Begin directly below the roofs that form the underside of Two Tree Ledge (you will be standing on the trail just to the left of the small scrub trees that are at the high point of the base of the wall).    P1- 45m+ - 5.6 - Climb easy 4th class ledges and corners to a 4th class ledge system that angles up to the left.  The ledge system ends 20' below a small bush in front of a large flake that typicallly has many slings around it.  Climb the right groove up and traverse left to the bush/flake.    P2- 25m+ - 5.8 - The next pitch traverses left all the way to the Psychopath ledge; start with some groove and face climbing up left aiming for the undercling flake; work your way back down the flake and traverse until you are forced into a balancy no hands traverse to more cracks; continue left along a rounded ledge (that works better for hands than feet) and finish with a mini crux up to the Psychopath ledge.  Belay either at solid cracks and tree prior to the ledge proper, or continue across the gravelly ledge to the tree on the far side.    These can be climbed as one pitch with a 70m rope, or some very easy simulclimbing for 20+ feet (for the second) until the lead can gain the Psychopath ledge and set a belay.    Iconoclast:   Many people will climb the Pyschopath crack as a variation from here.   P3- 35m - 5.8+ - Around the Corner: Traverse out left (one bolt) and around the corner on some easy but exposed face climbing until you reach a crack; continue up the crack until ledges and cracks above the Pyschopath crack.    P4- 50m - 5.10a - The Roof Pitch: Follow the cracks/corner up to a excellent hand crack corner roof (a short fun move over); continue up alongside the block of doom; a solid belay is possible at the top of the block of doom (in cracks to the left of the block).    Be wary of the block doom as it is HUGE and seems to be detached and ready to release.  The rockfall appears to be from 2008    P5- 45m - 5.10c - The Dihedral Pitch: Pull a second roof directly from the belay and follow up and over into a corner ledge that leads to the dihedral.  An interesting (short) traverse down puts you under a dirty looking dihedral (it climbs clean), work up through secure but pumpy moves of the dihedral (good pro) (alternatively the right side face of the dihedral goes at 5.11a); continue up easier terrain to a two bolt belay.    P6- 50m - 5.10c - Transition to the Shield: Follow the corner up to the tree (or work a crimp/ledge ladder out left that leads back into the corner tree); head right climbing the face up around the corner (one bolt and sparse/small pro); don't forget to look over/around the corner for the chicken head saviors; finish up the face of the Shield through easy chicken head terrain (two bolts spaced wildly apart and maybe a slung chicken head) to a two bolt belay at a tree.    P7- 25m - 5.7 - The Mini Dihedral: Follow a short but beautiful little left-facing dihedral with a 2"" crack in the back of it that leads directly to the left most end of Library Ledge; two bolt belay.    Most parties will follow the last two pitches (68 meters) of Outerspace from hear.    P8- 55m - 5.10b A0 - Continue up the 5.10b slab climbing (sparse? bolts) from the left side of Library Ledge to a bolt ladder.

Orbit,106768055,Trad,105792154,5.8+,800,7,3.3,139.0,"Orbit is probably the second-most popular route on Snow Creek Wall, and is regarded to have a more airy, exposed feel.  Although the climbing is technically more moderate than Outer Space, the combination of exposure, route-finding challenges, and the occasional runout section combine to provide a spicy feel beyond the grade.    With the exception of pitch 1, all pitches put your climber out of line-of-sight, and out of earshot.    Pitch 0: 5.6, 180 feet. Scramble up to the large tree slightly right of the Mary Jane dihedral. Move left and enter a 4th class gully. Follow this up toward the distinctive 'hanging' tree at the top. Sling the flake and/or the tree.  (Some route descriptions omit this pitch, or call it the scramble to the first belay station.)    Pitch 1: 5.8+, 90 feet. Move right of the tree to the main ledge and proceed up corners and slabs to the crux of this pitch, an 'awkward' roof which can be negotiated via the slab on the left, or stemming high and pulling over the roof.  Once past this, climb 30 easy feet to a small ledge directly below the Mary Jane dihedral.    Pitch 2: 5.8 - 5.9, 150 feet. Find the easy overhung traverse moving left and up at a diagonal.  After 90 feet or so, you'll find yourself at the foot of a fantastic 5.9 finger crack system which presents the technical crux of the pitch, in the form of another 'awkward' transition leftward when the finger crack system peters out.   Set belay on the ramp with bushes above the finger crack, and chill in the slot behind the large flake. (an alternate to the crack system is to continue traversing left, then climb up low-fifth class blocks to the belay).    Pitch 3: 5.8+, 180 feet. Take an airy, exposed step up and right to a slab which progresses about 40 feet up to a roof.  Clip the bolt, skip the buttonhead, and when the slab begins to roof out, move right around the arete.    If the fingercracks of the prior pitch are the technical crux of the route, the face climbing above the arête in this pitch are the mental crux.  Proceed directly up the face (small cams for pro here) through some fun mantling moves to a dihedral with a small ledge and vertical and horizontal cracks.  This will be your most-exposed feeling belay station.    Pitch 4: 5.8, 90 feet. From your belay, climb straight up the dihedral. When crack in the corner runs out, move up and to the right to gain the knobby face, and marvel at the beginning of a sea of chickenheads.  Pull over an easy roof and continue up the 5.5 face to the large ledge with an overhanging roof and obvious right ramp.  Belay from the ledge.    Pitch 5: 5.6, 200 feet. Move up the ramp on the right side of the ledge and marvel at the endless chickenheads in front of you.  Pro is very sparse- sling the occasional chickenhead- and move generally left, following the easiest path. Climbing will become progressively easier from here, and eventually you'll reach 3rd-class jumbles of blocks- go as far as you have rope and set belay.    Pitch 6: low 5th, 150 feet. Climb generally up and left toward the top, then head right up one of the gullies to the sandy summit.     Descent: From the summit, move left to find the cairn-marked descent trail, which will lead you across the top of the gully at the base of the wall and onto the rib across from the wall.  Take a moment to enjoy the view, and follow the cairn-trail down.  Some of this will be 4th class scrambing but if done right will not require a rappel.   Near the bottom, enter a narrow gully and work left (back toward your packs).  A short scramble (watch for the cairns!) over a fin ridge will gain you the flank at the foot of the wall- continue down and left until you reach your starting point.  If you proceed too far, you'll be cliffed out.","{107123122: 4, 107616008: 4, 106455351: 4, 106871882: 4, 106486749: 4, 12522: 4, 107167101: 4, 106420562: 4, 105939248: 4, 108197152: 4, 106670517: 4, 106257649: 4, 107103608: 4, 107919778: 4, 106423680: 4, 106054402: 4, 108583043: 4, 106420487: 4, 110838803: 4, 108797654: 4, 107147681: 4, 109037301: 4, 107715396: 4, 110828030: 4, 106588555: 4, 107280303: 4, 109541594: 4, 111925753: 4, 108308457: 4, 108177262: 4, 111151945: 4, 106591608: 4, 106940732: 4, 112041304: 4, 110838115: 4, 111076967: 4, 107394785: 4, 111777299: 4, 113374239: 4, 110459899: 4, 108279275: 4, 200173746: 4, 107640602: 4, 112330735: 4, 107866588: 4, 112096766: 4, 200170248: 4, 200111249: 4, 112990119: 4, 200176344: 4, 107395651: 4, 112386169: 4, 200259209: 4, 105949294: 4, 200219172: 4, 200188254: 4, 200382803: 4, 200155440: 4, 200899747: 4, 200177081: 4, 107230627: 3, 106301735: 3, 106158624: 3, 106531787: 3, 106186551: 3, 106848900: 3, 107316089: 3, 106347294: 3, 108232388: 3, 108282289: 3, 107432344: 3, 108257678: 3, 106785541: 3, 105801073: 3, 107684440: 3, 108066294: 3, 109969730: 3, 107497633: 3, 109297082: 3, 107176647: 3, 109518612: 3, 109140657: 3, 107435323: 3, 107998332: 3, 108759454: 3, 109199215: 3, 107995117: 3, 111361513: 3, 108425059: 3, 106210225: 3, 110547057: 3, 109801358: 3, 108302681: 3, 110494482: 3, 112854549: 3, 111704014: 3, 200070835: 3, 108161621: 3, 110103936: 3, 110669338: 3, 112461680: 3, 109431904: 3, 108212790: 3, 106838734: 3, 112515132: 3, 200406922: 3, 111760503: 3, 107412430: 3, 200464028: 3, 110839245: 3, 107537378: 3, 106418002: 3, 200333628: 3, 110818266: 3, 105832216: 3, 200351166: 3, 200507898: 3, 111003201: 3, 200439310: 3, 106052225: 2, 106892642: 2, 107083315: 2, 107118298: 2, 108967968: 2, 107870705: 2, 110158247: 2, 111643513: 2, 107603653: 2, 109514934: 2, 110753518: 2, 111843544: 2, 108091988: 2, 111801079: 2, 109371456: 2, 200184723: 2, 7016231: 2, 106604572: 1, 105978184: 1}"
Outer Space,105793664,Trad,105792154,5.9,700,6,3.8,583.0,"Probably the most popular route in Leavenworth. Starts at the base of Snow Creek Wall and follows fantastic features up through the main shield to the top. This can be crowded, but it's a good place to chill and look at the view. Pretty easy to identify this route on the wall, because of the long, well-cleaned crack splitting the upper headwall. Follow that crack down to a ledge with a big cedar growing out of it. The regular start is the ledge/dihedral system about 80 feet right and 100 feet down from the end of that ledge.P1-P2 (5.7): An easy corner/scramble to a ledge. From the ledge, traverse down and left to the huge ledge with the big tree; you'll probably have to do a little easy simulclimbing to do this as one pitch. There's also several fun variations starting further left that are a bit harder, but would allow you to pass a really slow party on the first pitch.P3 (5.9): From the ledge, either head up a steep crack with juggy flakes (some are a bit hollow) or start from the left up a dihedral. Either way, you end up at a roof. Step out to the right (this is airy and fun, with great pro) and follow the crack out right until it heads up again. Be careful of drag. Belay on a nice sloping ledge. P4 (5.8). Head up and left on an easy slab peppered with knobs toward a right-facing dihedral. Get into the dihedral (crux of this pitch), top out, and traverse left to another ledge. Watch out for rope drag on this, too. Longer than it looks.P5 (5.7). The money pitch. Go up the obvious crack that splits the shield. One of the most enjoyable pitches in the world, I think. You'll giggle the whole way up. It's 130 feet long (?). You can jam in any of the bomber, perfect jams along the way, or if you get tired of that, step onto the stair-like knobs peppering the face. Sublime. And it ends on a perfect ledge with a separate crack to set an anchor. Gear wise might want to bring triples in hand size as its easy to run out of gear here P6 (5.9). Keep following the crack. A little ""bouldery"" crack move gets you off the ledge, then it's cruiser jamming to the top. Getting all the way to the top in one pitch from here will stretch a 60m rope. You may have to stop on the slab to bring up your second before you actually hit the top and trees. Don't sweat it, though. There's room for gear everywhere.From here, there is a rap route, or scramble down the gullies on the left (as you're facing the wall). Follow the cairns all the way (well marked).  Once you hit the tree rappel station there is an option of continuing to walk off (much easier IMO), just continue to follow the cairns","{11323: 4,

The meat of the climbing is steep crack climbing on a gorgeous panel of granite soaring off of Aasgard Pass on the NE side of the mountain. After topping out the hard climbing a further 1500' of 5th class scrambling leads to the top.    The first two ascents added 2 pitches below the approach ramp but these are not commonly climbed.    Start off on 5th class slab and make your way to the base of the first pitch, a hand crack in darker rock    P1 5.10a    From a sloping stance, climb the hand crack which turns to lower angle fists and then climbs left to a single bolt belay.

Step right to a stance high up on the pitch after fun double hand cracks.    P3 5.9   From the stance head left into a flare.  After mantelling the flare a nice flake gives access to a nice ledge underneath the crux.    P4 5.12a   Head up the left side of the pillar and mantel it.  Scope out the moves, place a bomber cam, and fire off a few face moves to get into a finger crack heading into a tight corner.  Not a long pitch but is it short enough?      The Headwall 5.11   Move the belay up to the next ledge underneath an imposing white headwall.  This can be done in anywhere from 1-3 pitches but any belays will be hanging belays.  There are 3 cruxes, one at a big low roof, a double crack crux, and the final roof 20 feet from the finish.  Just enough lichen on this pitch to keep it interesting.    You can rap from here with 2 X 60M ropes, or continue up the Northeast Buttress.  Climb up and right from the belay for maybe 30-40 meters until you can spot a ramp system on the left (Ramp trends right).  Follow this ramp for 1000+ feet, only turning left 30M from the summit around a pillar.

"This, My Friend",119518502,Trad,106015951,5.9+,900,5,4.0,6.0,"Overview900+ feet of quality, sustained crack (and some face) climbing on very good rock, up the elegant East Face of the NE Towers of Dragontail Peak. This climb offers a real alpine climbing experience with long pitches and no fixed protection or anchors, engaging and playful movement, at a surprising and unusually-accessible grade. It takes a natural line up a relatively less explored aspect of one of the most prominent peaks in the range, with a nice position and a friendly scramble descent. The route has comfortable belay ledges approximately every 55 meters, and is in the sun from early morning until early afternoon.Established over the 2nd week of August, 2020 by Andy and Katherine Wyatt, Chris Potts, and Margot Fahey. The first climb of the route (by Andy and Chris) was an onsight, ground-up, and C2C ascent. Later in the week, Andy, Katherine, Chris, and Margo returned for multiple days and rigorously cleaned the route. Regardless, the route remains a true alpine endeavor that requires careful travel and consideration. Note: The E and NE aspects of Dragontail (including the NE Towers) terminate into the E summit of Dragontail. This is atop Dragons of Eden, and the other routes on the east half of the mountain. The East summit is separated from the main summit by a long serrated ridge. Conceivably, one could traverse the ridge connecting the East summit and the main summit (this may or may not have been done before). While not the termination of this route, the highest summit can be reached by descending off the E summit (see descent notes) and ascending the southern slopes via 3rd and 4th class scrambling.RouteP1, 5.9+, 58M. Ascend fifty feet of easy climbing, climb ten feet of face around the right side of a recessed pod, and then back into the main crack. Punch up the main crack, with some smaller over lapping cracks, offering very fun and engaging movement. Atop the main crack, continue through broken and moderate terrain to the obvious ledge and climb 20 feet beyond the right of the two tree/bushes. Belay on .1-.3 cams and small nuts at the base of the beautiful corner above. Note, this pitch protects well using slightly more thoughtful placements relative to the other pitches on the route; all 5.9 moves could be pulled through on gear. P2, 5.9, 55M. Stem your way up the initial 10-foot OW pod before launching up a gorgeous and sustained corner crack, offering spectacular and pure crack climbing from locker fingers to perfect hands. This is a powerful pitch that rewards strong arms and good jamming technique. Look for foot features along the way to ease the grade and add more creative movement. When the corner ends, continue up and left approx 20’ and stop at a crack on the right that accepts bomber med-large nuts and cams. P3, 5.6, 45M. Ascend the broken crack system directly above the belay, gaining a sloping ledge beneath a pair of obvious zig-zag cracks. Climb through these zig-zag cracks to a wide and large sandy ledge. Belay in the clean crack in the middle of this ledge. P4, 5.7, 58M. This clean headwall with a splitter crack that catches your eye from the ground is even more spectacular than it looks. Even more defining is the friendly grade and secure climbing, especially for such a dramatic and full pitch. Begin approx 15-20 feet right of the belay and climb easily up the right side of the protruding ear. Move left a few moves along a thin crack rail to gain the main crack, offering phenomenal and varied crack climbing with excellent movement. Take this long pitch up and slightly right to a large, flat ledge. Belay on the right side of the ledge, to the right of the vertical leaning block.  P5, 5.7, 55M. Climb up and left through broken ledges for approx 20 feet gaining a crack that climbs, pleasantly, up the right side of a right facing dark ear feature. Zig zag up and generally left through varied crack systems, face features, knobs, and small ledges. Exit off the left side of the face, turning the corner into a belay alcove approx 20’ below and to the left of the summit pinnacle. DescentAfter summiting, work S and W across broken 3rd and 4th class terrain, slowly losing elevation until you gain a clean gully (approximately 500’ from the final belay station). Descend this to a large and obvious ledge, then scramble SW to walkable terrain, intersecting the standard summit descent to Aasgard Pass. Note, this was the easiest descent found by the FA party, however, many alternatives exist. Walk on cairned, braided and rocky trails to the top of Aasgard Pass.The route is not set up for rappel.","{106458171: 4, 106181408: 4, 200066356: 4, 107862672: 4, 200913726: 4, 107497633: 4}"

Easy ground, class 4 or 5.fun.    p-2: The broken stuff below the big ledge (some call it the dance floor) at the base of the slab, above the lower pitch. Other than one little bit of serpentine, it is easy scramble (depending on water, etc.). Big block at the base to sling as anchor for p-1. Very short pitch.  Might sling one block for protection or place one piece depending on how the scramble looks. Easily combined with pitch 1.    p-3: There are two crack systems (the 5.4 on the left and 5.6 in the middle) heading up. The pitch ends at a ledge on the right of the vertical crack. It is not all that obvious and don't climb all the way to the huge ledge at the top of the face. The ledge fits 3 people if they are friends. 4 if they are really close friends. Two big bolts at the ledge (and there used to be two pitons in the crack above the ledge, only one there now). 60m does not reach on rap  it is about 15 short.      p-4: Lower part is just a continuation of the 3rd pitch. Upper part has a couple of cracks to choose from. The left corner has good protection both in the crack and on the left face. 3 bolts on top, serpentine face to slip on. If people are on rappel, climb the corner to the top.     Do not rappel all the way down to the top of the second pitch from the top of the fourth. Two 60m ropes will make it, but you have a really good chance to get your rope stuck. There is a crack a couple of feet below the top anchor that likes to wedge your rope. Rappelling to the top of the third pitch lessens this risk because the angle is different.","{105816622: 4, 108312429: 4, 106054402: 4, 106531787: 4, 109425462: 4, 110718871: 4, 109361563: 4, 108327867: 4, 108690445: 4, 110460691: 4, 106858993: 4, 110268695: 4, 200067515: 4, 108996515: 4, 111878041: 4, 112426189: 4, 111952749: 4, 111801659: 4, 7042181: 4, 108261733: 4, 200333628: 4, 112266335: 4, 200294153: 4, 7101227: 4, 200601567: 4, 110747087: 4, 107083009: 3, 106394111: 3, 108161621: 3, 108172072: 3, 107083315: 3, 106632496: 3, 108282289: 3, 107616008: 3, 106555971: 3, 106670517: 3, 107517345: 3, 108189067: 3, 108435830: 3, 108210056: 3, 107583198: 3, 105801073: 3, 107022274: 3, 107184171: 3, 108457784: 3, 108267789: 3, 110702810: 3, 107850929: 3, 107460058: 3, 109541594: 3, 107459332: 3, 110404268: 3, 111206285: 3, 109199215: 3, 108662872: 3, 109607807: 3, 110785700: 3, 109037301: 3, 108234286: 3, 111553306: 3, 111151945: 3, 108383947: 3, 108279275: 3, 112990119: 3, 108412656: 3, 200070835: 3, 112108881: 3, 200173746: 3, 107715396: 3, 200063657: 3, 109501699: 3, 200152964: 3, 111357938: 3, 108712081: 3, 112438788: 3, 110669338: 3, 108230515: 3, 200070233: 3, 109662548: 3, 109431904: 3, 200170248: 3, 200176344: 3, 200176646: 3, 109023575: 3, 200086077: 3, 113374239: 3, 110667332: 3, 13713: 3, 200463667: 3, 108254193: 3, 108188122: 3, 200363461: 3, 111671426: 3, 109944544: 3, 200256340: 3, 111472226: 3, 10405: 3, 200259209: 3, 109895944: 3, 200495085: 3, 107737478: 3, 109130005: 3, 200161779: 3, 105946742: 2, 106871882: 2, 108272772: 2, 108302681: 2, 107419430: 2, 108583043: 2, 106426167: 2, 109669699: 2, 107223178: 2, 109356168: 2, 111848823: 2, 106210225: 2, 200134591: 2, 107423457: 2, 106347294: 2, 200029539: 2, 111939238: 2, 111404787: 2, 200602987: 2, 200415681: 1, 200415687: 1}"

Canary,105790788,Trad,114816092,5.8+,300,2,3.3,204.0,"Canary ascends from the right side of Logger's Ledge and reaches the top of Castle Rock in 2 pitches (3 may be necessary with a 50m rope).  A memorable line, Canary combines interesting climbing with terrific exposure.    Approximately 100 feet to the left of Saber, a short section of face climbing leads to a right facing dihedral and a broken crack system that reaches the left side of Saber ledge.  This is the start of Canary.    P1.  Begin by climbing approximately 15 feet of unprotected face to the base of a right facing dihedral.  This section is not trivial, but the holds are positive and it is no harder than 5.7.  Alternatively, it may be possible to begin in a small dihedral to the left and traverse right to gain the crack system at the top of the face.  From the top of the face, follow the dihedral and subsequent crack systems up with good gear.  Ascend until you are under the giant roof, then break right onto Saber ledge at the top of the crack system.  This pitch is the technical crux of the climb, culminating in the moves up and onto Saber Ledge (5.8).  Belay from gear or the giant eyebolts on the right of Saber Ledge.    P2.  From Saber ledge, contemplate what lies ahead.  The second pitch begins with instant exposure, and the airy step off Saber ledge may be the pyschological crux of the climb.  Begin by traversing obvious holds leading left and slightly up from Saber ledge.  Though intimidating, the traverse is easier than it looks, and giant holds await you on the arete.  It is possible to protect the traverse with a reasonable small alien on the face, otherwise it may be possible to place large gear (with long slings!) above Saber ledge before beginning.  Upon reaching the arete, climb past two bolts and follow your nose and your gear on increasingly easier climbing to the top of the formation.  Like many routes on upper Castle, the exact line is not obvious; expect some runouts on easier terrain. We were able to reach the summit with a 60m rope; a 50m would be somewhat short.    To descend, follow the trail off the back of the summit to Logger's Ledge.","{15023: 4, 14568: 4, 105920392: 4, 107529159: 4, 105789175: 4, 107616008: 4, 106257649: 4, 106228825: 4, 107323239: 4, 106210225: 4, 106918913: 4, 105946742: 4, 10431: 4, 107919778: 4, 106253591: 4, 107827482: 4, 106555971: 4, 106865703: 4, 107821622: 4, 108288200: 4, 107002071: 4, 107445995: 4, 109607807: 4, 106008830: 4, 109969730: 4, 110621311: 4, 107847782: 4, 108348917: 4, 109037301: 4, 107715396: 4, 109004199: 4, 108457522: 4, 110158247: 4, 105960937: 4, 109258388: 4, 111531597: 4, 108778861: 4, 107591659: 4, 108261065: 4, 111453655: 4, 200070835: 4, 108852723: 4, 107528726: 4, 107640602: 4, 108401438: 4, 112330735: 4, 200276478: 4, 112026181: 4, 112990119: 4, 112374839: 4, 200059845: 4, 200357245: 4, 110797288: 4, 200248588: 4, 200337416: 4, 110098525: 4, 107394785: 4, 109023575: 4, 200349287: 4, 200267852: 4, 106839321: 4, 200152964: 4, 200429796: 4, 109516598: 4, 200174092: 4, 200118368: 4, 110331339: 4, 110752881: 4, 200762782: 4, 112128100: 4, 109512488: 4, 200850468: 4, 106834150: 3, 105790762: 3, 12522: 3, 105792055: 3, 107552570: 3, 15116: 3, 107620610: 3, 107071499: 3, 107442878: 3, 105866966: 3, 14977: 3, 107153125: 3, 107621794: 3, 107317697: 3, 106158624: 3, 106320376: 3, 106243972: 3, 105939248: 3, 106868458: 3, 106887229: 3, 105887867: 3, 106486749: 3, 106052225: 3, 107036937: 3, 106347294: 3, 106569451: 3, 107054992: 3, 107266672: 3, 107083009: 3, 108282289: 3, 108232388: 3, 108255529: 3, 108390975: 3, 106670517: 3, 108257678: 3, 108236993: 3, 107118298: 3, 107083315: 3, 108161621: 3, 108671904: 3, 109166530: 3, 108552057: 3, 109265982: 3, 109899776: 3, 108173400: 3, 108266997: 3, 107147681: 3, 108380104: 3, 107195648: 3, 106054402: 3, 111038971: 3, 107435323: 3, 107280303: 3, 108308457: 3, 107910140: 3, 108279275: 3, 110923255: 3, 111871657: 3, 107497633: 3, 109638995: 3, 106940732: 3, 108984178: 3, 109177262: 3, 107998332: 3, 111848823: 3, 110718871: 3, 111766327: 3, 111112991: 3, 107469950: 3, 110253489: 3, 111841723: 3, 111841326: 3, 108864561: 3, 110547057: 3, 113374239: 3, 112106313: 3, 110459899: 3, 111037277: 3, 109514934: 3, 112461680: 3, 111700011: 3, 111720713: 3, 200173746: 3, 112096766: 3, 109501699: 3, 200063657: 3, 109541958: 3, 110454747: 3, 200161465: 3, 108212790: 3, 107185927: 3, 110457315: 3, 106666369: 3, 108302681: 3, 109431904: 3, 112063590: 3, 200350043: 3, 200176344: 3, 109140657: 3, 11802: 3, 200259209: 3, 200086652: 3, 106945872: 3, 200455940: 3, 112084481: 3, 112225815: 3, 107928271: 3, 108980384: 3, 200296165: 3, 10544: 3, 111003201: 3, 200176751: 3, 112008242: 3, 107768941: 3, 200778127: 3, 200226837: 3, 108425059: 3, 107300354: 2, 106394111: 2, 106987860: 2, 106423443: 2, 106848900: 2, 110114491: 2, 109205663: 2, 107735421: 2, 107870705: 2, 111409856: 2, 112252463: 2, 109199215: 2, 200415681: 2, 200392723: 2}"

Rainshadow Direct,109817765,Sport,114816092,5.12b,100,1,3.6,5.0,"Perhaps the ""hardest"" route at Castle Rock, Rainshadow Direct had gone though a complex history to become the classic sport climb that it is today.     Originally a 2-pitch A3 aid climb put up by Fred Beckey, Eric Bjornstad, and Jim Stuart, it was freed during the great Ltown renaissace of the mid-80's by Gred Child, Matt Kerns, and Jim Yoder. Former PNW crusher Kyle O'Meara envisioned a direct start up beautiful white rock which would allow the route to be climbed in one pitch. Unfortunatly, Kyle ran out of bolts, and was only able to sink in the first three. Nonetheless it didnt keep Kyle from freeing the line with a stick clip to start and traditional pro (a few cams and a sea of manky fixed pins) through the upper crux bulge. This half-finished pseudo-""traditional"" version saw possibly just one additional free ascent over the next few years. In the spring of 2014, Dave Morales, added the missing couple of bolts to the direct start, replaced the manky fixed pins through the upper crux with bolts, and added a lower 2-bolt anchor.     The route begins with beautiful climbing using perfect edges and side-pulls on aesthetic white stone. From a midway rest ledge a perplexing bouldery crux leads to a more moderate finish up a shallow corner system.","{106304758: 4, 110752881: 4, 200762782: 4, 15043: 3, 109780534: 3}"

Look for a left angling ramp just to the right of a large, low roof.  This is the start of Saber.    P1.  Climb the left angling ramp to the base of a left facing dihedral.  The rock in the dihedral has been polished to a slippery, disconcerting, mirror-like sheen.  When you hit a diaganol crack heading up to the left follow it to Saber ledge.  Belay from bolts. (~90 feet)    P2.  A few easy moves (~5.5) on the left side of a wide chimney take you up onto emminently forgettable and blocky terrain.  The climbing gets easier as you ascend, and I found myself on 4th or 3rd class terrain long before reaching the top of Castle rock (~190 feet).    I've stuck with the historical rating for this climb, which may be a bit of a sandbag-- a more realistic rating for the first pitch may be 5.6.  Combined with the polished rock, this route is probably not the best choice for a fledgling trad leader.

The Ascentionist,114778289,Sport,105792216,5.10b/c,580,6,2.9,27.0,"I believe this project started one desperate rainy day march 2017. Too wet to do ANYTHING, but the stoke was high. Kyle touted ""i want to do something stupid"". I had it in the back of my mind that this wall existed, but never had a reason to explore. We went out armed for bear, full double rack, aid kit and a hammer drill. We were going to siege our way up the wall in the rain. A couple hrs later and out of rivets the first pitch was done... Over the course of the summer we would go out and chip away at a pitch, limited by the battery life of the drill (hand drilling in this rock was crazy, way more effort than granite it seemed). Most of the rack was left on the ground after pitch 2. I daisy whipped on a #2 and had it pull, tomahawking backwards through the moss for 40 ft. With full aid kit and the drill in hand it was an entertaining fall. We eventually made it up the wall 5.9 A2+ R. (side note: if some of the bolting seems weird, many bolts were placed on aid lead through a blanket of gravel and moss so...) So then commenced the absurd task of cleaning this wall. Hundreds of hrs went into cleaning it to the state that its in. We had caution tape up for quite a while and gated off nevermind on days we were planning to release big stuff. Most of the climbing is surprisingly fun, some being legitimately wild. Be prepared for some post cleaning dirt and the potential for holds to pull. Overall the route cleaned up fairly well, but until this thing sees a lot of ascents rockfall may still be commonplace. Bring a hardhat!    P1- 120ft 5.8/9 13 bolts. Up the left facing corner to the massive roof, traverse left past the roof then up the face to a sloping ledge with chains. P2- 110ft 10b 14 bolts. boulder problem to the right of the belay takes you up the groove, slab up to a broken face, easy climbing to a big ledge with rap chains, step right stem off tree, steep moves up (crux) then left past some more broken rock. Belay at a stance, 2 bolts no chain. P3- 100ft 10b 13 bolts (money pitch), traverse right from the belay to some yellow rock, mantle to a sloping ledge, then wild moves to initiate a traverse back left to a big ledge with a belay. P4- 60ft 5.8/9 6 bolts. straight up the face to a ledge with a tree, 3 bolt anchor (1 damaged 1 wire hanger 1 good). P5- 130ft 5.9+ 12 bolts. Up the easy face to a slab with an easy runout to a ledge (optional belay here to do 4,5,6 as 2 pitches) pull some steep moves off the ledge and traverse a massive dike right to a huge ledge with an anchor. (do not rap here, else you want to adventure through choss land!) P6- 60ft 5.9 5 bolts, steep moves off the belay, up and left to the top.

There are also currently 12 anchors up there of various types. If it's not a bolted anchor, a quicklink/webbing is available for you to use your own rope. Some anchors have fixed lines. This description is to help you find your way and nail the route you’re trying to climb. All of the rappel sites are tagged with orange tape / sharpie.The access for Darkside is the same, just continue to the right above the crag.WAYNE’S WORLDOnce at the crag, go all the way to the left, past Schwing Left. You’ll eventually see a way up to the top on your right. Go up and across the exposed gully with a good but exposed ledge. This will bring you to a set of chains and a fixed traverse rope.This set of chains accesses SCHWING LEFT by rappelling straight down through the tree opening. The anchor in the middle of the traverse accesses PARTY ON WAYNE down left, and THE ASPIRANT to the right.Continuing on, clip the traverse rope and scramble across the crazy tree. Rope tied to bolts. Unclip once across and walk a ways until you see webbing anchors to your right near the cliff edge.Looking down on the anchors, furthest right is QUARANTINE with fixed orange rope, rappels approx 20' to bolted anchor.Blue webbing, yellow cord and a fixed line accesses IMPERIAL MARCH on rappel left, and HIGHSTEPPING FOR JESUS on rappel right.Black static rope with quicklink access to COLD THERAPY on right. PAINTED RUINS lower down and on the left.9/16” Red supertape webbing with quicklink raps to PARTYTIME!EXCELLENT! under the roof....and should also reach SOCIAL DISTANCING on rap left. CRAG DADDY may also be accessed from this anchor. 1” red webbing accesses CRAG DADDY by rappelling down and left. If desired (not recommended due to the chossy gully) you can access CHEWBACCEROTICA by moving the anchor and rappelling down and right around the tree.DARKSIDEThe next rope traverse down the gully of trees take you to DARKSIDE. Be careful unclipping the traverse rope, you are above a little cliff. From the end on the traverse rope, rappel down to the leaning cedar for LOG RIDE! Continuing on, go left, then an exposed step right takes you down to an exposed anchor tree. Rappel down and rap left over and against a log for DINGLEBERRIES OF EDEN. Rappel straight down for VADER BUILT MY HOTROD.IT’S A TRAP is accessed by using the same anchor as DOE and VBMH, but you need to swing hard to the right along the ledge. Be careful of the swing with your rope over the edge.The only route that you can actually access the route anchor is JIJI'S CHIMNEY. Walk down to skiers left, around a rock face. The anchor is to the left.  Further right and up a rock/dirt step is a white fixed line on a tree. Clip into the rope which is tied to the chain anchor. This anchor accesses  REPUBLICAN JESUS and PINA COLADAS WITH PALPATINE.  ALPINE CORNER is to the right,  has not been developed, has loose blocks and is not recommended. ","{200337960: 4, 108134776: 4, 108177328: 3}"

It is very unique for the formation and area and in my humble opinion, an excellent adventure. The route follows a series of cracks through 3 increasingly large, difficult, left trending roofs to a bolted anchor at the top. It can be done in 1-3 pitches depending on one’s comfort level with the grade and spacing of protection. On the first ascent, we climbed it in 2 pitches. The first pitch follows the lovely right trending flake (10b) through the first, small roof, pulling through the left side. This leads to easier terrain past the old raptor nest underneath the 2nd, large, left trending roof. Work through a surprisingly good, well protected roof crack to easier terrain (11b). You can build an anchor anywhere above the 2nd roof or use the slung block. If you’ve had enough, you can rap from the block but if you want more, the 3rd roof offers a puzzling, 3D boulder problem and the crux of the route (11c). Continue up and left, following features and cracks skirting the overhanging chimney on its outside edge. Once you reach the left edge of the 3rd roof, step out right to a small sloping foot ledge and blindly paw at some features above to reach the bolted anchors. This series of moves is very exposed and is protected by some very small cams! EXCITING! A 60M, partially free-hanging rappel gets you to the bottom.  This route has taken myself and a close group of friends years to piece together. Big thanks to Chris Hagen for many adventures, lots of scouting, and hard work. This would not have been possible without you. And to all the others who helped support the increasing obsession, thank you.   There are features that look unstable, like the raptor nest under the 2nd roof, or the block under the 3rd roof, but I assure you, the rock is quite solid. The protection is quite ample and very good. I recall my exploratory leads allowed me to place gear almost every 4 or 5 feet so if this grade feels a bit out of reach for you, as it did for me, trust that you can protect it well.  Note: this route is mostly protected by the rain due to the overhanging nature of the climb. There are some seeps, but otherwise can be climbed during times of light precipitation. The first ascent was done between showers!",{107372505: 4}

Infinite Bliss,108170867,Trad,108170864,5.10c,2600,23,2.7,43.0,"Infinite Bliss is a super fun 23-pitch bolted route in a beautiful setting. While it was quite controversial when first established and there was talk of chopping the line, it has become an enjoyable line that appears is here to stay.     This route is not a sport climb. It is a bolt-protected slab climb, and it is extremely long which means you need to be quick and efficient. In fact, it's quite possible it's the longest bolted climb in the USA and Canada and the second longest in North America. There are sections where runouts can top 100 feet with little to no options for trad gear. However, any move harder than 5.6 is well protected, and the crux pitches are fully-bolted sport pitches.    The ""parking lot"" and approach is at N47.54604, W121.52151, Elevation: 1174'. Simply copy and paste the GPS coordinates, excluding the elevation, into Google Maps and it will tell you how to get there. From the parking lot, the approach is about 45 minutes long and is mostly uphill through switchbacks in the forest. While the trail was not explicitly marked when I climbed the route, it is worn enough that if you are hiking more than a few minutes and it does not look like you are on a trail, you are off route.    Pitches 1 - 7: These pitches involves easy, low-angle, somewhat runout climbing on solid slab. The rock can be a bit water-polished. Be careful if there are parties above you because if they knock rock down the rock will blast right through the first six pitches at triple digit speeds. Numerous bent hangers on these pitches are obvious indicators of the rock fall hazard. If you are confident simulclimbing 5.8, the first six pitches are the place to do it.    Pitches 8 - 12: The rock starts to steepen here, but the pitches become more closely bolted as the moves get harder.    Pitches 13 - 18: Mostly easy climbing. The most runout section is in here. Be very careful not to knock loose rock down on climbers below as the rock quality in this section is fair in some areas. Dont feel bad if you dont find the bolts on P15 as I missed both of them. P16 and 17 have no pro aside from the belay station. The climbing is very easy, but the rock quality is fair and the rock tends to be slightly polished, so be careful.    Pitches 19 - 23: These are the hardest pitches, but they are mostly sport-bolted pitches. Both of the 5.10 pitches are well bolted.    For more info, Google Infinite Bliss. Summit Post has a nice write-up on the route. You can find a topo here: cascadeclimbers.com/forum/u…    WARNING: Rock fall is a serious concern here. Wear a helmet, and once you pass pitch six, be extremely careful not to knock loose rock down on other climbers. The entire route follows a gully slab, and if you knock rock down it will have nowhere to go but right along the route the entire way.

Preiss Route,119496583,Trad,108170864,5.8+,1700,13,2.0,1.0,"In mid-July 1999 I was under the west peak of Mt Garfield, in the woods, trying to find the beginning of the rock wall. After traversing in from the trees, left of the rock wall, I gained the large ledge with a weak waterfall on its left side and an obvious stair stepped rock “gully” next to the waterfall. I then made a few difficult, (for me) un-roped moves just below and right of the obvious stair stepped rock. After approx. 70-100ft of climbing the easier “stairs”, I set up my first belay. The belay was in the first crack I came too, on the right side of the “staircase”. After rappelling and retrieving my pack I re-climbed the pitch. At the belay and staying on self-belay I exited the stairs, moving out right slightly to a long pitch with some fun 5.8-9 slabby rock with a few good cracks/pockets to add protection. After A full pitch I reached a shelf with a couple small pools of water on it. After retrieving my pack I went up, angling left, climbing easier rock un-roped until I reached the base of the great slabs. I then climbed sub-par 4th-5.0 class rock un-roped, which seemed like awhile (6-700 feet?), eventually aiming for a small, thick stubby tree on the upper right side of the face. From here I self-belayed out of the tree via a few fun moves and went on to the next small tree patch. After retrieving my pack I decided to bivi here. It was only around 6:30-7pm but I felt like resting some. The tree patch had a few small trees and sandy ground, but was tilted and not very comfortable. Looking back I should have went one more pitch and got to the large shelf below the upper head wall. But at the time I didn’t think of it and I can’t remember if I could even see it from where I was. I didn’t bring a stove so I ate my cold sandwich and tried to sleep. I awoke at 4am and started climbing at 4:30. Still un-roped, I climbed strait up the slabby rock. I reached the large ledge soon. When on the large shelf below the steeper head wall, I traversed it to its left side and self-belayed a fun (5.7) blocky corner. This pitch ended at a small sandy notch. After retrieving my pack I continued self- belayed up from the notch via a few thin moves (5.9+) with a solid thin crack for protection. After these few moves I reached easier rock on the rib. I un roped and continued up easy rock until I reached what looked like my last obstacle, a rock wall of maybe 60-80 feet. I tried it free solo with the rope in my pack but I felt it was little hard at the time, and I didn’t want to do something stupid, so I broke out the rope again. It seemed it was in the 5.8/9ish range with good protection. Then I was finished. I walked a little bit down and left through a small gap in the trees to the gentle northern slopes, then walked right 40-50 feet and climbed the back side of the final 30 foot summit rock. It was 12:30pm. little did I know I would miss work the next day as I had a mini epic descent, but that’s another story.  I belayed 4-5 harder pitches (5.7-9 with good pro) out of approx 14-16(?) pitches.",{200899747: 2}

It is exposed and dries quickly, and is climbable in low temps.","{11323: 4, 105805797: 4, 105855165: 4, 106116385: 4, 107497633: 4, 106347294: 4, 106859002: 4, 105887231: 4, 105898385: 4, 105805486: 4, 106054402: 4, 105886042: 4, 106420562: 4, 106353545: 4, 106670773: 4, 106871882: 4, 106091772: 4, 106389004: 4, 107199645: 4, 108130441: 4, 107240862: 4, 108308935: 4, 108277243: 4, 107653186: 4, 107684440: 4, 108288200: 4, 107919778: 4, 107224861: 4, 106601971: 4, 107616008: 4, 109607807: 4, 108425059: 4, 108208572: 4, 108272772: 4, 108282289: 4, 110886545: 4, 109199215: 4, 109749748: 4, 110931603: 4, 111089796: 4, 108255529: 4, 108302681: 4, 107910140: 4, 109104070: 4, 111863141: 4, 108391837: 4, 111918186: 4, 107137932: 4, 107998332: 4, 112461680: 4, 111737052: 4, 108329246: 4, 112342766: 4, 108267789: 4, 107520318: 4, 109541958: 4, 112060545: 4, 107394785: 4, 111697244: 4, 108243264: 4, 200076183: 4, 200149886: 4, 110103936: 4, 110752881: 4, 108155086: 4, 110335247: 4, 200234374: 4, 107735421: 4, 111190382: 4, 112515241: 4, 107313996: 4, 111149410: 4, 112105443: 4, 106940732: 4, 112022015: 4, 112407400: 4, 110669338: 4, 200170248: 4, 106211971: 4, 105790555: 4, 107734618: 4, 200202760: 4, 110575679: 4, 112096766: 4, 106738886: 4, 200437434: 4, 110942763: 4, 200337416: 4, 111878041: 4, 200173746: 4, 200043948: 4, 108226968: 4, 107603653: 4, 110331339: 4, 7045943: 4, 200174092: 4, 110522591: 4, 107346586: 4, 108163249: 4, 107537378: 4, 108984178: 4, 111903811: 4, 200296165: 4, 106370309: 4, 200405696: 4, 200195788: 4, 108752039: 4, 200267777: 4, 200177081: 4, 108175696: 4, 111658578: 4, 112089625: 4, 112515132: 4, 200240941: 4, 200637145: 4, 107395651: 4, 200493116: 4, 200093609: 4, 200446052: 4, 111859201: 4, 14308: 4, 200218720: 4, 110873869: 4, 200137514: 4, 200227081: 4, 108353227: 4, 200033657: 4, 200574310: 4, 200075170: 4, 105849121: 3, 15043: 3, 107043617: 3, 107303640: 3, 106041637: 3, 106104499: 3, 106348322: 3, 105805707: 3, 106423680: 3, 105805288: 3, 106511884: 3, 106210225: 3, 106558409: 3, 106257649: 3, 106666369: 3, 105829612: 3, 107618213: 3, 108302178: 3, 107935774: 3, 107184171: 3, 106910356: 3, 107552170: 3, 109037301: 3, 108552057: 3, 107078873: 3, 108066294: 3, 106200072: 3, 107886361: 3, 109749744: 3, 108755823: 3, 107995117: 3, 107457259: 3, 107776727: 3, 107083315: 3, 111048976: 3, 111415956: 3, 110248120: 3, 106239028: 3, 106319993: 3, 111624139: 3, 109899776: 3, 109139853: 3, 107435323: 3, 109313896: 3, 108029322: 3, 109213362: 3, 111409856: 3, 109549919: 3, 107003581: 3, 110547057: 3, 108730433: 3, 108864561: 3, 112475989: 3, 112092976: 3, 107147681: 3, 107647261: 3, 112856061: 3, 107260705: 3, 106646308: 3, 106670517: 3, 200091758: 3, 107640602: 3, 109514934: 3, 106489329: 3, 107185927: 3, 109431904: 3, 200240855: 3, 200176344: 3, 107290679: 3, 108744718: 3, 108839199: 3, 110125834: 3, 200452490: 3, 112376780: 3, 200504665: 3, 200468347: 3, 106838734: 3, 200386343: 3, 200259209: 3, 109141848: 3, 108824777: 3, 110220193: 3, 106418002: 3, 107747710: 3, 112263554: 3, 112008242: 3, 110747087: 3, 110818266: 3, 112134112: 3, 200569620: 3, 106890504: 2, 106158624: 2, 107793366: 2, 106558554: 2, 10168: 2, 112204075: 2, 200192115: 2, 106920443: 2, 106449525: 2, 200455682: 2}"

To the right of this flake notice the ledge going across to the right, about 20-feet up. (The ledge become a large ramp on the right-most side where it intersects the hillside.) The first pitch starts at the two-bolt anchor about 1/3 of the way across this ledge.     To reach the start, you have a few choices. The easiest is to hike up the trail to the left of the ledge and then walk out the ledge. Some parties may not want a rope to get to the bolted anchor, but if the ledge is wet, it might be nice to have a short belay.    P1: (5.8+) Climb up the corner past a bolt to a long ledge. Traverse to the left end of the ledge, where you will find a bolted belay by the tree. Uses face and layback moves plus the occasional jam. Protects well with nuts and cams.    P2: (5.9) Continue directly up the corner and then up an easier flake section. This pitch can take big gear to protect the easier section, but cams to 3"" would be fine for those comfortable at the grade. The moves between the corner and the crack/flake above can be hard.    P3: (5.9)Head left and then up a crack to bolts at the top.     A fun variation is to follow the crack up and right from the belay (Heart of the Country, 10b).     Descent: Rap the route.

(Itself a fun route) There should be an anchor at the base of the route. Move left and follow knobs up a steep wall. Typical Index knob climbing. The crux is passing a bulging section around the 3rd bolt. The bolt is close but care needs to be taken in falling due to the slabby undulating nature of the rock. After this two more bolts lead to an easier crack section (~1.5” cam is used here – 1.5 rigid friend was used on the FA) After passing another bolt a traversing crack system leads  left (gear needed here)  to join the Heart of the Country route.,{105949294: 3}

With bad gear below and thin gear protecting you from the ground, this is a heady lead for the grade. Simply put, a more direct, harder, and headier HHHW. Fear not, however, as this variation can be easily top-roped by climbing the safer and easier HHHW.","{110225880: 3, 200447456: 3, 112037761: 2, 112096766: 2, 107995117: 2, 109474977: 2, 200447469: 0}"

Supposedly this route was climbed a long time ago but I cleaned it extensively and it has not been reported officially anywhere. Take it for what it's worth.  Description: Follow the rightward leading hand crack with good protection. Grab face holds when you can and pull up into the crack. Once there, follow the face up to a stance. Here, if you are tall enough you can get a yellow alien in the high crack. If not, you might have to run it out. If so, you're looking at a long fall. It is possible to sling a root at chest height but the FA party didn't so it's up to you. From here, pull the flake with marginal feet up to the next flake, with less marginal feet. Then pull onto the top.  Start with a steep leaning hand crack that brings you to a good stance. From here work in some protection and climb the face on good holds and sloping feet to the anchor above.  The anchor at the top also provides a good TR setup for the classic stemming corner below.","{111972180: 4, 108262531: 3, 112990119: 3, 112161641: 3, 200172145: 3, 109037301: 3, 111149410: 3, 200170248: 3, 110752881: 3, 200357245: 3, 111720713: 3, 107734618: 3, 111311527: 3, 106228825: 3, 111833640: 3, 106920443: 3, 200251962: 3, 200428333: 3, 109541958: 3, 110838115: 3, 111014490: 3, 200614021: 3, 200879043: 3, 106801532: 2, 108279275: 2, 107497633: 2, 109332592: 2, 111282664: 2, 107290679: 2, 200267777: 2, 111832862: 2, 107559987: 2, 200177081: 2, 111788260: 2, 112304988: 2, 109899776: 2, 110669338: 2, 109431904: 2, 112022015: 2, 110225880: 2, 111992286: 2, 111409856: 2, 108234286: 2, 107701685: 2, 200156517: 2, 200071378: 2, 200076183: 2, 200041074: 2, 109023575: 2, 200063657: 2, 112261771: 2, 108041975: 2, 109140657: 2, 111952749: 2, 110747087: 2, 111971885: 2, 112307023: 2, 110956309: 2, 109663557: 2, 106945872: 2, 107083009: 2, 200174092: 2, 106839278: 2, 111112991: 2, 14537: 2, 200243861: 2, 200193992: 2, 110098525: 2, 111972920: 2, 200202760: 2, 200446052: 2, 200070835: 2, 110818266: 2, 106820629: 2, 200184625: 2, 112435288: 2, 200840982: 2, 112134112: 2, 200372264: 2, 110331339: 2, 200351166: 2, 200354210: 2, 200242752: 2, 200008971: 2, 200415681: 2, 109199215: 2, 106666369: 2, 200227081: 2, 200075170: 2, 107995117: 1, 112423707: 1, 107494185: 1, 109607807: 1, 111454181: 1, 108824777: 1, 200580270: 1, 200022936: 1, 110942763: 1, 107798616: 1, 106422836: 0, 106558409: 0}"

You can also approach this from the top of GNS if you don't want to go up Roger's.","{107313996: 4, 11323: 4, 105822381: 4, 105792055: 4, 105789684: 4, 14568: 4, 105936209: 4, 12522: 4, 106158624: 4, 106228825: 4, 106251374: 4, 105896397: 4, 105805486: 4, 105887231: 4, 105916466: 4, 105849353: 4, 106054402: 4, 106871882: 4, 107138006: 4, 106859002: 4, 107290679: 4, 107303640: 4, 107616008: 4, 107919778: 4, 107083315: 4, 107123122: 4, 108277243: 4, 107793366: 4, 106555971: 4, 107653186: 4, 108288200: 4, 107053533: 4, 107224861: 4, 105978184: 4, 108959833: 4, 108552057: 4, 107468926: 4, 106910356: 4, 108282289: 4, 108272772: 4, 109607807: 4, 108779908: 4, 107656938: 4, 108690445: 4, 110927875: 4, 109273711: 4, 107875596: 4, 108268794: 4, 11509: 4, 111588611: 4, 109449620: 4, 106940732: 4, 108308457: 4, 107591659: 4, 107910140: 4, 107616614: 4, 109899776: 4, 109638995: 4, 110966072: 4, 109104070: 4, 107987371: 4, 108967941: 4, 111624139: 4, 107735421: 4, 110752881: 4, 112277189: 4, 105798761: 4, 109241266: 4, 110838115: 4, 112089199: 4, 108425059: 4, 107497633: 4, 110103936: 4, 111847141: 4, 112475989: 4, 200118368: 4, 111938003: 4, 109514934: 4, 108745996: 4, 200173746: 4, 112096766: 4, 106670517: 4, 107640602: 4, 110669338: 4, 109163787: 4, 108442055: 4, 107324472: 4, 112330735: 4, 110335247: 4, 200045829: 4, 11470: 4, 200163353: 4, 200170248: 4, 200192115: 4, 111149410: 4, 200229492: 4, 107346586: 4, 109431904: 4, 109810742: 4, 106821785: 4, 110946269: 4, 107701685: 4, 110098525: 4, 200177081: 4, 112261771: 4, 200063657: 4, 107734618: 4, 111311527: 4, 107916591: 4, 112197815: 4, 200231170: 4, 200259209: 4, 110956309: 4, 200474022: 4, 109828231: 4, 110747087: 4, 107481755: 4, 110324952: 4, 109663557: 4, 200267852: 4, 111643513: 4, 106945872: 4, 200446052: 4, 106907209: 4, 200386343: 4, 107537378: 4, 200022936: 4, 106820629: 4, 110331339: 4, 111263393: 4, 105904743: 4, 111952749: 4, 106418002: 4, 110818266: 4, 200333628: 4, 111658578: 4, 109352136: 4, 111737052: 4, 200292349: 4, 200294153: 4, 200493116: 4, 109018466: 4, 200202760: 4, 110700542: 4, 200191028: 4, 108271128: 4, 200482803: 4, 111146152: 4, 112134112: 4, 108307042: 4, 110320894: 4, 112201590: 4, 200475458: 4, 200455682: 4, 105863172: 3, 106892642: 3, 107684440: 3, 106077459: 3, 106347294: 3, 105805707: 3, 105829740: 3, 106714648: 3, 106486749: 3, 106210225: 3, 106423680: 3, 106455351: 3, 106116385: 3, 106558409: 3, 106531787: 3, 106666369: 3, 107611308: 3, 106214063: 3, 108197152: 3, 107618213: 3, 108308935: 3, 106098789: 3, 108302178: 3, 107118298: 3, 107184171: 3, 108457784: 3, 106569451: 3, 108066294: 3, 107514090: 3, 110114491: 3, 110121607: 3, 107995117: 3, 107715396: 3, 107078873: 3, 106610639: 3, 111048976: 3, 107998332: 3, 108168637: 3, 106420562: 3, 108302681: 3, 106319993: 3, 111151945: 3, 107435323: 3, 107280303: 3, 109199215: 3, 111076967: 3, 110529846: 3, 111003201: 3, 108029322: 3, 108730433: 3, 111206285: 3, 109669699: 3, 106887732: 3, 106679556: 3, 110450256: 3, 111841723: 3, 109037301: 3, 108243264: 3, 107971515: 3, 200070835: 3, 108181716: 3, 111704014: 3, 112856061: 3, 107647261: 3, 108279275: 3, 106859662: 3, 200048015: 3, 107890277: 3, 111992286: 3, 109257815: 3, 106838734: 3, 200248588: 3, 106211971: 3, 108155086: 3, 113398726: 3, 105797778: 3, 200176344: 3, 112105443: 3, 109140657: 3, 110931603: 3, 111971885: 3, 108226968: 3, 110177984: 3, 200161465: 3, 200089065: 3, 200117777: 3, 112161641: 3, 108266997: 3, 111454181: 3, 112528878: 3, 108980384: 3, 111409856: 3, 112263554: 3, 112112035: 3, 108956305: 3, 110248120: 3, 110942763: 3, 112008242: 3, 111415956: 3, 111859201: 3, 107117061: 3, 110873869: 3, 110575679: 3, 200201856: 3, 112207296: 3, 200866724: 3, 200075170: 3, 200176751: 3, 106890504: 2, 106920443: 2, 106848900: 2, 14537: 2, 106713867: 2, 15043: 2, 112515132: 2, 200406922: 2, 108565014: 2, 200236300: 2}"

Climb rightward up a ramp and through some bushes, then straight up an easy ramp to two very large (i.e. 1-inch diameter) bolts. P2 (5.7) Climb up the corner. The 5.7 move is the somewhat awkward move to gain a sloping ledge. Continue up the crack system on the left or the right (technically Pisces), both 5.6, to a belay/rappel station with an overcomplicated set of chains. P3 (5.7+) Either climb up a ramp left and continue up to the top, or go right up another ramp and climb a slabby face to the top. Descent: Rap the route. With 2 60-m ropes, you can reach the ground from the rap station at the top of the second pitch.","{105849353: 4, 105805707: 4, 106714465: 4, 106531787: 4, 106920443: 4, 107138006: 4, 107199645: 4,

Full Horse Power,108852913,Trad,105790707,5.13a,115,1,4.0,4.0,"The original ""Power Horse"" combined Iron Horse up to anchor #1 (5.11d, gear) with the 2nd part of Amandla (5.13c, bolts). The one flaw on this climb is that the anchors are arbitrarily placed on the arete, and the pitch has no logical reason to stop there. It feels a bit weird and lacking to end at the anchor on the arete. If you clip the anchor and climb farther up the arete, and then stem out right, clip one bolt, and pass the roof (on the left, or on the right as per upper Iron Horse) it makes this a much better (and slightly harder) pitch than the original. I'm calling the complete version ""Full Horse Power"" because it has a nice ring to it, but it's really just the logical completion of power horse.     You need a 70m to lower off, but with a shorter rope you can stop at an intermediate and do a second lower.    The hardest sequence is probably the initial span and transfer onto the arete, and the redpoint crux is just after the original Amandla anchor, on the arete. That section is pretty height dependent, but not trivial even if you're tall. Once established on the upper arete under the roof, a series of amazing holds, kneebars, and a couple small pieces of gear get you to the top via rightward or leftward climbing.     Maybe .12c to the original anchors, and .13a for the full? I know a strong local who has sent 5.14 on bolts and gear who says the arete itself is 5.13something.

Bottom: (10b) Start further left, climb the City Park bolt ladder.  Middle: (10a) Right after the flake, go straight up into the corner instead of laybacking out right.  Top: Move left early.

Otherwise, the descent requires two raps to the ground, stopping at the first anchor, or a lower one on the neighboring route.","{106920443: 4, 200357245: 4, 111149410: 4, 200161465: 4, 111357938: 4, 109514934: 4, 108243264: 4, 106319993: 4, 200083349: 4, 107003581: 4, 110752881: 4, 111623634: 4, 108255529: 4, 109104070: 4, 107303640: 4, 107852119: 4, 107616614: 4, 112004465: 4, 110248120: 4, 110854609: 4, 200184625: 4, 112263554: 4, 108495957: 4, 108271128: 4, 200093609: 4, 200569620: 4, 200580270: 4, 109491726: 4, 111903811: 4, 108353227: 4, 107226876: 4, 200259209: 4, 200279942: 4, 107074216: 4, 107734618: 4, 107335882: 4, 11524: 4, 108168637: 4, 106859002: 4, 108288200: 4, 107616008: 4, 105887231: 4, 107611308: 4, 106041637: 4, 107793366: 4, 105886042: 4, 106890504: 4, 108594123: 4, 106091772: 4, 108730433: 4, 106383866: 4, 11509: 4, 105805707: 4, 105840154: 4, 105805797: 4, 109117485: 3, 106186551: 3, 107117061: 3, 106558409: 3, 10994: 3, 111256339: 3, 107240862: 3, 106347294: 3, 106088454: 3, 110818266: 3, 15043: 3, 105898385: 3, 106418002: 3, 107537378: 3, 106389004: 3, 106239028: 3, 106200072: 3, 112475989: 3, 108583043: 3, 107995117: 3, 108282289: 3, 106838734: 3, 106967939: 3, 105798365: 3, 109899776: 3, 111003201: 3, 108302178: 3, 110931603: 3, 106738886: 3, 106210225: 3, 112105443: 3, 106666369: 3, 107290679: 3, 200192115: 3, 106104499: 3, 109041711: 2, 105896397: 2, 111415956: 2}"

Like everything else on the Lower Wall, the rock is impeccable and the moves technical. However, this pitch really stands out because of its incredible variety. First 30 feet is cruiser 5.10ish, then you can literally sit down and gather your wits for the boulder crux; and of course, ogle the panorama of Merchant and Mt. Index. The BP will be vastly different depending on height. I'm barely 5' and used a mono under-cling to access to start holds. Taller climbers 6'+ might utilize an enormous reach. Either way, it is challenging. --- more 5.10 follows to a slabby rest position. Once at the roof, rev up the biceps & dance on across to an exposed perch. Once rested, pop the clutch and switch into crack mode. Punch it high before placing a piece, then hang on till the anchor. ***  Originally thought this was 5.12.

Ten Percent Direct (En Passant),116994868,Trad,105790707,5.14-,50,1,3.5,2.0,"Blake Herrington originally pointed me to the undone direct start of Ten Percent Meteorological Vinculation. “Ten Percent” is a 5 pitch climb in the center of Index’s Lower Town Wall, first aided in 1972 by aid climbing legends, Bruce Carson and Dave Anderson (Carson and Yvon Chouinard were the first to climb the Nose clean, without a hammer). The first 50 feet of true start still had not been freed and was one of the most obvious remaining challenges at Index.  When I got on it for the first time, I couldn’t do all the moves but I could see that it would go, and was surprised that no one had done it yet. The holds and the sequences are quite beautiful...pure Index, but on another level from what I had been on before.  It took about a year of getting on it here and there till I saw how it went and could link large sections. After an easy intro, the main part of the climb is only 25 moves, but 25 moves of tricky and hard vertical granite bouldering, with some classic Index funk and consistent bad feet. I linked the crux 3-move boulder for the first time this winter and knew then that it could go at any point.  I decided to add 2 bolts to be consistent with how the rest of Ten Percent is bolted, and started to make attempts on lead. After 15 or so attempts over a few months, including a couple falls above the crux, I sent on a cool and dry spring evening, likely one of the last good days before the summer heat.  This route could go gear only, but it seemed way more fun to not have to wiggle in stoppers, take massive, awkward, and possibly dangerous falls on them, and then wiggle them out to make another “clean” attempt. Somebody could surely do it...they will be way more badass than me. But now people can go free ground up safely and focus on enjoying the moves on one of Index’s best routes.  After a few difficult boulders, the route breaks hard right on a line of crimps with bad feet to the ledge below the low anchors on Japanese Gardens. You could probably go straight up and avoid the ledge, but this seemed contrived. And instead of continuing up the 5.11+ climbing on Ten Percent I decided to end it short. It didn’t seem to fit the nature of the free variation to lengthen the pitch.  I’m suggesting another name for the direct free variation, “En Passant,” French for “In Passing,” because it resonates with “Ten Percent,” and because I think the reintegration of the direct start deserves a more interesting name than “10% Direct.” The crux clocks in around V10/11, and you can fall in other places as well. I think it’s a solid step up from Amandla (5.13+) in difficulty and is likely Index’s first 5.14.","{107681287: 4, 108168637: 3}"

TPMV (10% Meteorological Vinculation),106328521,Trad,105790707,5.13a,300,4,3.9,19.0,"10% Meteorological Vinculation (or TPMV for shot) is a classic 4 pitch excursion up the entirety of the Lower Wall.  Most often only the spectacular short version of p1 (via Japanese Gardens, .11+) is climbed. The original aid version of this route had 5 pitches (5.8 A4). The free version really only has 4, as the original second pitch is best combined with p1. P1 (Original): Formerly the last remaining bit of aid on the original TPMV, this section was free climbed recently at 5.14-. See neighboring entry ""10% Direct (En Passant)"". This is also an excellent C1/2 climb and in years past was often used as a place to practice hanging belays and setting up hammocks/portaledges.  For many years there was a two bolt anchor about 40’ up to facilitate aid practice.P1 (Japanese Gardens to TPMV):  This pitch is most often done as a standalone climb by beginning on P1 of Japanese Gardens and then stepping left at the first (short) anchor. The rest of the pitch follows shallow corners and cracks past 3 bolts and gear to another anchor (.11+).  P1 (Extended): Climb the Japanese Gardens P1/TPMV linkup as described above but keep continue past the anchor. The section above consists of a difficult height dependent bouldery section protected by good but small gear (.12c-.13a). The gear must be placed well, otherwise the fall onto the P1 anchor is fairly substantial. As such, it is a mandatory strategy if free climbing to climb this as one pitch from the ground. This extension is basically the old ""Chopper Flake"" pitch 2 of TPMV; see ""History"" for more information about the flake.P2: This was actually P3 of the original aid climb. Climb cracks up a RFC to a comfortable ledge.  From there face climbing angles left to an anchor below the obvious corner start of the slab pitch (fun 5.10-, slightly runout).P3: Fantastic, challenging pitch of slab and corner. Traverse left and up from the anchor and do a committing and slightly scary move back right to clip the first bolt. Continue up the difficult corner via bolts and gear, then follow the left-trending dike until you can step right to a ledge with an anchor via runout 5.9 climbing. Alternately, continue up the dike and over the roof to join Newest Industry. This pitch can also be approached via P1-2 of Japanese Gardens and is well worth the trip either way (.11b/c).P4: This pitch climbs a slab past a bolt and some gear to a tough little mantle past a bolt. (5.10d) Cracks then lead near the anchor on top of Newest Industry, but 10% continues on via three slab options: a) climb out right and then up over some overlaps to the anchor (5.8). At one point there was a bolt and a pin on this variation. b) continue straight up past 2 bolts to the anchor. This variation has the best protection (5.9). c) an easier variation with less protection climbs to the left before arching back to the right to the anchor. It should be noted that a fun alternate finish that joins Japanese Gardens can be climbed by following a ramp up and right to join JG on its last pitch (5.11).","{106558409: 4, 107074216: 4, 111624139: 4, 110752881: 4, 200092901: 4, 107303640: 4, 107335882: 4, 108736685: 4, 105896397: 4, 107003581: 4, 108288200: 4, 107919778: 4, 15043: 4, 107616008: 4, 106890504: 4, 105887231: 4, 106091772: 4, 106104499: 4, 108302178: 3}"

Free at Last,114144505,Trad,108143218,5.10d,440,4,3.4,22.0,"This version of Free at Last from the new guidebook is a bit of a rework that combines pitches from the original full Tatoosh, Free at Last, and Voyage of the Majestic Glass Eyed Tuna.  This route is packed from top to bottom with varied, thought provoking crack climbing that will force you to pull on your thinking cap.   Pitch 1 (5.10b, 35m): Start up the modern version of Tatoosh (well documented here: mountainproject.com/route/1…).  Instead of belaying at the normal anchor for Tatoosh under a large perched block, continue up 10 feet of dirty terrain and belay off a tree.  Alternatively, split off about half way up, climb up the original pitch two of Tatoosh and belay at the anchors of WATWB/Just Say NO2.     Pitch 2 (5.9, 35 meters): This pitch is the lowest quality on the route due to some mandatory dirt scrambling, but it still has a good bit of fun crack climbing.  Head up a clean, low angle V-slot, with a thin crack in the back.  Hike up some dirt and climb some creative sequences up cracks in the corner to the next belay.   Pitch 3 (5.10b, 35m): This pitch has quite a few cruxes and felt more sustained than pitch 4, but it's all there.  Begin by heading up the corner to the first crux at the obvious roof.  This is definitely harder than 10b if you opt to burl through it, but there are some sneaky tricks to it.  A good stance above the roof separates the next crux, which will require even more creative thinking.  Once at the base of the overhanging ice cream cone feature, head up and left to the third smeary slab crux, protected by a bolt, and finally up and right along an easy ramp to the belay.   Pitch 4 (5.10d, 30m): Just when you are getting used to the funky crack movement, this pitch slaps you in the face with some hard face climbing past two bolts.  We were a little confused by the bolt placements here.  Start by mantling into a little boxy ledge and clip the first bolt, then climb straight left to a blocky crack.  I placed a red metolius here to protect against a pendulum as I moved up to the next bolt, then reached down and pulled it out after clipping.  Continue up to a right leaning crack and then to the base of the imposing V-slot.  This slot is the real money climbing of the route, but I would HIGHLY recommend taping up to get the most enjoyment out of it.  At the top of the slot, clip a bolt and make a few last moves up and right to the chains.  Give your thanks to Saint Francis before heading down!   Descent: Rappel the route with a 70 meter rope.  It works best to use the anchor of WATWB/Just Say NO2 for the last rappel, which is climber's right of the couple trees at the top of the first pitch.

Begin via ledgy climbing (some loose blocks exist) and an easy chimney with a pin to the base of a thin groove reminiscent of initial Slow Children corner (but with a much thinner crack). Climb the groove using some small nuts and a pin and transfer into the upper corner (.11). Physical flared crack climbing with surprisingly good gear leads past a bolt (.11). Clip a flimsy looking pin and pull the roof with some trickery (.10+). Stop at the anchor here or continue past 3 or 4 bolts on the arete (.10) to another anchor at the very top of the Narrow Arrow.,"{106104499: 4, 108138071: 4, 108168637: 4}"

First clip a bolt and climb up into the corner system right of Shirley.  When that corner ends place a thin piece or two and step left to rejoin Shirley.  This start is approximately 10+.      Next climb Shirley into the hand-jam pod below the crux stemming on that route.  Reach left and clip a bolt out on the arete, then down-climb until both hands are on the jug flake on the left side of the Shirley pillar.  From here, climb up and left into the oblique dihedral past two more bolts, encountering two distinct boulder problems on the way to the NAD ledge.      I found this route to be a bit harder than its neighbor, Narrow Arrow Direct, but not as hard as the Narrow Arrow Overhang.  While the crux section is short the climbing is powerful and sustained with good movement and the rig makes a nice addition to the hard climbing at the wall.","{105896397: 4, 15043: 3}"

Warning, a 70 meter rope is needed to reach the ground on this one.","{106418002: 4, 106890504: 4, 105805707: 4, 105805797: 4, 105789175: 4, 107118298: 4, 105849121: 4, 107497633: 4, 12522: 4, 106983134: 4, 105919013: 4, 106744745: 4, 14568: 4, 106951875: 4, 106941307: 4, 106394111: 4, 105896358: 4, 105789684: 4, 105887231: 4, 106136895: 4, 106054402: 4, 107616008: 4, 105805486: 4, 105898385: 4, 106158624: 4, 106484179: 4, 106228825: 4, 106134676: 4, 106251374: 4, 106257649: 4, 106104499: 4, 105886042: 4, 106423680: 4, 105889684: 4, 105849353: 4, 105790555: 4, 10994: 4, 106558409: 4, 106210225: 4, 106666369: 4, 106801532: 4, 106868458: 4, 106871882: 4, 106531787: 4, 106920443: 4, 106389004: 4, 107138006: 4, 105935712: 4, 107313996: 4, 107303640: 4, 106486749: 4, 106455351: 4, 107120404: 4, 15023: 4, 106838734: 4, 106214063: 4, 108025083: 4, 106892642: 4, 107919778: 4, 106670517: 4, 15043: 4, 106776142: 4, 107083315: 4, 108308935: 4, 107027962: 4, 105788014: 4, 107684440: 4, 107184171: 4, 108514216: 4, 108205740: 4, 107793366: 4, 107653186: 4, 108288200: 4, 107224861: 4, 108425059: 4, 106601971: 4, 105978184: 4, 108457784: 4, 106555971: 4, 108277243: 4, 109607807: 4, 108255529: 4, 108552057: 4, 108282289: 4, 109749748: 4, 107240862: 4, 108779908: 4, 110247151: 4, 106558554: 4, 106738886: 4, 108272772: 4, 107257522: 4, 110261526: 4, 11509: 4, 108066294: 4, 106940732: 4, 108029322: 4, 106383866: 4, 106239028: 4, 108984178: 4, 107910140: 4, 110711486: 4, 106224334: 4, 109104070: 4, 106859002: 4, 110248120: 4, 105890911: 4, 106319993: 4, 108583043: 4, 109899776: 4, 108967941: 4, 111737052: 4, 110752881: 4, 107003581: 4, 112367260: 4, 105958777: 4, 108329246: 4, 110103936: 4, 108730433: 4, 108864561: 4, 108267789: 4, 107394785: 4, 111938003: 4, 112089199: 4, 200063789: 4, 108308457: 4, 112277189: 4, 112475989: 4, 108302178: 4, 11409: 4, 111841723: 4, 112856061: 4, 110931603: 4, 200137922: 4, 108745996: 4, 112528878: 4, 107715396: 4, 108092606: 4, 109199215: 4, 109514934: 4, 107640602: 4, 200103621: 4, 200048717: 4, 109163787: 4, 108442055: 4, 106949749: 4, 106077459: 4, 200192115: 4, 111149410: 4, 110816178: 4, 110335247: 4, 111206285: 4, 200357245: 4, 111764983: 4, 200022936: 4, 108279275: 4, 109431904: 4, 110669338: 4, 200170248: 4, 200271831: 4, 112096766: 4, 108155086: 4, 107734618: 4, 107260705: 4, 113374239: 4, 111878041: 4, 107928598: 4, 111256339: 4, 200259209: 4, 200043948: 4, 108839199: 4, 108226968: 4, 106945872: 4, 112524781: 4, 107537378: 4, 200177081: 4, 200185755: 4, 107735421: 4, 200405696: 4, 200161465: 4, 112261771: 4, 200063657: 4, 200267777: 4, 200580270: 4, 109609886: 4, 110220193: 4, 200118368: 4, 200184625: 4, 200392723: 4, 112008242: 4, 200093609: 4, 200372264: 4, 109018466: 4, 111859201: 4, 110700542: 4, 111250005: 4, 110818266: 4, 109359725: 4, 112263554: 4, 110331339: 4, 200075170: 4, 106156272: 3, 106024037: 3, 106006265: 3, 106347294: 3, 106714648: 3, 107847660: 3, 106088454: 3, 106186551: 3, 106735280: 3, 107290679: 3, 108121368: 3, 105904878: 3, 108282601: 3, 106098789: 3, 107603653: 3, 110114491: 3, 108236993: 3, 109749744: 3, 108200278: 3, 108168637: 3, 109140657: 3, 10168: 3, 111076967: 3, 107995117: 3, 108243264: 3, 111624139: 3, 10544: 3, 107559987: 3, 200048015: 3, 106590161: 3, 200226837: 3, 112315730: 3, 200446052: 3, 200480046: 3, 200447621: 3, 111415956: 2, 106910356: 2, 14537: 2, 200202844: 2, 106353545: 1}"

The crux is climbing the thin crack/weird arch at the start (kind of off balance laybacking) and making a reach to a jug at the top where the crack ends.  The section above the first bolt has several  RP placements.   When dirty the moss here is like ball bearings but when clean the rock is quite grippy.  Once good holds are reached the next protection is the second bolt. This section is relatively easy but you wouldn't want to fall here. Above the second pin a LFC is followed to the anchor.  Not sure what to make of the 5.12 r/x rating in the current guide. I put R here just because a fall above the crux would be bad and the guidebook claims a r/x rating.

Adrift,117094261,Trad,105790976,5.13c,500,7,4.0,2.0,"It's a bit complicated, but not that complicated. This climb is partially finished but some excellent pitches can be climbed by skipping the undone first pitch and rappelling before the unfinished sixth pitch. The nature of the ledge system above the first pitch tier allows for a combining of pitches to make several variations possible. We plan to finish the climb in its entirety this season but I would love for people to get on the completed pitches as soon as possible. Life is short after all.  P1, 30m- This one is not yet finished but is very, very nice and would make a great and challenging single pitch outing in it's own right. It starts just to the left of the huge ledge to the left of the waterfall and climbs a seam/corner through a small roof that eventually diminishes (crux) and passes through Non Local Bark House.  P2, 15m- Climb through a small overlap on nice edges to a challenging slab crux deadpoint with tough overhung slopers to Adrift Ledge. Beautiful rock and stunning movement on this tough little pitch. 5.12  P3, 20m- THE pitch. This is the most inspiring thing I've ever climbed. On one of my first trips to the Upper Wall, during which I struggled to get up P2 of DHLA, I looked up at this section of wall and wondered if anything could be climbed through it. As it turns out, there are just enough features to make it possible. The first few meters are overhanging and bouldery, with the most physical moves of the route on flat edges. Probably V6/7 to a decent shake out before an artful sequence on small crimps and big edges to a most Index of mantles and a bit of a reprieve. Traverse rightwards on perfect rock to a highly magical crux deadpoint to one perfectly placed knob (thank you, Sky Lord!) and a tenuous hand/foot match, ~V8. A few easier moves lead to a good rest on a bread loaf hold where you can calm down and commit to the tenuous and obscure slab sequence that guards the anchor. I could see this being a real heart-breaker. Such a delicious pitch and a true Index test-piece. Feels about on par with Amandla in difficulty. 5.13c  P4, 20m- Another outstanding pitch on stunning features through the blankest section of the central wall area. A crux right off the belay on yet another magical hold and tiny but good feet leads to a no hands rest. Two more blocs separated by no-hands rests lead to a small corner and roof on jugs through the neat dike that cuts across the UTW. Ends on a nice ledge. Could definitely be linked with the crux pitch for just the most mega thing ever. 5.12  P5, 15m- Pleasant climbing on the dike leads to a small ledge. 5.10  P6, 40m- This monster pitch is mixed bolts and gear, with a crux right at the end of the overhung headwall on small crimps. Super nice, a bit spicy and not yet suitable to lead to it's finish. ~11d  P7, 10m- Top out on the final pitch of Swim.","{108168637: 4, 106558409: 4}"

Undercling out 10ft left on good holds and feet. Stem up a corner with a crack in it. Even though this section looks like it could take good finger sized pieces we added a few bolts, due to the fact that the feature that takes the gear has a fracture on the face that we did not feel comfortable sending people up on placing gear ( we rather play it safe). The feature passed the 5ft hedge bar test and is bomber to climb on. Boulder up on slopey sidepulls to a sweet dinosaurish undercling. Pull some Index funk on a wonderful shallow arete feature and link into the last three bolts of Swim p1 to the belay ledge. 12a  P2- Start up a pleasant left facing layback flake. From the top of the flake trend up a obtuse left facing corner with good edges, gastons and sidepulls. Eventually you'll reach the permadraws. Climb up slightly left to the arete. Huge holds lead to the flare. At this point it gets overhung. Get up in the flare and kneebar and layback till the kneebars get a little too wide.

You can now access some excellent 5.10 climbing on Rise and Fall and Green Drag-on without having to climb 5.12. The pitches listed below can be combined in a variety of ways depending on what you are looking for.     Pitches five and six are bouldery and have really fun movement. Big thanks to Alex and Cody for playing around on this route with me!   Pitch 1 - 5.9 - 90 ft   Climb the 5.9 start of Davis-Holland with fun jams and fingerlocks. This pitch is sometimes wet. Belay at two bolts on a nice ledge.   Pitch 2 - 5.10a - 100 ft    Continue up Davis-Holland, stellar fingers and thin hands in a corner. To a two bolt anchor on a sloping ledge.    With a few back cleaning shenanigans the 2nd pitch of Davis-Holland can be combined with the next pitch which yields an amazing 55m pitch of 5.10 climbing.   Pitch 3 - 5.10c - 100 feet - 8 Bolts   From the belay look up and right for a lone bolt with a black painted hanger. Undercling across the roof, per the right variation of the Davis-Holland, and then step right to a perfect jug under the bolt. Execute a short trickey section which yields a horizontal (#2 camalot) and some moderate face climbing to get onto the second pitch of Rise and Fall. Skip the belay out right and clip another black painted bolt up and to the left.     Follow amazing crystal edges up a dike passed 6 spaced bolts. This is the second pitch of Rise and Fall. The crux comes at the end getting past two different roofs. Belay at a good stance with three bolts.   Pitch 4 - 5.10d - 75 feet - 2 bolts    Start up Rise and Fall passing one bolt until you reach a finger crack. Get some gear and step right below a bolt that is on Green Drag-on. Clip this and continue up to a two bolt anchor under a roof. (This is the end of pitch 3 of Green Drag-on).    Clip the anchor for pro and make a hard move to get established in the steep crack that exits the right side of the roof. Sustained 5.10 crack climbing leads to a stance on the left with two bolts. This anchor is not setup for rappel, so if you want to bail you need to aid up and left on Green Drag-on or climb the next pitch and rappel Town Crier. It is possible to split this into two 40 foot pitches but there is no reason to do so and the P3 anchor on Green Drag-on is fully hanging and an awful place to belay.   Pitch 5 - 5.11c/d - 40 feet - 4 bolts    Climb up the corner with some thin gear to a good jug. Clip a shiny bolt out right. (The bolts above and to the left are for Green Drag-on) A balancy section leads to a tenuous second clip. There are holds, if you look in the right places! Keep working right with a powerful section past the third bolt. Clip the final bolt and step right to the three bolt anchor on Town Crier.    Pitch 6 - 5.11d - 105 feet - 2 bolts.    Start up the flare on Town Crier and clip a few pins that can be backed up with thin gear. Execute a sweet layback sequence (crux) to get established on a flexy flake. Crank past the flake, 2 bolts protect, and then immediately start traversing left on an obvious horizontal crack. (Going up further is the 5.12+ crux pitch of Town Crier)    Twenty feet of sweet jugs bring you back to the Green Drag-on. Follow the final 50 feet of 5.10 crack climbing to an anchor on a busy ledge.

Davis-Holland Route,105836583,Trad,105790976,5.10c,400,3,3.9,228.0," The Davis-Holland Route is a super-classic at Index. Although it technically has 6 pitches, most only do the first 3 and either rap from there or continue up Lovin' Arms to the top of the Upper Wall (this combination is also very classic).  P1: Jam up a handcrack (sometimes a little wet when the rest of the route is dry). Upon reaching a ledge, wander over right and then back to your left on small terraces to reach a bolted belay in a right-facing corner. 5.8+  P2: Jam and/or lieback the crack up the right-facing corner to another bolted belay. 5.10a  P3: Climb up and right from the anchor, around the roof, then back left into a right-facing corner (another variation goes directly out left around the corner past a bolt, but the moves are very balancy and potentially harder than the route's original crux). Climb up the corner past a crux with delicate footwork and small holds to a bolted belay on a ledge. Rap from this belay (or continue on Lovin Arms). 5.10c  Instead of rapping the route, it is wiser to rappel 25m to a 3-bolt anchor directly below the P3 anchor.  Then either a double-rope (55m) rap to the ground or a couple more 20-30m rappels trending climber's left via anchors on the sport wall.","{15023: 4, 105863172: 4, 106890504: 4, 105789684: 4, 105801073: 4, 105805797: 4, 105805486: 4, 105849121: 4, 105789175: 4, 105798761: 4, 14568: 4, 106001455: 4, 105896358: 4, 106776142: 4, 106714648: 4, 107123122: 4, 106006265: 4, 106158624: 4, 105898385: 4, 107616008: 4, 106319993: 4, 106054402: 4, 105849353: 4, 105886042: 4, 105939248: 4, 106404256: 4, 106348322: 4, 106257649: 4, 105805707: 4, 106801532: 4, 106531787: 4, 106455351: 4, 106186551: 4, 107002071: 4, 106389004: 4, 107138006: 4, 107254855: 4, 106210225: 4, 107303640: 4, 107313996: 4, 106871882: 4, 105812861: 4, 106214063: 4, 106670517: 4, 107684440: 4, 108197152: 4, 106489329: 4, 108282289: 4, 107618213: 4, 107118298: 4, 107653186: 4, 108288200: 4, 107224861: 4, 107919778: 4, 106601971: 4, 107053533: 4, 108302178: 4, 108255529: 4, 108066294: 4, 108457784: 4, 107616773: 4, 15043: 4, 107280303: 4, 108277243: 4, 107724277: 4, 107335882: 4, 109402992: 4, 106032918: 4, 106043032: 4, 109607807: 4, 108173400: 4, 108583043: 4, 107656938: 4, 109554096: 4, 108302681: 4, 107067454: 4, 107302730: 4, 106987860: 4, 109474977: 4, 105797501: 4, 108029322: 4, 106239028: 4, 110248120: 4, 106383866: 4, 107497633: 4, 111151945: 4, 109449620: 4, 109969730: 4, 108967941: 4, 108153590: 4, 109313896: 4, 109749744: 4, 106347294: 4, 110904912: 4, 111957607: 4, 110711486: 4, 107635859: 4, 112047216: 4, 10168: 4, 107998332: 4, 106569451: 4, 110863924: 4, 108268794: 4, 107910140: 4, 106859002: 4, 107563613: 4, 111737052: 4, 107616614: 4, 110966072: 4, 111722100: 4, 108968554: 4, 111003201: 4, 111624139: 4, 106249678: 4, 112477208: 4, 112315730: 4, 105958777: 4, 110752881: 4, 110547057: 4, 108730433: 4, 106887732: 4, 106679556: 4, 108538771: 4, 112475989: 4, 108234065: 4, 108308457: 4, 106519623: 4, 111415956: 4, 109638995: 4, 106940732: 4, 107603653: 4, 110103936: 4, 111841723: 4, 108243264: 4, 107297910: 4, 107715396: 4, 110854609: 4, 200070835: 4, 113374239: 4, 107184171: 4, 14537: 4, 109518612: 4, 107290679: 4, 107003581: 4, 110335247: 4, 112096766: 4, 111938175: 4, 109899776: 4, 200048015: 4, 109431904: 4, 112304988: 4, 111938003: 4, 107394785: 4, 110669338: 4, 200170248: 4, 107971515: 4, 107312116: 4, 200357245: 4, 200351166: 4, 109199215: 4, 111282664: 4, 108155086: 4, 110931603: 4, 112540068: 4, 109514934: 4, 111971885: 4, 200455675: 4, 106885514: 4, 111190382: 4, 110838115: 4, 111660259: 4, 107226876: 4, 107866982: 4, 7067922: 4, 200497600: 4, 111859201: 4, 105835981: 4, 111214144: 4, 200184723: 4, 200043948: 4, 107537378: 4, 112528878: 4, 110331339: 4, 112990119: 4, 106212464: 4, 10405: 4, 200259209: 4, 200161465: 4, 200446052: 4, 200226837: 4, 200333628: 4, 200177081: 4, 200022936: 4, 112008242: 4, 112112035: 4, 200493116: 4, 200093609: 4, 110700542: 4, 200202760: 4, 111250005: 4, 109580559: 4, 107561580: 4, 200158199: 4, 200899747: 4, 200373406: 4, 105797778: 4, 200569620: 4, 200482803: 4, 106666369: 4, 107240862: 3, 106353545: 3, 106558409: 3, 107083315: 3, 106910356: 3, 106423680: 3, 108168637: 3, 107078873: 3, 111091265: 3, 107995117: 3, 111943881: 3, 112204075: 3, 106838734: 3, 200192115: 3, 111882825: 3, 106738886: 3, 106920443: 3, 106418002: 3, 110148614: 3}"

This route lies under the rap route that has been used in recent years to descend from Madsen's Ledge.  I remember a conversation with Randy Ladowski a year or two back about trying to free this piece of stone. There was a great deal of excitement despite the need for a large amount of scrubbing and excavation of moss.  This pitch starts on the Aid route abraxas but then branches into new free climbable terrain above a second roof at a smattering of knobs.  Randy's original free variation follows a pair of dikes on the right past three bolts which I found to be unreasonably difficult. To find the Gnostic Diversion instead clip the first bolt and balance up the slab on the left.  Once a second bolt is reached execute a difficult rightward boulder problem to rejoin the dikes. A few more tricky moves gain a vegetated ledge with a lower off anchor.  I expect a second pitch will be cleaned in the coming months but it's still a project.,{105790555: 3}

Rise and Fall,106875478,Trad,105790976,5.12,600,5,4.0,7.0,"Shrouded in mystery until recently, an ominous description in an older guidebook makes this route sound impossible and terrifying. In reality, the route merely suffers from a well-known Index paradox: like most long Upper Town Wall free routes, despite the fact that Rise and Fall is amazing and was established in the 90's at a relatively modest grade, it saw few (if any?) subsequent ascents until the summer of 2010. With more traffic, the climb has been rediscovered as a classic. The alleged runout section on the 5.10- second pitch isn't runout at all; it seems bolts may have been added at some point in the past, or perhaps the information was suspect to begin with. Appropriately, the climb was named after an incident involving one of the first ascentionists and an unfortunate rappel off the ends of his ropes while descending the route. Miraculously, he limped away from the fifty foot ground fall and subsequent tumble with a mere broken ankle (and maybe a few ribs; story can be found in old Climbing or Rock and Ice magazine)! Anyway, here are the pitch descriptions:    (Approach via Green Dragon or Davis Holland)    P1: Climb the corner that comprises the second pitch of Green Dragon past four bolts before moving left onto a face. Traverse left with difficulty, then up a quartzite dike that leads to crux passing a roof. Liebacking and face climbing on the continuing dike leads to an anchor (.12a/b)    P2: Airy climbing up a dike leads past a roof and some really cool rock to another belay atop a small ledge (.10a). A short pitch, but fun and interesting.    P3: A fairly short pitch that packs a wicked punch; consensus is that this may actually be the crux of the climb. From the belay, climb right and up more quartz holds and some knobs in a corner to a crack lieback. Climb the roof above the lieback via edges and pull over onto a slab with a really tough and tenuous mantle. Get your magic toes ready and pull off another improbable mantle-like move and a few really thin slab moves before the difficulty relents and a belay is reached (.11d++).    P4: Climb a long and varied slab with some wild pockets (even a monodoigt or two!), roofs, bulges and a couple of thin crux sections (.11c).    P5: Climb overhanging, blocky rock to an anchor below the top of the Upper Town Wall (.10b). Loose in places; one of the bolts is in a hanging three or four ton block stack that vibrated when I sounded it out, so use caution. There is natural gear near the bolt if attaching yourself to it makes you nervous. Short pitch.

This idea is core to Finnish culture and is said to be the national motto.  The story goes that Karl Kaiyala and friends spent 27 days scrubbing and prepping this route.

The route has afternoon shade.  P1 - 40 m - 5.11+, 16 bolt.   If you just climb this pitch of Sisu you will not be let down. Pitch 1 is a tour de force of index trickery. Awesome knobs, tricky mantles and a bit of slab to keep you on your toes. Finish on Madsen's ledge at a chain anchor.  P2 - 18 m - 5.10+, 6 bolts   From the anchor, walk right 20 feet and climb up a few boulders to reach the wall. The first bolt is way to the right of the line and should be back cleaned if possible. Traverse the horizontal cracks and then start crimping up and left to a belay.  P3 - 15 m - 5.10+, 6 bolts.   Climb horizontally to the right under-clinging the roof/flake system. Eventually crimps appear above the lip of the roof and you can make your way to the belay.  P4 - 25 m - 5.11-, 11 bolts   Start traversing to the left and then head straight up into the first crux. Catch a rest and follow the left leaning crack system past a few more challenging sections to a hanging belay.  P5 - 10 m - 5.11+, 6 bolts A few tricky moves off the belay lead to a large flake. From here follow amazing edges up and right before hitting the final crux, getting to another hanging belay  P6 - 30 m - 5.11, 12 bolts   Tenuous knobs and slopers give way to a fun flake system. Follow this, until faced with a knobby crux moving to the right. Follow crimps and features for a ways until you hit a big ledge. Belay at a double ring anchor.  P7 - 35 m - 5.10-, ~8 bolts.    There are two ways to belay at the end of this pitch. If you have a 60m rope it's best to belay on the far left, at an anchor with huge chain links.

Protection is generally good to excellent throughout, and was well tested on many occasions before the final successful ascent. There is some brittle rock; helmets and common sense advised.    The first two pitches make for one of Zekes' mellower outings, and are easily linkable as a nice long warmup pitch by anyone thinking of going further.    After that, it gets hard. Although I've managed a handful of 5.12- sport routes, I had to dig deep to free this one, and lean hard on some amazing and patient partners.  The most useful bit of beta I can offer based on my experience is to take advantage of the comfortable ledges and the winding geometry, which makes it very easy to lower a bight of rope down to the second and haul a pack up pitches 3 and 4.  There's basically no reason not to start pitch 5 fully hydrated and arguably fresh.    Pick a cool day and go for it.    Pitch overview:    p1 5.10c Bolted slabby face with gear needed in easier upper section.   p2 5.10a/b Straight up short crack, clip bolt and step R to ledge. Easily linked with p1.   p3 5.11d Follow bolts up and L (5.11+), to reach huge roof then undercling/jam (5.11-) back R to ledge below huger roof. Short pitch, easy to haul pack.   p4 5.12a LFC to crux undercling (gear) out roof. Then bolts to the anchor. Short pitch, easy to haul pack.   p5 5.11c/d Bolts up and L with increasing exposure. (See descent notes; you won't be able to rap the route if you do this pitch.)   p6 5.11a/b Bolts up short clean dihedral to top.    Descent: a single 60m rope will easily get you down from any point up to top of p4, but a 70m rope is nicer if you do the whole route.    From top of p4, rap the route.    From top of p6, either bushwhack off R, or:   (1) Rap straight down to top of p5, 20m. (DON'T GO LOWER, even with 2 ropes, unless you at least clip the p5 anchor as a directional. It's a steep wall.)   (2) Rap straight down into the void (autoblock recommended, have your daisy ready). Bounce to reach Fixe rings in a giant triangular cutout halfway down the spectacular white headwall, 20m.   (3) Rap to wide open slab, then angle gently R (toward the base of the route) to reach final set of rings on a small slab between brushy ledges on far R edge of the big slab, 30m. (Variation: with 70m rope or a bit of scrambling, it's also possible to reach the top of p1 from here. This may be a safer choice if you're not sure your single 60m will reach the final rings.)   (4) Rap bushy, somewhat loose, terrain to ground, angling R toward start of climb, 30m. ",{106489329: 4}

Rock quality is poor in a lot of areas, be ready for run out ridge climbing. My lengths are rough estimates. We climbed with a 70m rope.  P1: Start up the gully to the left of the saddle with trees. I made it to the ridge and went over it to belay off trees on the south side of the ridge. (200ft)  P2: From the trees scramble down and skiers left until below a chimney-ish feature with a chockstone at its top. You won't see the chockstone from the trees, but it will be very obvious to spot from below once you scramble over. Climb up to below the chockstone. Supposedly there is another variation that acends the ridge itself here and ends above the chockstone. (90ft)  P3: Go around and then over the chockstone to start climbing the ridge itself. There is a hard to protect move along the way up a small vertical face, with poor quality rock. Keep going until you reach a flat spot with trees on the right. I went left here to belay and be ready for the next pitch (200ft)  P4 Continue left and regain the ridge. We started simuling here. I crossed back over the ridge to the south side and spotted what looked like a nice steep section of better quality rock so I went for it, but it turned out to just be steep with poor quality rock. If this part got cleaned up it would be fun. Until then, I don't recommend it. It prob went at 5.9-ish. I think you are supposed to stay on the ridge instead of what I did.

East Ridge,119773850,Trad,111532050,Easy,400,3,0.0,1.0,"Climbing Red Mountain via its long East Ridge. Fred Beckey describes this route in his CAG as 'some minor scrambling east from the Kendall Katwalk,' this is not correct in the slightest. On the Internet, only a few instances of people attempting this route have been recorded, and all of them as a descent route. Trying to ascend this way would be disastrous. (Beckey's error is possibly because, in a previous edition before the new PCT was built, he wrote 'it might be possible once the PCT is built to scramble the East Ridge,' and apparently never went to try it.)It is possible to descend this route; I have done it. However, it involves very dangerous and slippery downclimbing on alternating polished slabs and unpleasant loose rock. I will describe it as a descent rather than an ascent, as that's how I've done it. Begin climbing down the summit block to a few slabs; traverse along them underneath the ridge crest until the ridge drops sheerly ~20 feet. Downclimb farther down to avoid this. Continue along the ridgecrest for a short while, then downclimb through loose rock around another drop. Soon afterward, downclimb into a short gully and across to where the ridgetop is heathered and forested.Everything previous is dangerous and unprotectable, although easy: a slip would lead 200 feet down onto gentler slopes. Here, however, it becomes REALLY unpleasant. There is a sheer 200+ foot cliff in the ridge; on the opposite side is a talus field that leads to the Kendall Katwalk/PCT. Downclimbing ridges and bushy gullies on the west side of this drop is a long, tedious, frightening, dangerous affair, as there's no place for a rappel and it's very difficult to see if you're leading to a straight drop or finding a passage down. Once you're down, near the head of a Commonwealth Creek tributary, begin climbing polished slabs that lead up toward the talus field. In wet weather, stay in the bush clumps as these could become very treacherous. Follow the talus field east to a final slope that reaches the PCT; then hike 6 miles back to the trailhead.",{200903515: 0}

Most ascents are done via the west side of the south ridge, which is a much more class 2 - scrambly affair, but this involves the most solid rock found on the peak in several easy, enjoyable class 3 pitches. 3 pitches is approximate; confident climbers could do this entirely unroped as the exposure is not great, or simply rope up when necessary. Belay spots c an be found on the sides of the ridge with trees.Hike the PCT from the Snoqualmie Pass north trailhead until it reaches the Commonwealth Creek trail. Hike this for about 2 miles until the peak is visible; occasionally this will bring you too far to the west. Simply traverse on heather over the ridge and perhaps downslope until you reach the solid, low-angle, bright red rock gully (class 3, no gear required, 2 pitches). Ascend until you pop over a small ridge to the main gully below the summit. Continue ascending this until the summit section becomes steep and roofy overhead. Then move left onto the hiking finish on the west side of the south ridge. Descend via the scrambling class-2 hiking route on the west.Alternatively, continue on the steep summit block directly; class 4 or low 5. Requires rope, at least, due to exposure.",{200903515: 2}

Look left for a bolt to gain the ledge (watch out for a loose handhold) and traverse right along the top of it. Do some awkward moves up through an opening. Then move up to do some pumpy moves to get to the belay. Extend some of the draws to minimize rope drag. 9 bolts P6: Follow the bolt line for some easy climbing to the next belay. 5 bolts P7: Easy scrambling. Look right to a left facing dihedral/block for the single bolt. Follow that until the summit. There may or may not be an anchor at the top (couldn't find one). Depending on comfort could sling a block, put in some small cams (0.4 and 0.5 C4s), or some nuts to build an anchor on top. 1 bolt.

It is the easiest route up spectacular Exfoliation Dome, the west face of which has been nicknamed Blueberry Hill for the wild blueberry bushes on many ledges. The alpine character applies to the climbing (predominantly trad), which has sections of clean crack and corners interspersed with blocky scrambling and occasional bush pulling. Although not highly technical, this route is physically demanding with the Granite Sidewalk approach and deproach providing an added challenge, both physical and mental. Do your homework, pack food/water, headlamps and phone/camera, of course.The well-traveled 7-pitch version attains Blueberry Terrace, a broad ledge around 2/3 of the way to the summit. From there, you can continue to the summit via scruffier climbing, or get started on the tricky rappel descent. The route-finding is fairly straight-forward and adds to the adventure, so is not described here in detail.The Start: Above a large white snag find the obvious fist crack leading to a cedar bush (see photo). Continue up a left facing corner toward the prominent right-facing corner on the buttress crest. 2 pitches.The Right-leaning Corner: Cimb the corner (slabby to right, overhanging on left), passing semi-wedged flakes and two bolts (5.8+). Exit via an airy step leftward (5.8+) back onto the buttress. Recommend doing the entire corner in a long pitch as belay options are tight.To Terrace: 3-4 more pitches of scenic crack and block climbing on the broad crest to reach Blueberry Terrace. There are numerous ledges and trees to build an anchor.Terrace to Summit: Walk left as far as you can (class 3) and find a bolted rap anchor (~100 yds beyond steep corner recommended in Smoot's Falcon guide). Continue up and left, low fifth for about 100' then 5.8-ish to a bolt. Continue straight up to a bolt belay and another bolt. From there, trend a little left over low angle rock with sparse pro toward the rounded skyline. Reach a gentle bowl where you can unrope for the final slabs to the ridge and Exfo summit.

All of the chains are Fixe rap chains, but DO NOT rap this route as flakes will EAT your rope and make for a horible trip down.      To rap off, either climb the three bonus pitches to the summit and rap off into the gully on the west side of the summit, or rap of Blueberry terrace via Jacobs Ladder on the east side of the terrace, or connect with Westward Ho by rapping off the climber right side of the terrace.

Once on the crack proper climb straight up until you reach the chains, a couple very small offset nuts will protect the upper moves well. I think a block has broken off this section in the last year making the last couple moves a little harder and scarier. 35M    Pitch 6 5.10A Climb up and left over a series of lips until you reach a large ledge system with a belay on the left hand side. 40M    Pitch 7 5.8 Head off right on the ledge before heading up and making a bold but easy move to reach the first bolt, a hand size cam behind the first block can protect from a long painful fall.

Head climbers left on the ledge and traverser above the Jacob's ladder chains until you reach a small bush about 30 feet below your first bolt.

The first three pitches link discontinuous slabs and surmount the prominent overlap (surprisingly easily) to gain the grand Salami Ledge, where the exposure and views really open up. You may notice the giant snag-topped Doug-fir looming on the skyline. That's the 'Snagglepuss' and it's where you're headed.The central slab is 350' of wide-open granite that is ascended directly by pitches 4 and 5, which offer the most classic slab climbing on the route. Pitch 6 is a mixed bag that connects to the entertaining (if grubby) finale. Pitch ratings are 5.7, 5.8+, 5.4, 5.8, 5.8+, 5.7 and 5.7.  The two 5.8+ cruxes are short and well protected. See posted topo for details.If you want to avoid the 5.8+ climbing on pitch 5, consider the 'Catwalk Variation' (5.7 PG): from the 4th belay, head left along a horizontal dike for about 30' feet then follow the diagonal dike that angles up and left. There are 4 bolts that lead you into the second pitch of the Purdie Shuffle (see topo), making for a long entertaining pitch that ties back into the upper part of Snagglepuss.","{110400348: 4, 108934942: 4, 112521589: 4, 108254193: 4, 107715396: 3, 200259209: 3, 200456973: 3, 200407311: 3, 200166628: 3, 200298278: 3, 200435672: 3, 110751501: 3, 110942763: 2}"

Snake Charmer,114980575,Trad,113757284,5.11a,500,6,3.3,4.0,"One of the newer routes in Darrington, and also one of the steepest and cleanest free routes to breach the somewhat obscure Witch Doctor Wall. Unlike the calf-burning slabs on the other side of the formation, this route is mostly gear protected and features plenty of steep cracks and flakes, though the hardest moves are still bolt protected.   The rock is solid and high quality, but the prevalence of trees all over the wall means the cracks and ledges tend to get buried in pine needles. The route and entire wall would really benefit from a little traffic - dirt and lichen also seem to think this route is pretty cool.  All belays are bolted and can be rapped with a single 70m rope. From the top of P2, rap straight down 35m to rap hangers out on the face, then make a short 15m rap to the ground just uphill from the start.   P1 - 5.9 40m - Climb the obvious left-leaning, mostly hand sized flake to a ledge. Traverse left to bolted anchor.   P2 - 5.10- 35m - More left leaning cracks to a short flare, then traverse left past a (maybe) superfluous bolt and up through a little munge to a small roof with another bolt.  P3 - 5.10 30m - Layback, jam and undercling the steep flake with a low crux. Some gear-protected face moves and one bolt to finish.  P4 - 5.11a 35m - Traverse the bolted rail and move up into a series of left-facing corners and cool steep cracks.   P5 - 5.10 35m - Move right up easy terrain and intermittent cracks to a series of six bolts arching up and left.  P6 - 5.10 15m - Climb up and right to steep cracks up bubbly rock, leading to the arete that borders the large roof at the top of the wall. Could theoretically be linked with P5, or bypassed via easy scrambling to the left.

But as Orbit gained acclaim for its own merits, Safe Sex is equally deserving. SS takes a direct line, utilizing the huge corner in middle pitches 4 and 5. It is slightly easier than Dreamer and a bit less runout.  Keep this route on your radar when you are heading to Dreamer on a nice weekend, as it is always good to have a backup plan! Don’t go without the excellent Perkins topo (mattsea.com/Darr/pdf/dreame…) which shows both routes.  Safe Sex starts at the original Dreamer start, which maximizes elevation by scrambling around on the right to the base of the shallow central corner.  P1. Launch up open slab slightly left of the corner. 2 bolts and gear. 5.7 PG  P2. Continue straight up, merging with Dreamer and sharing its 3rd belay in the shallow corner. 5 bolts. 5.8  P3. Follow P4 of Dreamer up the shallow corner and angle left. After the third bolt, head straight up where Dreamer angles left. 5.7 PG  P4. Step left around a cedar bush and climb the nice L-facing layback (5.7, cams), then right and up a steep rib (or left above overhang via 5.9 variation). If bolt is missing hanger, sling with a wired nut. 5.8  P5. The heart of the route – the ‘dirty-but-good’ corner! The corner is hardly ‘dirty’, but has bits of vegetation which is never troublesome. As the overhang looms, venture onto the steep right wall, and crimp up to the rounded rib. A looong pitch – 6 bolts and gear. 5.8+  P6. Twenty feet of steep knobs, then easier climbing wanders left to the belay. 5.8  P7. Continue left to connect with Dreamer. You can diagonal up and left across runout mid-5th ground and a bolted 5.8 bit to belay #8 (5.8 PG). Or, go directly left (low 5th) to belay #7 of the well-bolted Dreamer Direct. Better yet, ignore these words and just consult the topo  From there, rappel or continue up Dreamer to the ridge, which is highly recommended if daylight allows. Remember to factor in all the diagonal rappels, down-climbing, creek crossing and road walking ahead!  Descent requires 60m double-rope rappels. Safe Sex is the preferred rappel route as it avoids the notorious rope-eating flakes around pitch 2 of Dreamer. All stations are bolted.","{107715396: 3, 111737693: 3}"

We say new and improved, because Darrington is known for its heady, long, run-out slab routes, and this, my friends, is quite the contrary! Long, heady… a bit, but it takes gear, and lot of it! It follows the prow of the illusion wall up discontinuous cracks, and knobby slabs all the way to the highpoint of the wall. This route is not a first ascent, but rather a cleaner line than one might find in a modern Darrington route, and one that brings many different lines together. I’d like to give a shout out to Zippy, the godfather of this valley. He has climbed all over the walls of this valley, hundreds of times and has many an epic story of his own. You may see some his old bolts as you discover your own epic tail.  This route sits about 30ft right of Schizoprenic.  Pitch 1: 35m 5.9: This pitch starts out in a dirty crack system on the first of two starting ledges on northern tier of the Illusion Wall and trends right to a thin seam protected by two bolts and up to the anchors. Belay to the left of a large tree. Gear to 2” Pitch 2: 60 m 5.8: This is the least impressive pitch on the route. Follow the discontinuous cracks up towards a bushy ledge. Move right to gain the ledge. Continue between the two trees find the bolted anchors. Gear to 4” Pitch 3: 50m 5.9+: This is where the climbing gets good!! Follow discontinuous cracks, trending right, to a short squeeze chimney, yes a squeeze chimney in Darrington! Belay from the ledge above. Gear to 4” Optional #5 Pitch 4: 45m 5.10: (The knobby pitch): Start from the ledge and climb straight up, past 2 bolts to a lie back finger crack. Continue right, through a few cracks to a ledge. Follow the knobby face left, passing 6 bolts, to a set of anchors. Gear to 1” Pitch 5: 35m 5.10-: From the anchors climb knobby terrain past 3 bolts, (one with a wire loop as a hanger) to a gorgeous crack that goes from fingers, to hands, to fists, oh my! Gear to 3.5”. Pitch 6: 40m 5.10+: (The fingers pitch): This is the first crux pitch of the route and absolutely amazing!! Move up through several crack systems, stepping left below the bush. Follow a knobby face up past 1 bolt, past an old set of anchors and into the finger crack above. Follow that up to a large bush then test your ape index as you move right, towards the anchors. Lots of small gear! Gear to 2”. Pitch 7: 20m 5.10+: Crux pitch number 2. Move up through the small seam past one bolt to a bush. When you see a large knob sticking out of the wall, move left onto the other side of the face to find a left facing corner crack. Climb up and back right again when the crack closes up. Climb left to the belay in a small alcove. Pitch 8: 30m 5.10: This pitch moves up through and thin roof, past an old bolt and some brake down, trending right to a small ledge, just below an old snag. Pitch 9: 30m 5.10-: Climb up to the snag and from there, traverse left onto the tower. Move left into a crack system in the middle of the tower and follow that up to an amazing ledge. Pitch 10: 40m 5.9: Follow a finger crack to right, then move right into a sausage finger crack above. Follow discontinuous cracks, past a snag, to the summit!

Big Tree II was added in 1970, and the routes have been steadily revised over the years with added bolts allowing more travel on clean slabs and less bush pulling. Few parties follow the original first pitch of Big Tree I that started on Cornucopia Flake and most modern parties do not actually climb to the Big Tree itself. After 3 or 4 pitches, follow Shake, Rattle and Roll for a short pitch and a long one to make it a longer outing.  The  first pitch takes an obvious wide crack with a zig zag, a finger crack and then heads right to reach a set of ledges with rappel slings on a medium sized tree. A chain belay is fifteen feet up and left but standing at the tree is more comfortable.  Big Tree I: From here, step left and pass three bolts, climb a short corner, and reach a horizontal traverse left (one pro bolt here). The last move of the second pitch is a downward step to the left. Thence climb upward on flakes and corners, passing left around a tree maybe 50 feet above the belay (short pitch; many parties climb right of that tree, on much harder and dirtier rock). Climb up the right-hand of two corners, and then move out right onto a slab. If you find yourself eying a grassy seam that may have an old piton sticking out of it, it is time to look right and get onto the bolted slab. Pass an uncomfortable slab belay to reach chains at the top of this fourth pitch, maybe fifty feet below and right of the obvious ""Big Tree."" Shake, Rattle and Roll continues for two more pitches, 5.8. A short pitch climbs up and right from the Big Tree chains and a longer, varied pitch follows.  Big Tree II: Move right from the tree at the top of the first pitch, climb flakes and watch for a chance to move out right around the corner to pass through a gap in the trees lining the next corner over. Two bolts on Shake, Rattle and Roll lead to a crack and the belay. The third pitch, with 12 bolts, will feel run-out to some; it is sustained slab climbing with a 5.8 crux.  Climb a short pitch (do not skip the belay), and then a left trending pitch with bolts where you need them, but runouts between.

He intentionally climbed both roofs, with very marginal pro at best (X rated) which the guide books have the route info wrong. He then drilled the first bolt by hand on a stance. The second bolt he drilled by hand, only after reaching the lunch box hold, and then hanging off hooks. Then Stu put him back on belay and he finished the route.  The route was completely retrofitted with new lead bolts by Brooks Middleton and Michael Abrams in 2017 and remains the main attraction of the crag.  ","{200357245: 4, 110456934: 3, 107280303: 3, 200075170: 3, 200360685: 3, 200177955: 3, 111775303: 3, 200240855: 2, 105882256: 2, 111718218: 2, 112089625: 2}"

Start on .12c for a day, then head right and all the way up the fun and technical slabby to vertical hanging ramp. At the very top, a crux bulge with a boulder problem guards the anchor. Following the bolts directly seems possible but perhaps hasn't actually been done; I think originally some of us did this by climbing a couple feet to the left of the final two bolts, which was easier but still a challenge. By a couple of feet I mean that you can easily reach holds between the two options if you're just hanging there checking out moves. I recently tried 'directly' following the bolt line and found it to be pretty dang hard, enough so that I couldn't recall doing moves that difficult the first time I climbed this, but memory is of course fallible. It's also worth noting that this time around the left version was so dirty that I also couldn't imagine ever having climbed it that way, but I'm reasonably certain that's how it was done back in the day. It's hard to say which set of holds is the more intuitive. While fun and challenging, both variations of the boulder problem will be a huge and jarring slap in the face after the easier climbing on the long ramp, especially with 35m of rope weighing you down. In the end, it's really easy to A0 through the very top so hopefully it shouldn't deter folks from enjoying the other climbing.It's also possible and, in my opinion, better to climb this via Cinnamon Groove. It's a straighter line and though it's pumpier, doesn't alter the grade at all because of the more restful, technical climbing on the lower angle ramp.

Prime Rib,107730934,Sport,107192115,5.9-,1300,11,2.8,294.0,"Prime Rib is an incredibly cool easy-moderate sport climb overlooking the Methow Valley.  Solid rock, ample protection, easy access, and a wonderful location add up to a classic and fun romp up this massive wall.    Although there are 5.9 cruxes on this climb, they are all very short and very well-protected.  Overall, the route is extremely generous in its bolting.   Pitch 1: Begin at a small fir tree.  Head up easy 5th-class ledges to a large ledge with a bolted anchor next to a large fir.  (5.4)   Pitch 2: Steep face to an anchor.  (5.8)   Shift the belay to below a left-facing dihedral.   Pitch 3: Up the dihedral. You will pass a rappel anchor.  Continue up to the anchor on the ledge with the large blocks.  (5.7)   Pitch 4: Climb the face above through three steep cruxes. Juggy pockets just where you want them keep the grade moderate. End in the Notch. (5.9-)   Pitch 5: Climb the straight-forward face above. Belay at a tree. (5.7)   Shift the belay to the large fir by the wall. The top of the gully is here. It is my understanding that you can descend the gully from here. It might be an unpleasant ""pinball"" experience down the scree. Beware loose rock from above.   Pitch 6: Climb a nicely exposed face with a slight left-to-right traverse. (5.8)   Pitch 7: This pitch begins with a bouldery crux off the ledge. There are a couple more bouldery moves on this fun pitch. (5.9-)   Shift the belay again to below the juggy slab. There is a large fir tree here showing scars from the frequent rockfall at this spot. Beware, especially if there are parties above you here.   Pitch 8: Climb the fun juggy slab to a semi-hanging anchor. (5.8)   Pitch 9: This pitch follows a short, exposed traverse to the right. (5.4)   Pitch 10: Traverse back to the left. You will reach a 2-bolt anchor. It might be preferable to continue up to the beginning of the next pitch and belay off of the first bolt. If you opt to belay off of the 2-bolt anchor, be sure to shift your belay before starting Pitch 11. (Easy 5th-, 4th-, and 3rd class)   Pitch 11: The money pitch. Begin by ascending a short leaning pillar. Stem over to the main wall, and thrutch up a somewhat awkward set of features. Beyond, the awkwardness eases, but the difficulty remains consistent.

Once clipped though the rest of the pitch eases in difficulty. From the last bolt to the tree is really runout (30'?) but on 5.6 dirty climbing (be cautious). You can place a crap #4 cam or even better, a #5 cam, in the large crack to reduce the length of the runout. Climb to the obvious Madrone tree and set up a belay.

I even heard one route developer say they thought about chipping it!      Anchors were probably installed shortly after the golden age of Tieton route development but the line was never bolted due to the difficulty and fear that the route would become a squeeze job.    In 2002 a young and talented Yakima lad named Paul Marquard was on a mission to up the ante in the Tieton.  Armed with a Bosch and the desire to bolt anything that looked hard he set out to create a Tieton classic.  I don't what to drop the hammer on the hype machine but I truly believe the movement and overall quality of this route are of a high standard.    Paul worked the climb falling at the crux numerous times until one day he won the battle of sloper warfare and cruised to the top where he fell at the last little tricky section.  After that Paul moved away and never got back on it.  The First Ascent is undocumented so we will never really know who sent it first.  There was some speculation RMI guide Casey Grom might have done the FA referring to it as The Reach Around for a move he did at the crux.    Since the FA party is unknown I feel it's fair to give the developer credit for his work and stick to what he named it.      Go big at the start, climb up on fun holds to a strenuous clip and into the crux, after that hold on to the end.     I have seen the crux done 3 different ways.  Some will stray right to the arete (which is off route according to Paul) and some will head left.  I personally feel the left path flows better but might be slightly harder.

The crack might feel 5.10 or it might feel harder; focus on your feet and don’t forget the left arete. I protected this section with two #0 TCUs after trying to fiddle in small wireds.

Orange Sunshine,105922178,Trad,105922171,5.10b,70,1,3.6,89.0,"Orange Sunshine hooked me on climbing.  Of course, I'd already been playing with the hook; I'd blown off much of my senior year of college bouldering at the UW Rock.  But on a warm summer evening in 1986, I discovered there was more to climbing than contriving moves on concrete.  The rock was bathed in the light of an amazing sunset.  Orange lichen glowed around the splitter sweep of the crack.  The sound of the river and the strong scent of sagebrush carried up from the canyon below.  I was toproping my first 5.10, and I was elated and surprised as I moved higher and higher without falling.  Eventually I did fall, but I was just as satisfied when I figured out the sequence of overhanging finger locks and footwork that ends the route.  When I awoke the next morning, Orange Sunshine was the first thing I thought of.    The crack begins as a flake that you can alternately jam and lieback, with good edges for the feet.  The first crux (5.10-) comes below a prominent break, where the crack narrows to finger pods.  You can cop a rest at the break, but then the true crux starts:  a gently overhanging flake, followed by pumpy finger locks with small edges and smears for the feet.  An insecure mantle provides a final surprise.

There are great holds for clipping the next two bolts, but the sequences between them demand attention. The bolts eventually switch to the left side of the crack, and you'll probably want to switch your alliances as well. Your first test comes after this transition, and it wont be an easy one.

What emerged from the rubble is a very fun addition to the wall, and a reminder that its worth the work to dig below the surface and get to know a place and a community beyond the lifted trucks and confederate flags (aka choss) that you first see. This route took more than 20 hours of cleaning, but proved to be every bit worth the effort.   Start by making a series of mantles on positive holds to the second bolt. The angle steepens through the next two bolts but massive holds keep the climbing reasonable. Clipping the chain-draw signifies the beginning of the crux, where a series of challenging moves leads to a pair of blocky underclings below a roof. The final roof encounter involves serious body tension between amazing side-pulls and a high foot that may have you waving like a flag  if your technique isn't quite right.

The route meanders all over the NW Face to follow the path of least resistance to the top.  It is characterized by mostly 3rd-class hiking on dirty ledges, with a couple of short stretches of 4th-and 5th-class rock, on which the FA party, and others shortly thereafter, fixed long iron rods into the rock to aid their ascent up these ""impossible"" sections (no harder than 5.7 by modern standards).       Start hiking up a left-trending dirty 3rd-class ramp just to the left of the clean (ish) face at the base of the NW Face just above the large boulders.  The first iron spike is within 50', so you will know that you are on route.  You will reach a modern bolted anchor after about 250' on route (well-after the first switchback, and just above the first bit of 4th-class rock) that you can use to belay the crux pitch above:  60' of dirty 4th-class followed by a 40' 5.7 dihedral.

Go to the back of the large ledge and climb the short crack using the block of Damocles. (You’ll pull and stand on that thing. I have reefed on it to no avail but your mileage may vary.) If you protect the crack, it is recommended to extend the sling before continuing to alleviate rope drag. On the next rightward sloping ledge move to the far left side to find good holds ascending a slab past 3 bolts to yet another big ledge. Again consider how to manage rope drag on this pitch by extending slings.The last part of this pitch ascends either an off width crack on the left (bring bigger gear if wanting to do this) or the face to the right.

The Steamboat Captain's Dream,111786929,Trad,111087716,5.10d,700,8,3.5,26.0,"In 1901 Frank Smith, a steamboat captain, and his party made the first ascent of Beacon Rock via the northwest face on what is now commonly known as the Spike Route. This route is named in his honor. For more on this history, watch the short film Beacon Rock Then & Now.  The Steamboat Captain's Dream is a link up of a few existing pitches from a couple of different routes together with newly opened pitches. The line stays true with the character of the opening pitch and offers more varied and superb climbing on the way to the true summit of Beacon Rock.  While most of Beacon Rock is closed to climbing annually from February until early July, the NW section of the rock remains open year round. This route is a great option for those looking for a multi-pitch adventure earlier in the season. The 5.10 nature of the route will keep you reaching into your bag of trad tricks and will ask for a wide variety of climbing skill as the route offers everything from low angle slab to slightly steeper terrain and thin crack to wide flakes.  Pitch 1 5.10B, 28m -  Ascend large ledges and good holds to a wider left leaning crack. The first gear is about 20' up in this crack but the climbing is straight forward to this point. Continue up as the route zig-zags its way up the wall following a discontinuous crack system, look carefully for offset nuts and small to medium cam placements eventually reaching a stance below where the rock steepens. Here find a good cam placement in a horizontal slot to compliment the older baby angle piton. Launch into the pitch's crux by moving up, passing a bolt and then exiting left around a buttress. Once you turn the corner, look for good features and a few more gear placements as you take the slab up to a bolted anchor. Due to the nature of the rock on this pitch some of the gear placements are not obvious but they're definitely available to the skilled trad climber. Appreciate the fact that the FFA of this pitch was done without the bolt!  For the most part (except a slightly different start) this pitch was originally called Smoke Signals.  Pitch 2 5.10D 32m - head up a weakness on the right of the anchors passing a small tree on its left side. Continue up the discontinuous crack finding good stances between reachy moves on good holds. Clip a bolt and step left on to a slab, working across the slab below a small roof towards another bolt. Climb up towards a small tree passing it on the right side and then on to the final crux head wall. The head wall has bolts, a pin and can take a couple of nuts if required. Plenty of gear can be found on this pitch. Offset nuts will be very useful on this pitch, especially the #7/gold size.  Move the belay about 25' up above the trees and to a comfortable ledge with anchors.  Pitch 3 5.10C 25m - continue up the short 15' right facing corner just right of the belay anchor and the short cracks above. Weave through a series of ledges and traverse left into a stance behind a large tree, a larger cam can be placed here. Lay back the big flake past 2 bolts and then traverse right across the face to find the next anchors just above.  Pitch 4 5.10A 18m - climb the low angle left leaning crack passing a piton mid way. Clipping the last bolt of Stone Soup's bolt ladder at the exit is fair game if needed. Find a belay station on the face to the left after you exit on to the comfy ledge. The micro-cams are useful on this pitch.  Pitch 5 5.6 20m - make a step up a 6' corner and follow the low angle ledges passing 2 bolts to an anchor below a steep arete and behind a tree.  Pitch 6 5.10C 30m - head straight up the arete following a line of bolts to a small roof. Step right, through the roof and continue up the ridge past a short crack to a set of anchors above a small ledge on the face.  Pitch 7 5.9 30m - from the belay move right and up a crack and corner system passing a bolt, a piton and another bolt. Continue following the discontinuous crack until it hits a shallow roof, step right at the roof and continue up following a couple more bolts as the terrain eases. A final belay can be found at a comfortable stance. Be careful as some of the blocks are loose.  Pitch 8 4th class 30m - climb a couple of steps and follow the easy terrain along the ridge crest for 100' to reach the Beacon Rock trail.  VARIATIONS  Pitch 1 var. 5.11A - A direct finish to the exit on the first pitch can be climbed. After stepping left and up from the bolt, follow a direct line to the top on good holds requiring some longer reaches. Small to medium nuts are useful for this option. FFA Stephen Shostek, Jul-10-2020  DESCENT  If you complete the route then walk down the Beacon Rock hiking trail back to your car, shoes or flip flops recommended. Otherwise rappel from any pitch with a 70m rope.  Notes: (i) When rappelling from the anchors at the top of pitch 5, angle down the 5.6 low angle pitch to get to the top of pitch 4 and the hand lines which lead you to the next rappel anchors. (ii) From the top of pitch 2, rappel from the anchors near the edge of the wall and not the anchors behind the trees on the spacious ledge.

Moderate laybacks will take you to a triangle ledge just below a splitter seam. Tech your way though a few pieces of small gear until you reach a good undercling. Reach high, clip the fixed pin (bomber) and cast off into the crux and through to the P1 anchor- 3 equalized pins with rap rings. These will eventually be replaced with bolts, but are bomber for now.Pitch 2: 12c ish 40mStem off the anchor and and clip some more old fixed gear. Pull into a stance below the giant detached block (don't place gear behind this geological time bomb! - two new bolts higher up now protect this section), place a pice (in the corner) and move into the meat of the pitch.

Its an adventurous climb with some serious sections and classic basalt features.    Pitch 1:  5.8 Climb the first pitch of Young Warriors.  This pitch contains many bolts and several optional small gear placements low on the pitch.    Pitch 2:  5.9 From the top of pitch 1 of Y.W. climb straight above the slung p1 anchor until you can move right onto short ledge leading to a shallow right-leaning, left facing dihedral. Climb this dihedral and the arete formed by it until it turns vertical and then go straight up to a small ledge with bolted anchors.    Pitch 3:  5.11 This crux pitch goes up from the right end of the small ledge and up broad and steep left facing dihedral. Climb the diherdal until you can't free climb any higher and you'll be at a changing corners area. Either aid two moves or and traverse right around arete (crux).  This move can be protected by a two medium size cam placed up in the underside of the angled slash going out right. Above the crux continue up and right. Once you reach a good ledge the pitch continues up and left straight up a rough looking face to a ledge and anchor above it. [However, up and right of the first good ledge is another anchor that can be used to bail the route with two ropes which will get you back down to the Boardwalk p1 anchor. This is effectively the last point to bail.]    Pitch 4:  5.10+ Move out right from the anchor up a steep slab and protect with loweballs and a pin to a steep mantle.  Clip fixed pin and then climb up under a large roof.  Pull roof through the left side slot and climb right and then left above the roof to an anchor on yellow rock in an low angle slab alcove.    Pitch 5:  5.9 Move left around a corner and up diagonally left angling cracks on a face to top out. The crux of this pitch is through an obvious confluence of cracks; at the crux there are three wedged shield shaped rocks which are slightly loose. Carefully use the leftmost rock and move up to the final moves which go slightly right to top out with an interesting twist. Head up to the large 'bonsai' looking tree and belay from there.    Pitch 6 / Descent:  At the large bonsai tree you have reached the lower part of the overall high SE Corner ridge ramp. Continue up the ramp which joins with both the SE Face and Young Warriors routes for the final 6th pitch up the upper ramp. At the top of the ramp before the trees unrope. Exit left for about 30' (north, away from the river) and follow switchback trail up the guardrail and tourist trail and take it back down to the parking lot.

After 25 meters, the route transitions to vertical at a shallow right facing corner. At the vertical section, look for a fixed angle pin which can be backed up with a cam, then a 3/8 bolt, followed by discontinuous cracks and pods that accept stoppers and cams up to 1.5 inches.

The second pitch is a different story. If the second pitch was cleaned and a few bolts added it would be a recommended climb. Currently I cannot recommend the second pitch unless you are very bold and skilled at mid-5.10 run out. If cleaned it would probability be 5.9/5.10a R. The R rating could be removed with a few bolts.    P1: Simply follow the bolts for 80’ to a bolt anchor. There are 6 bolts and if you want to supplement the bolts with gear, a few small cams and or small to medium nuts would be more then enough.

Walk left along this ledge to find the bolted belay anchor. 25m  P4: Ascend the wide crack by laybacking and utilizing face holds and pull over an awkward bulge reaching a ledge with an oak tree. Climb past the tree and into another easier layback right facing corner. Another short step takes you to Grassy Ledges where you can belay from a tree. 30m  RIGHT GULL ALTERNATE VARIATIONS 5.9  P1: Climb Little Wing and link into the second pitch from the piton ledge: make an airy step across to the next pillar and climb the right facing corner to its top. From here climb the crack directly above this pillar (VULCAN'S VARIATION, 5.8) to belay on the next ledge building an anchor with gear. 40m  P2: Climb the offwidth to hand-sized crack to another large ledge. Walk left along this ledge to find the bolted belay anchor. 15m  P3: Ascend the wide crack by laybacking and utilizing face holds and pull over an awkward bulge reaching a ledge with an oak tree.

Almost every climbable weekend will see ascents.  Finding the start of this route can be a challenge. Go down the climbers trail on the East side of Beacon. After turning the corner watch for a rise in terrain. Just past the rise the route starts in a right angling corner.

Belay from a bolted anchor  Pitch 2: 3rd class Traverse down a few feet and then straight right for a pitch. Belay at bolted anchors. Pro is sparse but the climbing is easy. Most people link pitch one and two.  P3: 5.7 Pull the steep mantle immediately up and left of the anchor and continue up the ramp above (or the right-leaning, right-facing dihedral just left of the ramp) until you have pulled a couple of vertical moves past some old pins. Make a short traverse to your right, around the corner, to a hand crack, and then head straight up for a short distance to the large belay ledge with tree. Do not belay off the tree! 30m.

Anchors for Jill's Thrill are down and to the left, around a slight rock outcropping. Ignore these if continuing to the top. 40m.  P5: Walk left along the dirty ledge for a very short distance then turn right up a wide, shallow gully that is littered with dirt and loose rock. The short offwidth is at the top, and slightly to the right, of this gully. I personally prefer to build an anchor here at the top of the offwidth. ~20m.  P6: Head up and right along the low-angle ramp, and clip the ancient bolt off to your left at the top (for the rope) before walking right along a ledge a short distance and around a bit of a corner. Go straight up the face above you and build an anchor on the large ledge at the top. ~40m.  P7: Many people solo this pitch as it's unexposed and easy (5.4?). Go up and left from the ledge, taking the line of least resistance up the low-angle ridge/spine of clean rock.

His write up about a bold, hard and slightly crazy line captivated me and has stayed in the back of my mind. Hard roofs, loose blocks and not a lot of pro. Healy had attempted pitch 3 previously. Andrew Traylor and I began a ground up ascent to finish off this route. We placed two bolts on lead and one anchor for pitch 3. Pitch 1: 5.7 Begin up Rhythm Method, a nicely bolted face climb.Pitch 2: 5.10+ R From the Rhythm Method anchor, head right and then up into the large dihedral system. Quoting Joe's description, ""goes up the right facing dihedral through two roofs exiting left to an anchor on the face once the dihedral starts to slant right."" It's a long pitch with some good climbing highlighted by runouts (there is one bolt, two pitons and a fixed stopper/ball nut on this pitch). It shouldn't be taken lightly. Serious fall potential and one enormous loose block after the fixed stopper and ball nut makes for a spooky lead. Pitch 3: 12 c/d R Head right (bolt) and then venture up some not so inspiring rock, clipping a few pitons and intermittent gear. Under the roof the rock quality improves. Rest up for some exciting climbing (jam/chimney/stem/boulder) and unleash your wild grunts for the last hard move out the lip. Over the lip, work your way up the Texas Death Flake and then climb right (save a #4 Metolius for up here). Continue up and eventually back left to a bolted anchor about 30 feet above the lip. The crux section of this pitch is primo!Pitch 4: 11a Climb straight up and clip a bolt. Pull up onto the face and then traverse left (fun). Head up and eventually step around the buttress. Some mossy climbing (hopefully I'll get back to clean this section) leads up a ramp and then to a one bolt anchor (easily supplemented with gear). You've met up with Lost Warriors at this belay stance.Pitch 5: 11a From this anchor, go up and gain access to the slab above. Mantle onto it and traverse right (super cool!). Crux culminates with a fun mantle onto the summit ridge - airy and fantastic! We found an old piton up here, but are unsure if this section of amazing rock was ever freed?

The next pitch, amazing, continuously hard, and long (I'm a bit biased, but I would say again that this pitch is stellar), follows the dihedral left of the belay (which consists of one great bolt and one not so inspiring bolt).  Climb the thin seam and pull onto some face holds (crux #1) and then rest on a slopey hold before entering a very balancey and techy section (crux #2).  Relax and keep it together through the next 15 or so feet before entering crux #3, a pull of a left hand side pull to a good right hand edge!

Pitch 2 (5.7):  Shoot for the obvious medium-sized cedar perched on a ledge about 15 meters above.  Use its branches to gain the ledge (a unique crux!) and continue for a few moves up to the left, before traversing right less than 5 meters to reach the belay from a small fir tree (rap rings) and bolt.
