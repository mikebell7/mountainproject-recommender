The second pitch provides an exhibit of many of the different types of harware-store-variety gear (bolts, nails, you name it).  Obviously, all of it is suspicious.  Fortunately, the climbing on the second pitch is rather easy and the gear becomes a  curiosity rather than an objective hazard.  The top anchor above pitch 2 is difficult to build.    From the top of the route, make an exposed 3rd class traverse left until reaching a gully(some parties may want to belay this as a third pitch).  Descend the gully to a large rappel tree.

The route follows an undulating crack which occasionally masquerades as a shallow corner.  The crack ranges from a few millimeters wide to about 8 inches (although no gear over 3-inches is absolutely necessary).  The gear is good and the climbing is fairly sustained.  Unlike Ending Crack, which has abundant face holds on either side, this route forces you to use the crack--expect plenty of fist jamming and even a little off-width climbing.      The top of the route features a bolted anchor--2 glued-in eye-bolts and a Fixe Triplex.  It takes two ropes to reach the ground.    The most unusual feature of this route is that it seldom has any dry ground beneath it.  This means that you will likely have to build a hanging belay in a large hole about 8 feet above the water.  Keeping the rope dry is an excellent test of your rope management skills.  When you pull the rappel lines, one of your ropes is surely getting wet.

Consider leading the first six bolts of Economique, extending the seventh with a long runner, and finishing on the anchors of Goulara--this is a great way to TR Economique's classic nextdoor neighbor.","{105798149: 4, 110200383: 4, 108286368: 4, 200146843: 4, 200101945: 4, 200461533: 4, 108602511: 4, 109132699: 4, 200452040: 4, 200070145: 4, 111022636: 4, 109629902: 4, 112105385: 4, 107679859: 4, 108135917: 4, 111065591: 4, 107833703: 4, 200801380: 4, 200514246: 4, 111621406: 4, 107398828: 4, 200727794: 4, 107097996: 4, 200237205: 3, 200065376: 3, 107178013: 3, 200301854: 3, 108418119: 3, 200043955: 3, 112457903: 3, 200364465: 3, 200355226: 3, 200280192: 3, 200231221: 3, 200566754: 3, 111745195: 3, 200040598: 3, 200531112: 3, 200838657: 3, 107866466: 3, 105990845: 3, 108107173: 3, 108295473: 3, 107794772: 3, 107520348: 3, 106341198: 3, 107362991: 3, 106519623: 3, 107993050: 3, 106932131: 3, 106073856: 3, 109521445: 3, 110261354: 3, 111442565: 3, 111928469: 3, 111007195: 3, 107777777: 3, 109365728: 3, 108902078: 3, 110109817: 3, 200894600: 2, 200319086: 2, 107650213: 2, 106351073: 2, 200452863: 2, 109585594: 2, 112502218: 2, 200401739: 2, 106998548: 2, 200251132: 2, 112341274: 2, 106816785: 2, 10481: 2, 200544664: 2, 111755066: 1, 200239950: 0, 105935712: 0}"

This climb includes route finding difficulties, loose rock, well spaced bolts, poor belays, pigeons, and some of the most improbable climbing you'll find anywhere. That said, it is some of the best adventure climbing you'll find with a real alpine feel.  From the west side parking lot, you'll need about 8 hours ""car to car"" for the whole adventure. See approach & descent description below. This is rated ""only"" 5.8 but would not be a good route for someone just breaking into that grade.  Pitch 1  5.5: From the stacked boulders, work your way left up a short ramp (sling the small tree for protection) then head right using a few chimney moves. Scramble into the HUGE chamber and belay off two new bolts on the right wall.  Pitch 2  3rd & 4th Class: Pick up the belay and move to the far end of the chamber. Youll have to do a few chimney moves to get to the start of the next pitch. You'll have passed under the large chockstone and be at the highest point just before the floor starts to drop.  Pitch 3  5.6: This improbable pitch, chimneys and stems its way back toward the chockstone 70 over your head. From the highest point of the chamber floor, (facing back toward the chockstone), look up about 15 on the right wall and youll see your first bolt. Youll clip two bolts on the right wall and then switch and clip 2 bolts on the left wall (4 total). Somewhere around bolt 3 youll need to switch from stemming/chimneying to climbing the left wall. At the top, cross over the chockstone and belay from the shrub/small tree.  Pitch 4  5.8: Move the belay from the small tree to the base of a water chute/chimney. You should be standing beneath 2 closely spaced bolts. The crux of this pitch is making it past the 1st bolt. There are a total of 3 bolts on this pitch. Once at the top move through a scree filled trough and belay from a small tree at the back of the chute.  Pitch 5  5.6: Move the belay north (right) to the base of another water chute/chimney. Start just right of the water chute, clip one bolt, then move left into the chimney and clip one more bolt. Belay from another small tree at the back of the meadow.  Pitch 6  5.3: Move the belay right, past the most obvious pinnacle, just below a short wall (about 10). Climb the short wall (no protection), then move right and climb another short, unprotected wall (about 15) to the top of a pinnacle. Belay by placing a large loop or rope over the pinnacle to your right.  Pitch 7  5.4: Climb down 10 and then up a small face past one bolt. From the top of this face, walk down and left and belay at one bolt in front of another face.  Pitch 8  5.4: Step out left onto an exposed ledge, clip 1 bolt, then move right up a ramp and clip another bolt as you move to the top of the pinnacle. Work your way over a series of humps and clip 1 more bolt before reaching the south summit of H & L Dome. Belay from 2 old bolts on the south summit.  Pitch 9  5.1: Downclimb from the south summit then climb back up to the north summit.

Swallow Crack,105735362,Trad,105734225,5.6,90,1,2.6,98.0,"This is located in the middle of the east face of the Discovery Wall, uphill where the climbers path begins to flatten out. From the path, head up about 15 feet to a large open area, where you will find the bulge that leads to the Swallow Crack.  Start on a bulgy face that leads to a wide left faced crack on a slab where excellent hands and feet are available. There is certainly some rock that will eventually pull out on this route, so use caution! After the crack, move left to the bolt, and climb some class 4 rock that will lead you to the top of the Discovery Wall.  This route is about 90 feet long, and due to the leftward movement of the route, top roping this roue either requires some interesting directionals and a long rope, or some ballsy climbers. A fall on a top rope from the anchors will swing you about 50 feet left and crash you into the slabby section of Fly-By (5.9+), the next climb over.","{10574: 4, 107316971: 4, 110316493: 4, 111662608: 4, 110146121: 4, 111999168: 4, 108576301: 4, 111877213: 4, 106998548: 4, 200172373: 3, 110787063: 3, 108341962: 3, 110729900: 3, 112457903: 3, 106348320: 3, 108873434: 3, 109558458: 3, 200867312: 3, 109958232: 3, 107892961: 3, 111892796: 3, 200272801: 3, 111722665: 3, 200047725: 3, 110543722: 3, 108193337: 3, 200382261: 3, 112117523: 3, 200268577: 3, 200128311: 3, 110402551: 3, 111531597: 3, 107287670: 3, 107065971: 3, 107108404: 3, 107333295: 3, 106632840: 3, 106266430: 3, 107974040: 3, 107936725: 3, 106784621: 3, 107722979: 3, 107779884: 3, 106119518: 3, 105808148: 3, 105860480: 3, 107239484: 3, 106176621: 3, 107252434: 3, 13662: 3, 110763188: 2, 105892730: 2, 112161744: 2, 200048877: 2, 10359: 2, 112518615: 2, 111307550: 2, 111650956: 2, 200064029: 2, 111898888: 2, 111252787: 2, 10481: 2, 109357643: 2, 105837833: 2, 110687795: 2, 200123269: 2, 14015: 2, 105895329: 2, 200169074: 2, 107485843: 2, 108680629: 2, 111874046: 2, 108039486: 2, 109642480: 2, 105831184: 2, 109881922: 2, 109479762: 2, 106297607: 2, 108277022: 2, 108088424: 2, 108395152: 2, 107698967: 2, 109926397: 2, 106435914: 2, 106662918: 2, 112359184: 2, 110965145: 2, 106918913: 2, 107890277: 2, 107360897: 2, 106943598: 2, 106120889: 2, 107184020: 2, 110423556: 2, 108065923: 2, 200476842: 1, 15116: 1, 111887607: 1}"

This one-pitch route is on the north side of Condor Crag - South, but is included here because it is so close to routes on Condor Crag - North’s north side. It starts on top of a thin rock fin, 50 feet right of The Great Chimney. Start by moving down and stemming to the first bolt (it’s at the same height as the top of the fin). Move up and right past two bolts and then up past two more. Although the route’s first five bolts are easy to see from the rock fin, no others are visible. Bolt six is 30 feet above bolt five and bolt seven is 25 feet higher. One more bolt protects climbing to a two-bolt anchor 145 feet from the rock fin (eight lead bolts total). Descend by rappel.

The topo on that page shows two bolts low in the streak (those two bolts were placed in the early 1980s and the line was abandoned after that). The climb consists now of three pitches. On the first pitch (5.10b), twelve bolts lead first straight up, and then to the right of the streak, before moving to the left across it and then sharply right back into it. Finish the pitch 90 feet up at a two-bolt belay on top of huge lodestones. Pitch two (5.10d) starts on the route's well-protected, crux headwall. A total of ten bolts on this pitch lead 80 feet to a two-bolt anchor at a stance. Pitch three (5.10b) starts with a crux past two bolts. Continue into a low-angle, scoop area and a third bolt. A fourth bolt above protects a second crux onto a magnificent, huge (six foot diameter) lodestone. Two more bolts protect the pitch's third crux to the top of the cliff and a two-bolt anchor, 70 feet from its start. Full Circle ends here (this anchor is at the top of the cliff). Note too that the first ascent party also installed a ""fourth anchor"" that isn't really part of the climb, but is above/behind it. This additional two-bolt anchor is located 55 feet mostly-horizontal feet back from the top of Full Circle's third and last pitch, at the base of the next tier of The Balconies. This location is also 150 feet right (south) and slightly up from the top anchor of the route Lava Falls (but again at the base of the next tier back). The anchor was installed to allow parties to rappel down this part of The Balconies with one rope (one 55 foot walk/rappel from the anchor on the upper/next tier leads to the top of Full Circle's third pitch, and three one-rope rappels continue from there to the ground).","{14305: 4, 106415187: 2, 200386566: 2, 107822334: 1}"

The route starts 100 yards to the south (climber's right) of If We Bolt It They Will Come (route number 711 in the 2007 guidebook). The start is also to the right of the large class three/four ramp which leads up to the routes Desperate Abandon and Gold Line (neither of which is in the guidebook).    To find The Inn Crowd, look for a slight, up-and-right weakness/ramp that allows passage between upper and lower rotten headwalls. The first bolt on the route can be seen about 20 feet above the ground (the climbing to this bolt is very easy). A total of ten bolts on the first pitch lead up and right (at about a 45 degree angle) 115 feet to a three bolt belay on a beach ball size lodestone (bring and use slings on this pitch). The second pitch continues right past one bolt and then continues straight up past five more to another three bolt anchor (six bolts total on this pitch). It is 75 feet from the top of the first pitch to the top of the second.    Descend by scrambling down the class four Desperate Abandon ramp (start with a very exposed scramble from the second pitch bolt anchor onto the ramp), or by rappel. Note, while this route can be rappelled with one rope, and while the rappel from the top of the second pitch to the top of the first is only 75 feet, the rappel from the top of the first pitch to the ground is 118 feet (the last 50 of which are completely overhanging) and this second rappel requires a 70 meter rope!    The Inn Crowd is a very sunny climb; it's in the sun from early morning until the sun sets. It is a good route for cold days (although it is located on the part of The Balconies that close for raptor breeding each January through July). It also offers great views and wonderful exposure.    Finally, two further items of explanation: First, the second pitch of this route ends at a stance on a steeper section of wall just below the ramp and about 20 feet below the one protection bolt on the old ""discovered"" route Desperate Abandon. The route ends here so that no bolts were added to or within sight of Desperate Abandon and so that the well protected nature of The Inn Crowd was not ""diluted"" by joining/finishing on the fairly run out upper part of that route. Second, the well protected nature of The Inn Crowd should be understood (and forgiven) since the combined ages of the first ascentionists exceed 350 years.

The rock is surprisingly solid and the climb is very well protected for a 4-pitch 5.4 (original rating) sport climb. Be careful not to dislodge small rocks on the ledges, which could bounce down the route. Some bolts are very closely spaced (especially pitch 3). There are several runouts on very easy terrain (5.0 or easier).    Pitch 1: 5.4 (crux at start), 120', 7 bolts. After clipping the first bolt, aim up and left to the arete to find the second bolt; it's runout but very easy, like 5.0, and you can sling knobs if you feel uncomfortable. Attach a long runner to bolt 2 or you'll feel rope drag higher up. Afterward the bolts are closely spaced. Belay at bolts at the edge of a huge ledge.    Pitch 2: 5.3, 95' (or 80'), 6 bolts. If you wish, you can shift the belay to another set of bolts 15' from the edge of the ledge, at the base of pitch 2. Follow four closely spaced bolts up a groove and then traverse up and left past two more bolts, across the arete, to a bolted anchor with a small belay stance on the face.    Pitch 3: 5.3, 85', 3 bolts. Climb up and then left toward the first bolt, which is a few feet to the left of a big hole, then up past two more bolts to a bolted anchor on a large ledge.    Pitch 4: 5.2, 90', 4 bolts. Climb up past a bolt and then surprisingly far to the left to bolt 2, then up past two more bolts to a bolted anchor on a large ledge just below the summit. From the anchor, scramble 10' up a class 4 bulge to the summit; to be safe you can tie off about 20' of rope to the anchor.    The quickest and safest descent is rappelling the route, but if climbers are beneath you be very careful throwing down the rope and try not to knock small rocks off the ledges. A 70 m rope will get you down in four rappels. A 60 m rope will leave you stranded 15' above the ground at the first bolt of pitch 1, which should have a quick link on it for a fifth rappel. Two ropes will get you down in three rappels (pitch 4, pitches 2-3, and pitch 1).","{107184020: 4, 107620610: 4, 107442972: 4, 106176621: 4, 108220249: 4, 109686833: 4, 112318210: 4, 111729965: 4, 200075415: 4, 108576301: 4, 200048877: 4, 200243983: 4, 107311020: 4, 200188410: 4, 107892961: 4, 200137496: 4, 7031852: 4, 200271493: 4, 200209653: 4, 200476178: 4, 200413957: 4, 200437813: 4, 109568258: 4, 110849945: 4, 108873434: 4, 200442336: 4, 107689423: 3, 107737279: 3, 107997991: 3, 106426493: 3, 107433201: 3, 108036988: 3, 106943598: 3, 108118087: 3, 107024511: 3, 106707702: 3, 108453083: 3, 109449140: 3, 110268404: 3, 109711221: 3, 108608330: 3, 110348202: 3, 109583584: 3, 111918589: 3, 111874046: 3, 112081699: 3, 108341962: 3, 108088424: 3, 111741670: 3, 108870954: 3, 111236373: 3, 110807785: 3, 112234511: 3, 112529892: 3, 111891997: 3, 110851976: 3, 107739770: 3, 107779884: 3, 111030095: 3, 110522204: 3, 109690248: 3, 110316493: 3, 200122961: 3, 108355917: 3, 200170191: 3, 108193337: 3, 107106099: 3, 200095215: 3, 200219211: 3, 200169710: 3, 200207581: 3, 108746410: 3, 200248448: 3, 200190767: 3, 109538554: 3, 200232158: 3, 111621406: 3, 200033425: 3, 112291215: 3, 107002874: 3, 111650956: 3, 110961130: 3, 112105385: 3, 200239126: 3, 109357643: 3, 200400612: 3, 200444961: 3, 200450196: 3, 112571900: 3, 200172373: 3, 200476842: 3, 110941646: 3, 111155545: 3, 200527762: 3, 108253198: 3, 110298197: 3, 110878214: 3, 200630235: 3, 200674357: 3, 200095226: 3, 200524808: 3, 200128311: 3, 200438482: 3, 200381770: 3, 200624878: 3, 108191533: 3, 112478418: 3, 106348320: 2, 106399334: 2, 108525921: 2, 110317116: 2, 109881922: 2, 112415525: 2, 111682687: 2, 111872458: 2, 110801668: 2, 110543722: 2, 200042693: 2, 200175242: 2, 200194507: 2, 112521963: 2, 108445221: 2, 112342751: 2, 111726721: 2, 200077815: 2, 200552300: 2, 108832532: 1, 112420120: 1}"

It's at least 3/4 of a mile back on the trail, and another 20 - 30 minutes back down a windy road to get some help.  On weekends and holidays there are lots of hikers in the Balconies Caves and trail.  Non-holiday weekdays are best for doing this route.  Except for the first and fourth pitches, 5.10 is the rule of thumb. Not just crux moves, in many sections there are over 50 feet of 5.9 or harder continuous moves. Loose rock is also the rule of thumb, so tap before you weight anything.  To approach this climb, head down the trail approaching Machete Ridge to the far side of the rock. Head into the cave area which involves going through the metal gate. Head up and right when you can just at the end of the cave over some 4th - 5th class boulders, which puts you on a wide bushless grassy knoll. There is a long bolted ramp that goes up and right above a tree, and this is where the climb starts.  Pitch 1:  The first pitch is merely a 4th class ramp, that heads up and right to a 5.7 slab section near the top. There is a set of old rusty anchors and the end of the ramp that you should pass, and around the corner you'll find a cave that allows for a nice belay.  Pitch 2: Cuidado! There is genuine factor 2 fall potential here, and it is the crux of the route, on Pinnacles ""rock"". I recommend belaying with a GriGri, and set your belayer hanging 5'-10' below the belay- this neutralizes the fall factor.  The the first bolt is just 4' due left of the belay, then you'll head almost directly up 5 bolts of the most overhung 5.10+ climbing on the route. Some of the holds are loose, others are REALLY loose. put a long runner on the bolt before heading left for some sustained 5.8 - 5.9 traverse undercling and balance fun. Pull a 5.9 bulge move which takes you back right (more long slings around this 13 degree turn), to the second belay, which isn't nearly as comfortable as the first.  Pitch 3:  The third pitch offers you a nice break at first, and then really sustained 5.10 overhung fun for the last 2/3 of the route. Continue up and right through some very runout (and loose) 5.7 - 5.8 slab climbing. A sharp left and then right turn from the third to fifth bolts requires a little more sling assistance to avoid making the 5.10+ section later feel like 5.11+. The less adventuresome can use slings around some of the larger knobs for additional protection on the bottom section. There is a seven bolt 5.10 section at the top of this pitch that offers little let up, and an awesome pump over mostly vertical terrain. 3 bolts await up top, and be prepared to get worshipped for leading the previous pitch so your partner didn't have to.  Pitch 4:  A good rest before a final 5.10 section in the final pitch. A short 3 bolt low fifth class section on loose rock (what else?) and some moss and lichen. Yuck. A badly needed rest after the previous pitch. A 2 bolt anchor awaits.  Pitch 5:  To the top. Walk around the corner from the belay onto a horizontal ramp. Walk over to the depression in the rock, and pull one last 5.10b overhung move over a lip to get your into a large bowl. A final tough 5.9 move pushes you over one more lip, and into a simple scramble to the top in another larger bowl. Bolts await up top.  To descend, walk across the ridge to the far side of this small false summit on Machete Ridge. The belay bolts are a pain to find, but drop you off the back into a gully a long ways down. Scramble down the sketchy gully to the base area, using ropes if you think you're going to slide and keep going. You'll be let out finally onto a small ramp, which will put you about 75 feet left of the start of the route.","{10574: 4, 200403951: 4, 108423624: 4, 107205233: 4, 14305: 4, 109257815: 4, 108873434: 4, 107311020: 4, 107184020: 4, 108148358: 4, 108074697: 4, 200555116: 3, 200489381: 3, 110801668: 3, 106348320: 3, 110904756: 3, 200061573: 3, 108723479: 3, 200172373: 3, 107360897: 2, 112359184: 1}"
Old Original,106912474,Trad,119014645,5.5,800,6,2.7,51.0,"This is truly more of an adventure that a traditional rock climb. Not much of it is vertical, not a whole lot is 5th class, but its all quite fun, and very beautiful. Route-finding was definitely the challenge of the day  both on the approach, as well as throughout the route. I printed out a slew of trip reports/beta from various websites and we still stumbled around a bit to find our way. Various reports rate this 5.3-5.7  I felt there was definitely not a move harder than 5.5. Hopefully this beta will be some of the better stuff out there  and help get you spending more time on the route, and less time trying to find it.PLEASE READ: Starting in 2018 there has been a pretty consistent yearly condor nest on this route.  The first California Condor to fledge at the Pinnacles in over 100 years came from this nest. Please check with the Park Service web page, the Friends of Pinnacles website and the CrudnMud forum to see if this route is closed during the raptor nesting season and possibly longer.We did this in a team of 4 (with 2 ropes), and had 1 person tie in short on the 2nd rope. We simul-rappeled a few times to speed things up  generally the rappel stations were bomber and modern. (if simul-rapping, please be aware of the added risks and concerns). We left the parking lot at noon, and were back to the car by 6, including a fair amount of time wandering around on the approach semi-lost, casual climbing (with 2 folks who had minimal experience outdoors), and a nice lunch up on top. Pack layers  it can be alternately windy/cold/shady/hot based on where you are along the route.Gear I would highly encourage carrying two ropes (we brought 2x 60m). We passed a lot of intermediate belay stations that likely would have allowed for a single-rope raps, but 2 ropes gave us a lot more options, and sped things up. There were a few places where shorter rope might have gotten you to a decent spot, but longer ropes allowed us to get on the most secure ground possible.Everything is bolted  so a half dozen draws should suffice  we brought a few pieces that never left the pack and just added weight. There were very few spots for other protection anyway, just be prepared for easy but runout terrai. If you wanted to climb Middle Tower, a couple medium pieces to anchor a better below wouldnt hurt.Approach Follow the directions on the main page to west side of the park  taking Hwy 146 from Soledad. Jump on the Balconies Trail from the picnic/parking area, and walk about a half mile, passing most of the west face of Machete Ridge. There is a big obvious sign that says Machete Ridge climbing access to the right, just before a footbridge (maybe the 3rd or 4th bridge).Follow this trail up to the base, and head right (moving south), doubling back the way you came along the base. Continue to follow this trail ALL the way around the south side of Machete Ridge, and then back up around the back side (east) of the rocks. We had a hard time finding this  because we kept thinking we had gone too far. It feels like you almost do a complete lap around of the ridge  but after passing much of the east face, youll see two large pine trees up to the left between a saddle. There wasnt much of a trail, and you pass lots of confusing trees along the way  but these are 2 pines that are pretty much on their own, right up in the notch.Alternately  you could hike in from the east side of the park, meeting up with the Balconies Trail. Havent done this  but should be possible, and would take a few hours.Pitch 1 - 5.3: From the notch with the pine trees, scramble up the rock just before the 2nd pine. You will find a grassy ledge about 50 feet up, with a small pine tree on the north end. Just left of the tree you can see a small patch of bush/grass about 15 feet up on the left  with your first (fairly high) bolt just above that. Head up and left to that bolt, then move right to a 2nd bolt at your feet. Just above this youll fine 2 bolts at eye-level for the belay. Very short pitch.Pitch 2  walk (3rd/4th class): You can walk about 30 feet to a small notch on your right (before the tree). Dont climb down the notch  but hop up on the ridge to the right of the notch, doubling-back the way you came but on higher ground. Follow the exposed ridge down, with few (if any) options for protection. It might be possible to belay someone from the top of P1 bolts  but you wouldnt be able to see/hear each other well (the rope would start below the ridge, and go up and over the other side). We walked it  but it is exposed, and you have to down climb a bit on the last 25 feet to get to a gully, which is the start of Pitch 3.Pitch 3  5.5  There is a notch here with 3 bolts  2 newer solid ones, and a 3rd on an old/homemade hanger. This pitch involves a few short exposed moves moving right around a bulge. You can see the first bolt from the belay. Once you get around the bulge, you have a crouching traverse (at least for tall folks like me), past a 2nd bolt at your feet. Its an easy walk past the 2nd bolt, but I stayed roped in. 40 feet later the ridge flattens out, and you can climb an easy 8 notch up to the obvious grassy area with a few small Manzanita trees. I belayed from here off a manzanita (and we ate lunch).Pitch 4  walk (3rd/4th class): From the manzanitas  walk up and over the ridge to your right, following the ridge down to nice set of chains. Its an easy walk, but once again very airy and exposed. If you are concerned, you could belay from the Manzanita  but it would be mighty runout, and no real protection along the way.Pitch 5 - rappel  From these chains, we did did a double rope (60m each) rap to the NW gully below. Its a low-angle rappel on class 3 and 4rock (could be downclimbed easily) for most of it, but the last 30 or so are overhanging and a free rappel. We passed 2 intermediate rap stations that I would assume would allow for a single rope rappel.Pitch 6  scramble/rappel From the gully, you can either walk around right, or scramble over to another obvious gully. Youll see a U-shaped notch (not the W-shaped notch to the right). You can climb the notch (easy 5th class  but not 3rd class the way some guides state) Find a single bolt in the notch (left hand side), and either rap down, or downclimb the lichen-covered rock to a protected gully. You can scramble out of the gully, and over to the base of Middle Tower  where there is another rap station that ends the route.This is the official end of the route, but Middle Tower can be climbed as a side-excursion (2-bolt 5.5), or possibly traverse farther out towards the other towers.Descent [with updates from Brad Young 12/20]The descent isn’t hard but it does take some time. Start at a set of bolts on top of Machete Ridge at the base, south of Middle Tower (near a large lodestone). Rappel 60 feet off the east side of the formation (this is away from The Balconies, which are easy to see across the deep canyon to the west). This rappel leads into a mostly-rock gully that extends steeply down to the north. It used to be mandatory to scramble down this gully, but over time the rock there became smoother and smoother and so, by community consensus, three rappel stations were installed. These start about 30 feet below the point where the rappel into the gully ends (about 90 feet from the rappel anchor at the top of Machete). Scramble down the gully, or use these three stations to make three rappels down to a fairly large, fairly flat, meadowy area (all rappels are 85 feet or less).Move north to the far end of the meadow. Set up a belay by slinging a tree. Make a 125-foot, class four, level traverse northwest over the top of a slab. The traverse leads to the top of a gully. Follow this gully down toward the north end of the Balconies Cave. Make a choice as the gully gets wider: either veer right (due north) toward a grassy slope which leads to the Balconies Cave Trail (at a point north of the cave), or continue down and a little left (northwest) to a series of big boulders. Weave among these boulders (some exposure) to reach a metal handrail that is part of the Balconies Cave Trail. Follow the trail down into the cave and back toward parking.Note: although some parties have rappelled from a tree in the south end of the large, fairly flat meadow, that tree seems to be dying from these efforts, and may not be stable. This rappel also requires two ropes (on a climb that doesn’t need two ropes anywhere else). The class four traverse is overall easier and is also consistent with this “alpine” type of climbing.","{200403951: 4, 200094293: 4, 110904961: 4, 200075415: 4, 106176621: 4, 106120889: 4, 106415187: 4, 112386313: 4, 111650956: 4, 108005056: 4, 108525921: 4, 12312: 4, 108341962: 4, 200049121: 3, 14305: 3, 112420120: 3, 112117523: 3, 111873626: 3, 111729965: 3, 111950751: 3, 110801668: 3, 110051956: 3, 200473816: 3, 200095226: 3, 200172373: 3, 110775004: 3, 111918589: 3, 106348407: 3, 107114866: 3, 108576301: 3, 106916634: 3, 108220249: 3, 107460666: 3, 108870954: 3, 108913040: 2, 106033605: 2, 111738596: 2, 106794218: 2, 200459570: 2, 107698967: 2, 107849194: 2, 111874046: 2, 107497265: 2, 110729900: 2, 110302446: 2, 109722536: 1, 108130824: 1, 107360897: 1, 110908622: 0, 108039486: 0, 111612526: 0}"

Psalm 42 (Adela Hurtado Memorial Route),115397383,Sport,115397126,5.12-,30,1,3.0,1.0,"This short and steep face climb begins as an overhanging traverse in from the right on polished rock above water, gains a ledge, then continues climbing straight up the very steep face overhanging the pool below that is part of Morro Creek. It is a bouldery sequence and about 10 to 11 moves up sharp crimps, sloping edges, and a few jugs plus some easier initial moves up to bolt 1. The holds at the top of the route tend to get a bit dirty, so you may want to clean them beforehand.  Although short, this climb is in great setting above a pool of Morro Creek fed by a short waterfall, with the limestone cave nearby and riparian habitat surrounding the area. Hwy 41 is close by but the waterfall keeps intermittent traffic noise from detracting too much from the setting. The rock is a very hard, sharp, and rather brittle type of igneous rock (if you know the type, chime in). There are ferns that have established root systems in the horizontal seams and crevices and they sprout out leaves seasonally then dry up. If dead leaves are covering the large sloping ledge about half-way up, it's OK to remove them; they will grow back next season from the root systems.  During the time the idea of this climb was coming about, I used to frequent this area as a retreat from the stress of being overwhelmed with life. My wife's mother was just diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and my wife quit her job to become her care-taker along with her sister. I had began hand-drilling the rappel anchors at the top (there were originally 3 but the third one turned out to be in bad rock) and completed the task over several visits. I didn't have a power-drill at the time, but it was OK; banging away with the hammer on the hand drill for hours seemed a good way to take my mind off things. They took quite a while in the very hard rock and the required holes were rather large. Adela died shortly after her diagnoses, less than 3 months later. That's where the route name comes from. She was a beautiful person and lived a beautiful self-less life, growing up in rural Mexico in an agrarian lifestyle with no running water or electricity and eventually immigrating to the U.S., establishing a successfully business with her husband, and raising 4 children to their own successful lives. When I remember her, I like to think not about the tragedy but of the happiness and beauty she exuded. Visiting this beautiful little area close to home brings it back, the coolness of descending into the grotto, shade from the cliffs and trees, listening to the rush of the waterfall, seeing the ferns sprouting out of the rock, and doing some fun climbing to relax the mind.",{106361120: 3}

For the last five years I had been scoping out massive boulders that intersect, an occurrence which typically creates flaring hands-to-offwidth cracks of a gritty, desperate nature. On the backside of the Charlotte's Web boulder, just such a discovery languished in undiscovered glory. Some digging, scrubbing, taping, suffering, and lots of laughing resulted in a truly burly and surprisingly technical off width roof problem.     Beta:    Jugs and toe-jamming at the beginning, followed by hand-jams and side pulls. As you emerge from the cave, vicious arm-barring awaits. Once you figure out what to do with your feet, top the sucker out. Then vomit your lunch.     I have really no idea how hard to rate this thing, because it requires such a unique set of skills.

Whatever grade you give it, I posted V5 since that's what Ocean's Eleven and the old Edwards bouldering guide says.","{105942303: 3, 107111728: 3, 200313393: 2}"

The grade given here means nothing, really, unless you take my exact line.    Starting at the Tunnel Trailhead, hike up 7 Falls Canyon to the AFTC Crag. This crag is at the base of the Southeast Ridge of Arlington Peak (the most prominent rock ridge seen from town). I climbed the ""Direct Southeast Ridge"" - tackling the unnamed 5.8 sport route, continuing up the 5.6X arete, and then wandering around leftwards onto clean 5th class patina slab/face anytime serious bushwhacking presented itself. Approximately 4 short pitches from the canyon bottom to join the hiking trail on the ridge. This was completed solo, but could be pitched out with a short 30M rope and some draws/slings for bolts, bushes and trees. Gear could be used too, and if you plan to lead anything on Cathedral Peak you'll have it along anyways. Expect some 5.veg and runouts, and then enjoy the long slog to the the top of Arlington Peak. Tag on as many or few of the small-to-highball boulder pinnacles as you want on your way to the top. Dozens and dozens of mini-summits along the way. Many of these do not have easy-offs; downclimb or simul-rap to descend.    From Arlington Peak - continue along the trail northwest to Cathedral Peak. Drop down off the trail to the base of Cathedral Peak. Obviously, the best choice for Cathedral Peak is the South Face, 5.7 - 3 pitches. Many other 5th class options exist, along with a class-3 route on the north side.    From Cathedral Peak - descend 3rd class from the summit northwards and gain the steep trail leading up to La Cumbre Peak. Hike up to the transmission station/tower, and climb the adjacent 30' summit boulder via any number of routes from 3rd class to 5.10 (Jumpin' Jive). Soak in the views, look at the USGS marker on the top of the boulder, and pretend you are standing on a real alpine summit - because this was just a training route for that next objective anyways.    To descend - Hike eastward on E Camino Cielo for a mile or so to the big saddle. Gain the top of Tunnel Trail and begin the long hike back down to your car. Alternatively, you could retrace your steps following the trail back down the same way you came up, but you're likely tired of pulling dozens of ticks off your body by this point and will take the much better maintained and scenic Tunnel Trail option.    In total - roughly 9 miles round-trip with over 3,000' elevation gain.

Begin the climb by pulling over a steep, honeycombed block protected by the first bolt. Move through a couple of delicate face moves aided by a key pocket. After gaining the ledge, scramble up about ten feet to the next bolt. Here is where the fun really begins.     Work your way up the obvious knife blade, using both sides until you get to a small cave at the top of the major weakness. Click the bolt to your left and get ready for the crux. Power out left and pull past the overhanging crux using a key undercling in a deep dish above. Clip the next bolt and gain a crucial rest stance. Continue moving up the steep and pumpy upper face, using the arete on the left, past three more bolts to an exciting finish below the anchors shared with Unnamed 5.9.    A 70m rope will get you all the way to the base near the Live Oak tree. A 60m rope will only get you to the base of the first bolt and you'll have to scramble down 15-20 feet (not hard) to the base.

The first son of one member of the FA party was born 36 hours after the route was first led cleanly, which is how the route gets its name.   Historical note: Given that this is the natural rappel line for Unnamed 5.9, we knew this climb had likely been completed on top-rope. We recently met up with Hutch Axilrod, who first top-roped the line together with Pat Briggs, Tony Del Bechio and David Griffith III. They were developing lines on the blocks above and top-roped this line after some cleaning.

The bottom twelve feet of this rig eluded me (and others) for the better part of three years till finally, on a hot March day, I made it happen.     Jens Amundsen, a long-time Rattlesnake compatriot, was belaying. I had planned to TR the route clean before putting in a lead bolt to protect the bottom crux, but my gut had other plans. I think I needed the motivation of leading to try harder, so Jens watched patiently while I added a fat lead bolt, lowered down, and psyched up. On my second ground-up go, I climbed through the crux and reached the flared cracka new highpoint for me at the timeand then promptly fell off in surprise. Third go wasn't much better. Then, with my tips super raw and the afternoon sun about to bake the tiny crimps, I gave it my best harumph.     Done! ","{105942303: 3, 200282186: 3, 108791455: 3}"

The crux comes low, and the last 15 meters pack consistent and engaging 5.9 climbing. Enjoy!    Historical issues:    It should be noted that this part of the Renaissance Crag shows signs of past climbing attention. I found an extremely sketchy 1/4"" thick bolt that was drilled only 1/4"" in to the sandstone patina. It took about 2 or 3 turns with my fingers to remove it. I have no idea when or by whom this bolt was placed. I've asked around (Dave Griffith and Steve Edwards, for example), and no one seems to know. What's more, I've no idea what line of travel that ill-fated bolt professed to protect. In any case, I'm not the only one who thought this area worth climbing.    Also, to the left of the second bolt of this route, you can see a Metolius hanger protecting a bottomed-out seam. Again, someone has been here before me.
