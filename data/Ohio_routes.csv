Cracking Point,118826187,Trad,113224848,5.6,25,1,3.0,1.0,This route goes up the center of the face right in between Lost Soles and Chain Mail Hula Skirt.  It's a great line but the gear placements can be tricky for shorter people.  Some easy face climbing brings you into a large indent in the wall where you can compose on decent hands and feet before continuing to the harder part of the route.  Exit the indent out to the right and pull your way up into the vertical crack where Lost Soles and Chain Mail Hula Skirt intersect to get to the anchors.  If you exit the indent to the left you will just end up traversing into the start/middle of Lost Soles which is considered to be off route.  The crux of this route involves a left hand pinch/sidepull that you grab shortly after exiting the indent out right.  From this handhold you throw for the crack with your right hand and then finish on easier terrain.  The safest way to do the route is to blindly place gear in the crack above you before pulling the crux moves which is why I mention that it may be difficult for shorter people because if you cant reach the crack from below the crux you will have to pull some decently hard moves without any gear in.  It sounds like blind placements would be sketchy but the crack above the crux is so perfect for .75 cams that you can confidently place them without looking.  I will say it might be worth taking a look at it on toprope before going for the lead just to be on the safe side.,{200699514: 3}

Be very careful not to mess with any of the loose rock above the cave to the left!  I would recommend avoiding even going far enough left that you are standing under the loose rock (the red line in the picture goes further left than is needed).  The climb can be started as soon as your hands can reach the crack.

Check the photos and their descriptions for more information.  Also I just wanted to add that if you don't want to do the full topout, you can just climb until you get both hands either on or above the horizontal crack that goes across the entire boulder about a foot above the right hand side pull that you use during the crux of the climb.  At this point you have done all of the parts of the climb that give it the grade and can still drop off very safely.  There is a picture that highlights the more useful holds for the topout  and in the picture anything circled (except for the lowest circle, which is really a two finger pocket)  would work as a finish hold for a safe dropoff.",{200699514: 3}

Most people will probably climb this boulder different than I did but that's the beta I used.  There is a large hold in the crack just left of the first sloper in the problem  that looks awfully incising to try to throw to but I found getting out to it is harder than the route was intended to be and takes you pretty far off route to the left.","{200706343: 4, 200699514: 3, 200749938: 3}"
