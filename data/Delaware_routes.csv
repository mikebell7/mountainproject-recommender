(warm up traverse),107483026,Boulder,106923052,V0+,0,1,2.3,3,"The natural warmup boulder traverse a foot above ground level, on the vertical face between Arena Arete and Chossy's Corner. It's on par with, or a hair harder than, Arena Arete. Move delicately between little flakes at various heights and angles, a good drill for face climbing.","{200462758: 3, 106853948: 2, 200485073: 2}"

Do a lot of twisting and turning and squeezing to follow the steep rail to the top. Good holds, but harder than it looks.","{112529638: 3, 200626791: 3, 112825759: 2, 110233256: 2}"

Move out left for a couple moves, then back right for a tricky mantle over the lip to top out.

Movin' to CDH,118069468,Boulder,116547394,V3-4,18,1,4.0,1,"The start is only PG-13 if you don't have a spotter and the difficulty is above your pay grade. The start is on the overhanging blocky backside of the spacklehead boulder facing the river. Start with a juggy looking but just ok undercling for a left hand and a juggy full right hand pocket. Use a couple burly moves to go out left and eventually reach the crack that begins in the upper left of the alcove. Follow this crack and easy climbing to the top of the boulder. For a spicy R-rated finish (still easy though), once you turn the corner left onto the face, follow good holds up the arete until it slopes out then trend left for the last couple feet.",{112529638: 4}
Positive Contact,116547493,Boulder,116547394,V2+,8,1,2.0,1,"Start on the right side arete of the backside overhanging face of the spacklehead boulder. Follow the arete to the top trending slightly right to finish, and top out.",{112529638: 2}

Move up and slightly right on the face using small crimps and edges, top out. Stay on the face, right arete is off. No harder than V3 with good beta. Consider giving the crimps a brush, it makes a difference.","{112529638: 3, 112825759: 3, 200626791: 2}"

Hostage,116662658,Boulder,115342201,V3,16,1,3.5,2,"Start hanging on the obvious jug about 6ft. off the ground with feet on a good wide edge underneath. Deadpoint up. Reach up for a juggy side-pull and adjust feet to catch a good rest if you need it. Play with feet and balance to be able to reach up into the horizontal crack. The crux is moving off of this insecure hold to gain the slopey but high-friction top lip of the climb.  This was sandbagged hard on the old Rockclimbing.com at a V2. There is definitely some serious headgame as the crux is 13 feet up on very insecure hands, but it is no easier than V3. Good landing, but I would want at least 2 pads and a spotter. Its a long way down if that crimp blows.","{112529638: 4, 110233256: 3}"
Lithe Wire,118034973,Boulder,115342201,V2-,12,1,2.0,1,Start with smeary feet and lay back tension on right facing corner (block underneath and to the right are off). Follow corner up to a good edge and then get high feet to step up to a steep rail. Top out.,{112529638: 2}
Over the Hump day,119869134,Boulder,115342201,V4,10,1,2.0,1,Start with right hand undercling and left on the lip. Use heel hook and follow slopers up to sharp right hold around the corner to gain the arete to an easier top out.,{110233256: 2}
Ransom,116662687,Boulder,115342201,V0,11,1,2.0,1,"Start all the way back underneath the left arete of ""Hostage"" [V3] with hands underclung on the left arete and feet on the boulder to the left of hostage. Bump hands along the edge and keep tension through the feet to work your way out from under the overhang. Once out from under you can use a layback approach or sink really good kneebars in between the boulders to work your hands farther up the arete. Top out on top of the boulder to the left of ""Hostage"".  Super fun climb, and high quality for the grade. At the very least the feet will likely always need brushing as the space between the two boulders forms a natural runoff gulley. ",{112529638: 2}

Rib Cage,118940517,Boulder,118940453,V0-1,8,2,2.0,1,"The crux is the middle of the face, the crack gets pretty shallow.  Other than that the rock has a great texture and the cracks are decent size.  Good for learning to smear or warmup for bigger climbs.",{200769141: 2}
