"""It's Always Sunny In Newton County""",114328795,Sport,114328742,5.12a,80,1,3.0,1.0,"Disclaimer: This is a rather adventurous and somewhat runout (though still safe) sport route. Unorthodox to most climbing in the state, it will involve an array of skills to even obtain the belay stance to begin. For those in need of a semi-alpine experience in the ozarks, this may be up your alley. Otherwise I'd wait till more accessible routes get bolted at Dismal Hollow before travelling here.   As of now this route is missing the first pitch to link into the headwall (soon there shall be a lower pitch to reach the belay ledge, probably going to be around 12c-13a for P1)  Access:In order to access this route currently, you'll need to locate the anchors. Two ropes shall be needed as one will be used to rappel off a tree from the top and get on the top anchors, then you shall have to figure a system that works best for you to get to the low set of anchors. (part of the adventure)  The Route: The route itself is actually quite enjoyable and extremely exposed for Arkansas. The first 30ft or so involve interesting movement on interesting/precarious stone, eventually you'll reach the midway ""bivy"" ledge where you can take a breath, examine the run out (sorry; opportunity for worthwhile bolt placements around here were marginal at best). You'll also have time to think about the poor life decisions that led you to climb this route. After the ledge the climbing really begins, as you push into the steep frontier, where the rock becomes rather immaculate. Some tough moves will lead you into a stressful mantle, where some easy pulls await below the anchor. Top out the wall for full glory points and take in the view   Summary: In all this route probably shouldn't exist, but if you like bad ideas and elevated heart rates, crux moves with lots of exposure, and an overall ""Southern Alpine"" experience, it may be up your alley. If anyone happens to actually climb this, I'd love to hear about how delightful, or vice versa your outing was.  Be safe out there,  -The Alpine Cowboy",{107878550: 3}

It could also easily be done as a single pitch with a couple of longish runners (which would make it the longest pitch at HCR). I will describe the two pitch variation here.  P1. 50 feet -- 5 bolts (5.8) This pitch has a crux low and one higher up that are quite different. One comes on a mostly easy slabby section (where for at least shorter climbers) the holds seem to vanish for a move. Work right and smear or high step your way through. Casual terrain then leads to a short overhanging diheadral which turns out to be easier than it initially looks. Arrive soon after at the great midway anchor ledge. P2. 45 feet-- 4 bolts (5.9-). The second pitch is generally pretty easy climbing, but a short much steeper section of orange rock off to the left, which is not currently bolted as well as the rest of the route (possibly to prevent rope drag on a single pitch variant), clocks in harder and more bouldery. Another section of only slightly less steep 5.8 grayish rock above follows but is better protected. Then easy to the top after the previous multicolored/combined sort of headwall feature is climbed. Guidebook rates this 2nd pitch 5.8 as well, but the consensus from the Ranch staff seemed to be 5.9.

Nothing matters in life, but I'd argue if anything in the universe matters, it is this route.  So if you're lost in the sauce, searching for meaning in life, down on your luck, or just looking to have some fun?  Give this route a shot and I guarantee you'll find what you are looking for.  But for real, this climb is super cool.  Not many places offer the rare opportunity to climb a double digit boulder into a sport route.  So if you're bouldering V10, you can probably send 10b, which means that even if you have no stamina and no endurance you can still probably do this climb and tick a ""hArD sPoRt RoUtE"" for your troubles.  Climb Kneeling with a harness and draws if you're a real boy like Pinocchio.  Speaking of, if you're looking for a part of your body to grow as a result of a climb this is the route for you.  If you send Kneeling and don't do this extension, you're missing out. To those people, and very specifically my friend who didn't do the linkup:  too bad you'll never be rad.",{200216014: 4}

The obvious blank green face is practically hold-less, but my eyes traced the most possible looking line; up the previously climbed arete, and into the seams cracking the face.  Jim Karpowitz climbed this in the 80's with no fixed gear, and no pre-inspection.    This is the spirit in which 90% of the routes at Sams have since been sent.  Last year, a rash of rap and retro bolters descended on the Throne spraying bolts, and opinions on anything within gunshot.     I knew it was a matter of time before they got to the green face. It's the most obvious remaining gem. Luckily, they left it untouched. I  headed up with a small rack and figured out the ""creative"" gear placements; worked the crux, and came back two weeks later for the send.     This is how ""the game"" works at Sams, and hopefully will for a long time. Time moves slower here, and someday, someone will do the direct green face.

The conceit is that the misbehavior is due to an imp (a small demon) leading an otherwise decent person into mischief.      My Imp told me to climb this route, and much to my partners disappointment I did so.     I had read about the Imp from an Edgar Allen Poe short story, and thought about our perverse, imp-encouraged thoughts- like the common daydreams of unbuckling your harness and leaping from a ledge, driving the wrong way on the highway, or taking the corporate job with the better paycheck, but no passion.     Stepping up to this climb felt much like that.      It begins in a musty cave, deep in the belly of the Heromaker wall. Start on a pile of rocks to keep yourself from being ankle deep in the running spring water emerging from the ground.    Stepping off the ground puts you instantly into a boulder problem stemming around the moss and lichen. Eventually you can plug in a finger size cam and your belayer can relax. A couple desperate moves lead you through the shallow dihedral as the angle steepens. Your belayers stress levels will once again heighten until you get the elusive gear in the seam above.     Rest up, chalk up, and flick the Imp from your shoulder, as now the climbing gets ""fun"", or something like it.  Some struggling and thrashing gets you into the ceiling. The random hand hold on the sides of the crack will ensure you don't have to jam the Lynn Hill sized finger crack.      Now it's time to get physical! The ceiling is twenty feet off the deck, but as you grunt towards the exit, the ground comes up and the lip turns down. As you karate kick into the finish, you all of the sudden may feel like you are ""crack bouldering"". The ground is suddenly 12 feet below you!    Here the crack turns to fists, and eventually offwidth as you turn the lip.  Above, the crack turns to 5.8 junk stemming around leaves and moss. Sounds fun huh?

The pungent waft of pine needles mixed with moist soil and lichen crusted rock. The sun and wind collide to create a warm breeze that makes old men nostalgic and young men flex their muscles. It's Autumn in the Boston Mountains, and you are shouldering your pack, filled with shiny toys crafted with the intent of empowering your adventures.     If you have a shred of honesty in your bones, you know this is the best thing you have ever experienced, and tomorrow will be even better. Leaves crunch under your feet like bubble wrap, and float through the air at the encouragement of the ever present breezes. A gust sends them shooting skyward and the sky fills with the colors of decaying perfection.    Your grin and far off stare declare your November Daze.    I emerge from my daze and start heading upwards from the cave on the east side of the Throne Proper. My belayer in a daze himself, nodding and grinning to some inner nymph orchestrated music; the dogs prostrate, playing dead in a heap of twigs and maple leaves.    Campus moves initiate the adventure, escaping terra firma with feet dangling like a child from monkey bars. Not far from the truth. ""What the heck do I rate that?"" I ask Jesse. 5.7 or 5.11?

After getting established on the face, pro can be had and a breath of composure. The next moves are fun, and moderate, leading up towards the steep face above. Gear is specific and not many options present themselves. Take your time and find it, because every placement counts. Don't worry, it's bomber.    A few moves to the right avoids the absolute blankness, then back left into the line again,  finding a hidden horizontal slot for a 1/2 inch cam. From this rail, a long moves leads to a pocket and a lone bolt. Clip this and encounter the crux moves above, then top out in a November Daze, surrounded by a swirling hillside of oranges, reds and yellows, with blue tipped hills fading in the background, beckoning you to come and find what they have to offer.

The route is shaded by the trees and doesn't receive much sunshine in the later parts of the day so bring a jacket for belay or you will be cold. The technical crux of the route is the end of the first pitch where you can either make a 5.9 move over a bugle with poor gear or go the right of the bugle and do an easy chimney. The real crux of the route however is the amount of shifting large rocks. It is important that you choose your gear well to avoid ripping out a 100 lb shelf onto the belay. HELMET is required!!    Pitch 1: Start at the corner and there will be some opportunities for some larger placements until you get about 20 feet up. Then they're are some decent placements for nuts in somewhat good rock. about 50 feet up you will find a nice shelf where you can set up an anchor. The shelf is right before the obvious chimney that tops out. You will see a large rusted bolt, (not an anchor bolt, but a hardware store bolt) hammered into a horizontal crack. This is the best place to make your anchor. 5.7-5.8   The anchor at the end of pitch 1. Notice the rusted 8 inch long hardware store bolt hammered into the crack    Pitch 2: Move left of the anchor and place a #1 metolius TCU in a crack between a large boulder and the chimney walls. Sling that and keep moving left. Start moving up when you hit the chimney wall opposing the anchor. Once there it is a jug haul in a really cool 3.5 feet wide chimney with solid gear. You can place as much gear as you want to in both sides of the wall. After about 35 feet, you will come to a bomber horizontal crack that will take #2 to #.4 BD cams. Build an anchor here and horn the rock just above the 3 foot horizontal crack. your partner will top out from the other side of the chimney. 5.6",{108613080: 3}
