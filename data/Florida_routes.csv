Watch out for Spiders,118706486,Boulder,118706406,V3,500,1,2.0,1,"Endurance, endurance, endurance. Panels vary and depending on figure size you may want to tape your cuticles. It's long but moves are no harder than a V3. Some panels have dirt, plants and/or spiders in the cracks. Bring a rag or broom as your weapon. ",{200490768: 2}
Gator,116096721,Boulder,108970421,V4+,20,1,4.0,1,"Sit start matched in the south west side of the cave formation. Begin by traversing east, finding the lowest possible ledges for hands. You will most certainly need to sprinkle a few heel hooks in there along with some spicy footwork. As you get to the exit of the cave set your feet high and work your way up over the northeast face. The rock gets sharp and brittle here so watch how you distribute your weight. Head straight up a few moves and top out. A clean pumpy line that involves a bit of finess. Climb with a mustache to reduce the rating by one full grade.   Easier variation by using upper handholds before you pull the east bulge. Don’t be a wuss, Harden up and get it done.  ",{200387297: 4}
Love Shack,116382391,Boulder,108970421,V4+,20,1,3.5,2,"Another proper line in this area. Start matched on the north side of the cave formation under a roof with an opening in it. There is a smooth ledge for hands and feet, traverse south from beneath the roof, and setup for a long reach out to the head wall. If you catch the hold, match hands and set feet up to pull straight up over the bulge. Top out. This route is as fun as it sounds, and at times it can be wet, sandy, and has a sharp top out. Good.","{200387297: 4, 200613389: 3}"
Unknown Hueco Route,114000389,Boulder,108970421,V0,10,1,3.3,3,"Start below hueco and climb up using.

Don't be afraid to use the chipped corner up and to your left! Do one or two short moves to get a hand up atop the structure then mantle to top out. It is MANDATORY that you then stand atop the structure and perform the traditional University of Florida ""gator chomp"" arm motion.","{200227191: 3, 200206280: 1, 200555411: 1}"
