Instead of stopping where the chalk ends, climb past anchor onto a friable slab and take it to a different anchor at a great ledge. 5.12a    Pitch 2: 14 bolts. The crux.  Step left on the ledge and make thin, but generally easy moves up the slab above.

P2 - climb up and left over a small pinnacle and step down left to a nice ledge (this is a little funky but straight-forward and not hard).    P3 - get your head on and move up, passing on the left side of a huge hollow-sounding flake and into the overhanging section, move right past this (5.9) to belay on a small ledge.    P4 - jam up right in the clean, solid crack for the money pitch of the route (5.8), then follow the chimney to a big ledge.

Free Picnic Lunch Wall,106824064.0,Trad,105789050.0,5.12d,550.0,5.0,3.5,2.0,"Oregon's first big wall now offers great free-climbing to the top of Smith Rock's most intimidating wall. Expect a first rate soft-rock adventure that delivers 5 distinct pitches of mostly solid rock and protection. Hard cranking, mega-exposure, and surprisingly classic climbing will be encountered while scaling this Cathedral of mud. The ability to confidently climb on questionable rock over questionable gear is a pre-requisite.     Pitch 1: Polishing The Turd: The crux comes 12ft off the ground with an arguably un-protectable boulder problem that cranks a poor finger lock while surmounting an awkward roof (V4). Continue up banged-out peg scars that offer some pretty fun, and pumpy sport-type climbing and reasonably decent gear. Flow past a few bolts (redpoint crux) and then enter the ugly. A section of dirty, shattered rock, with a sweet guano fist jam through the worst rock encounteted on the whole wall. It was cleaned extensively, but how long do you spend polishing a turd? Skip the rap-hangers to the left of the crack, and above the rock and climbing improve considerably for the pitches' ending. Clip one historic pin (an angle, leave it for nostalgia!!!) and end at the great belay stance with updated, bomber anchors. 135' 5.12    Note: freed mid 1980's by Bob McGown the morning after a rageing wedding party. Alan Watts hid and watched from a distance to validate the ascent! 12a has crept to about 12c from repeated nailing- no more nailing!    Pitch 2: The Muddy Traverse: head straight right across the obvious shelf, clipping a couple of updated bolts, and then carefully placing cams that I would be nervous about hanging a hat on in the peg scars in the roof's underclings. Thankfully its only 5.7 here. When the foot shelf disappears and the exposure heightens, updated bolts appear for the clipping. The pitch culminates with the amazingly exposed ""Lose Your Lunch"" boulder problem that cranks the air fantastic with 200ft of massive overhangs tugging you toward the Crooked River below. Strange how its not too far off the ground here, but the unique geometry of the wall is such that it doesn't get much more exposed than this! Commiting, explosive and nauseating- unforgettable! (v5/6) Pass a couple more updated aidin' bolts to another sweet b-lay stance. 85ft traverse 5.12d    Pitch 3: The Clean Corner: Looking at this section of rock from the ground below, I would have sworn this was going to be a vision quest pitch-au contraire! Nice creamy stone (like on Monkey Face), plenty of bolts and a bit of gear see you through a great pitch of fingerlocks,  stemming, and arête grabbing. Crux comes at the end with taxing stems in a precarious position. Carefully place gear here and avoid the ledge fall. Another ending at a sweet little belay stance with rap hangers. 70' 5.12    Pitch 4: The Airy Vari. to the High Tech Corner: On this pitch, the corner immediately above the belay was mostly an aid bolt ladder, and the pin scars that did exist were worthless powder, so I did what any free climber would do: I found a variation :) Climb right from the belay onto the purple/red face with some cryptic and delicate climbing on cool features that protects with 4 added bolts and don't affect the original aid line in any way. Rejoin the corner about 30 feet higher. The corner is clean, hard stone, with cerebral stemming, technical footwork, and cranker 1 finger locks in pin scars. A couple of beautifully updated bomber bolts are your buddies here, but the crux is still protected with natural gear that has to be placed when the heat is turned way up high. Don't expect a picnic. Power and finesse your way up to the 4 foot roof above, pull the roof into the above corner (redpoint crux)and then traverse right on some beautiful red stone to a semi... well, mostly hanging belay with ASCA hangers (updated in 2007 by Jim Anglin, Cody Peterson and ?). The belay was likely placed here under a little overlap to protect the belayer from any potential falling rock, and still allow visual contact with the leader for the final pitch. 75' 5.12d    Pitch 5: The Dead End Corner to the The Mud Butt Traverse: Decipher a section of 5.11 past a couple of updated bolts, and then reach a surprisingly clean crack in the right-facing corner that protects well and clocks in at about 5.10d. Natural gear for 60 feet or so, and then right when the rock starts to turn evil, its time to get off this wall- traverse right for 25' on a very technical and delicate muddy face of knobs and crimps- a casually exposed 500 feet off the ground. Don't shit your pants! Four 1/2"" by 8"" bomber glue-in bolts have replaced their ancestors on this traverse. Sneak around the corner to a belay in the trough. 100' 5.12a- You just climbed the Picnic Lunch Wall!     This wall was equipped for free climbing by myself, with help and hardware donations from Ryan Lawson and bolt hanger donations from Metolius. No bolts were added to the aid line. 21 bolts were replaced, many un-needed junk bolts were removed, and the anchors have all been updated. This wall should never again be nailed. Go free, go clean, or go home:)","{111785035: 4, 106058125: 3}"

Enjoy this thought provoking technical slab dancing up and around a distinct column feature that hangs down the route. Work into another shallower corner above the large column then onto jug flakes.

Undercling the fang and move left to a good sloper.  Mantle the subtle ledge, then up to killer knobs under the shallow roof.  Moving past this roof & the third bolt is the crux.  A pair of good edges up & left lead to a vertical slot in a shallow seam, and a few more tenous moves to get established above the roof.      Once above the roof, continue up rounded flakes & quintessential Smith knobs, past a few large pockets towards the top of the wall.  The rock deteriorates substantially near the top.

Begin with easy moves up big, incut flakes, and continue with easy stemming.  The difficulty increases with height, as the stems become more awkward and the footholds less secure.  After clipping a fixed angle, an awkward rest is possible in the shallow corner.  The crux hits as the angle kicks back and the offset switches from left-facing to right-facing.

All Hell Breaks Loose,117324204.0,Trad,109149631.0,5.7,0.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,"7/8/2020 Edit: After receiving feedback from A. Watts and his consultation of other climbers it seems as though the route we took was not, in fact, the East Chimney. According to these other individuals it seems the line we took doesn't have a recorded history or ascent. As such, I've renamed the route to the suggested route name in my original write up below.   From the onset of leaving the ground the rock begins to crumble around you; eventually it was just assumed the barrage of rock would be constant so I stopped announcing every time one cut loose. If you bring a pack, hang it from your harness and begin making upward progress. Pitch 1 is the straightforward chimney; tread lightly and don't let your head get the best of you. There's not much for solid pro so place what you feel might work and move along. In about ~75-80ft, belay from the wide ledge. From here, Pitch 2 begins which is also where the first of the two cruxes start. With no protection save for the anchor, step across and pull up into comparatively better terrain and place a few small pieces. If you don't blow that, congratulations, you're alive and through the first crux. Take a breather and enjoy the view; not many have. From here, work your way back climbers left traversing delicately back to the chimney. Continue up through a bulging, squeeze chimney mixed with surprisingly better rock. (I placed a good #4 up high). You'll top out of Pitch 2 on a ramp covered in scree. From here, a short, ill-protected traverse over to a spire with a rappel will lead you down to the west gully. It should go without saying that this climb is a memorable experience and provides for a unique perspective of the park. A positive mental attitude coupled with a clear head will do better than any physical protection which was limited and suspect at best, a fall anywhere on Pitch 2 would result in a trip to the hospital at best. ***To anyone else who has climbed this we would welcome the opportunity to sit down and share our experience. **My submission for possible secondary/accompanying names for the route, ""All Hell Breaks Loose'.

The first crux is an amazing, desperate, dynamic problem from a good undercling to a nasty two finger pocket (clip in the meantime), then a powerful pull from the pocket to another two finger pocket gaston.  Once you have the second pocket, move your feet up, maybe gaston with your right hand, and get set for the exhilarating throw to a big flat jug.      The moves flow more amicably from here until you hit a second crux: reach out left, finger-lock in a small, sharp (foot)hold, step high with your right, and snag the sloper.  I consider this the second of three cruxes, but maybe others don't share that opinion.    For the final crux, establish on the powerful underclings, boldly trust the feet, and stab high, with your right hand, into a positive two-finger pocket.  There is shitty sloper-crimp-thumb-catch that works for an intermediate, but I wouldn't expect much. While significantly more powerful than the first crux, it doesn't require a dyno, so it is higher probability for me.    From the pocket, dance up through a delightful series of huge pockets, with long reaches in between.  This gives those big muscle groups a workout, and lets the fingers rest a little.     Expect 5.11 climbing for a couple of bolts, and then a couple bolts worth of medium/hard 5.12 before you make it to a rail that leads to the anchor. These moves are actually quite technical and sequential.  The toughest moves involve locking off on a right hand pocket (awkward for me), grabbing a crappy left hand duo, and working the feet up high to double drop knees.  Bear down on the beloved triangle hold with the left hand, and then shimmy yourself over to the right to grab a good hold.  You'll have to lock this thing off to your hip, so get your feet high, and stab your left hand into a tight two finger pocket that feels miles away.  It's hard to say, because I'm wrecked by that point, but the headwall could be 12d.      As hard as each of the problems is, the hardest thing is that there aren't any rests until you hit the big pockets at sixty feet.  At that point, you still have thirty feet to go.

Start the Burl Master by summiting a two foot pile of cheater stones.  Reach up to some good holds on the roof, cut your feet, and launch in to a short dynamic boulder problem.  Top out this rather pointless boulder problem and get a full recovery before you enter the meat of the route.    Traverse left to the fifth bolt and execute a controlled dyno to a big slopey jug.  Clip the sixth bolt and battle upward past a bad crimp with the aid of a mono intermediate.  Try to shake out at the seventh bolt before embarking on a technical leftward traverse.    After the final draw is clipped you are basically just making your way up the wall on a series of good horizontal holds.  One last left hand dynamic (crux) move gets you to a good jug and the route is in the bag at that point.

Working this route you get to repeatedly do the lower Aggro Monkey crux which results in finally learning the correct beta and actual enjoyment of the lower roof.     From there, you get a great rest and then up and right for about 20 feet of really fun climbing (11 plus/12a) with ending with a really fun big move off a left gaston to latch the ""basketball"" hold with your right.  The ""basketball"" has a great curved lip for both hands and you clip here and try to get a quick shake before the crux.    The crux is grabbing poor left hand, setting feet on two bad holds and dyno for a big four finger pocket that is very soft, but hard to hold. If you latch the hold, do the ""jump on your kitchen counter top move"" to get your left foot on basketball, then balance up and match on a really slipperly sloper.  You are standing on a huge foothold so just hold on very gently and gingerly bring right up to good foot and quick pop to good holds.  Clip and very fun big moves/big holds to anchor.

Belay from some large boulders at the base of the route.","{106477440: 4, 10116: 4, 105789175: 4, 107153125: 4, 105809872: 4, 107305609: 4, 106870964: 4, 107599599: 4, 105878024: 4, 107242092: 4, 10368: 4, 106026309: 4, 105960937: 4, 107135785: 4, 10143: 4, 107616008: 4, 106241194: 4, 107992165: 4, 106946154: 4, 106278755: 4, 107827482: 4, 106047496: 4, 105883302: 4, 106404256: 4, 106559069: 4, 106609976: 4, 106389004: 4, 15142: 4, 106712274: 4, 106819490: 4, 106892871: 4, 106486749: 4, 107146981: 4, 106006184: 4, 106285308: 4, 107183802: 4, 106874601: 4, 106456961: 4, 107450229: 4, 106484179: 4, 106253591: 4, 107224861: 4, 108066294: 4, 108777264: 4, 106601971: 4, 108195060: 4, 108145511: 4, 108552057: 4, 106761693: 4, 109559136: 4, 109104070: 4, 108279952: 4, 106200072: 4, 108118527: 4, 107207085: 4, 107254354: 4, 108755823: 4, 107616773: 4, 109028532: 4, 106109031: 4, 107737478: 4, 106860947: 4, 108975346: 4, 106610639: 4, 111235518: 4, 106913599: 4, 106422719: 4, 110915682: 4, 108358146: 4, 108984178: 4, 109037301: 4, 108267789: 4, 109313896: 4, 108412656: 4, 110206802: 4, 111373936: 4, 110718577: 4, 107776727: 4, 106378922: 4, 111781359: 4, 106569451: 4, 111992334: 4, 110294685: 4, 108690071: 4, 106822061: 4, 106517269: 4, 106961386: 4, 111833511: 4, 108550778: 4, 110240029: 4, 109402210: 4, 111351745: 4, 112323726: 4, 110847522: 4, 110585520: 4, 107682818: 4, 108392797: 4, 106545618: 4, 110752881: 4, 111024305: 4, 11509: 4, 111624139: 4, 110937405: 4, 108061795: 4, 109258388: 4, 111240179: 4, 109913395: 4, 112250778: 4, 106839278: 4, 108383947: 4, 111747638: 4, 108416975: 4, 112060545: 4, 112370129: 4, 108243264: 4, 110961681: 4, 107395651: 4, 200153220: 4, 110098525: 4, 108091672: 4, 111812949: 4, 108698249: 4, 111697855: 4, 111742479: 4, 111948265: 4, 200031206: 4, 109638995: 4, 111465523: 4, 108782961: 4, 108243919: 4, 111114085: 4, 111752519: 4, 112023123: 4, 112010398: 4, 200272035: 4, 200296165: 4, 200199939: 4, 109474377: 4, 108230515: 4, 200211308: 4, 111097102: 4, 109463002: 4, 108647959: 4, 200219560: 4, 200202843: 4, 200076183: 4, 111718218: 4, 108226990: 4, 200235611: 4, 200223188: 4, 113478649: 4, 112406421: 4, 111124163: 4, 107734618: 4, 107184020: 4, 200273632: 4, 200063188: 4, 110152429: 4, 110298630: 4, 200455675: 4, 112086258: 4, 200478778: 4, 108751329: 4, 200439103: 4, 200089760: 4, 107545559: 4, 200587713: 4, 200248105: 4, 200208997: 4, 200299394: 4, 200033634: 4, 108163249: 4, 110148614: 4, 200246972: 4, 105986261: 4, 111149410: 4, 200173852: 4, 111977319: 4, 200199038: 4, 112139698: 4, 112002996: 4, 105935712: 4, 200594520: 4, 200200801: 4, 107016978: 4, 111658578: 4, 200263526: 4, 200762782: 4, 200216421: 4, 200186318: 4, 200744047: 4, 200246689: 4, 200852549: 4, 200587997: 4, 109138328: 4, 105873502: 3, 105805707: 3, 106156272: 3, 105851688: 3, 10168: 3, 106494476: 3, 105982463: 3, 105973110: 3, 106389541: 3, 106046804: 3, 106497287: 3, 106347294: 3, 105844582: 3, 105825953: 3, 106440579: 3, 106024234: 3, 106874073: 3, 106961127: 3, 107032345: 3, 106380853: 3, 107062221: 3, 107698604: 3, 107618213: 3, 108188495: 3, 106102123: 3, 106780021: 3, 108266997: 3, 107449977: 3, 106126874: 3, 108222719: 3, 107292120: 3, 107160134: 3, 107043617: 3, 107946583: 3, 110011366: 3, 110339904: 3, 108074697: 3, 107574884: 3, 106910356: 3, 109693919: 3, 107990106: 3, 107561968: 3, 110967113: 3, 107000115: 3, 109392078: 3, 111889849: 3, 108282289: 3, 108234518: 3, 109316126: 3, 106489329: 3, 111794035: 3, 200053620: 3, 108726865: 3, 109159474: 3, 107647261: 3, 111700144: 3, 200184538: 3, 107847782: 3, 106973304: 3, 110547057: 3, 10544: 3, 200168169: 3, 112468948: 3, 200216441: 3, 200072833: 3, 105952525: 3, 200398350: 3, 108305598: 3, 111801079: 3, 106323170: 3, 200528462: 3, 110524813: 3, 111190382: 3, 107603653: 3, 200391175: 3, 106049062: 3, 107696894: 3, 106308715: 3, 200491318: 3, 110873869: 3, 112413521: 3, 200212139: 3, 108557813: 3, 110744057: 3, 106752313: 3, 107152512: 3, 108031645: 2, 106859002: 2, 111114330: 2, 106449525: 2, 109101477: 2, 112006024: 2}"

Move quickly through this section or you will get very pumped due to the overhanging nature of the climb.  For the beginning section if you find yourself making a move off of anything that is worse than a perfect sinker two finger pocket you have probably biffed the sequence.  At the sixth bolt position yourself to do the ""frizmo,"" (whatever that is) or maybe just move dynamically to a big jug?  The route is roughly 12c to that point.    Rest at the big jug before you launch in to a bewildering array of slab and bulge moves.  The finish of this route climbs more like a route from the gorge rather than the tuff.  The hardest moves travel through technical sidepulls between the 8th and 9th bolt.  You'll be rewarded with a jug rest at the 9th bolt.  The rest of the moves are not trivial so shake out before you try to decipher the next bulge.  Several sequences can get you through this section, but anyway you move you'll end up using a 1.5 pad mono.  The moves remain tricky all the way to the chains.  The slab is very unique and anything but tedious.  Take the time to work the moves on the slab and you will be rewarded.    This is a great route to do if you like good movement and solitude.

The fun and consistent 5.8 climbing is straightforward and enjoyable as a warmup or a toprope.  A Smith classic!    This is the left-most route on the big huecoed section of the wall.  There's one bolt that can't be seen from the ground (it's in one of the big huecos), so remember to bring a 'draw for it.    Due to its central location and easy grade this is possibly the most popular route at Smith Rock.  There is almost always a rope up on it and a crowd of people at the base.  It receives early morning sun and keeps it all day, making it a good starting point for the cold days.","{107503482: 4, 106834150: 4, 106560817: 4, 10116: 4, 105787493: 4, 105789175: 4, 107083009: 4,

This is probably the most worked route at Smith and many people have it so wired they can spew beta and call out sequences without even looking at the person climbing it.    It's for good reason though, since it really is a classic route here.  It starts on fantastic deep pockets and gets progressively harder, finishing with a crux traverse sequence at the last bolt.  Whether you climb it as a warmup for harder routes or work it as a project it's absolutely worth doing if you can climb the grade.  Due to the amount of help you'll get (whether you want it or not...) and the quality of the moves this would be a great first Smith .13a.","{112400297: 4, 108018674: 4, 106200072: 4, 111697855: 4, 108726865: 4, 106456961: 4, 108226990: 4, 108429138: 4, 112250530: 4, 110262540: 4, 108684526: 4, 200404222: 4, 112002240: 4, 108552057: 4, 110752881: 4, 106822061: 4, 200446052: 4, 107920516: 4, 200212139: 4, 111235518: 4, 107545559: 4, 200058035: 4, 107990106: 4, 10143: 4, 106961127: 4, 106285308: 4, 107127714: 4, 105887231: 4, 105850826: 4, 105789175: 4, 10116: 4, 107193269: 4, 107450229: 4, 106870964: 4, 11509: 4, 111101320: 4, 106006184: 4, 108358146: 4, 106912223: 4, 108248066: 4, 108543653: 4, 105878863: 3, 106859002: 3, 108416975: 3, 106389004: 3, 110807723: 3, 107292120: 3, 200480386: 3, 14152: 3, 111751445: 3, 107312131: 3, 200443617: 3, 108052663: 2, 106449525: 2}"

Good face climbing on the bottom leads to juggy huecos at the top.,"{106047496: 4, 105939248: 4, 106859002: 4, 109424881: 4, 107528726: 4, 108778861: 4, 107327535: 4, 109834877: 4, 111373936: 4, 200103621: 4, 200128575: 4, 111124163: 4, 200118368: 4, 200144733: 4, 106776142: 3, 10116: 3, 105789175: 3, 105790762: 3, 105789785: 3, 105809872: 3, 107305609: 3, 106156272: 3, 107475857: 3, 12988: 3, 106005650: 3, 105986261: 3, 106484179: 3, 106224129: 3, 105898385: 3, 105973110: 3, 106022334: 3, 105916328: 3, 105946742: 3, 106369442: 3, 106761693: 3, 106851992: 3, 10382: 3, 106422819: 3, 106389004: 3, 107529159: 3, 106006184: 3, 107874694: 3, 107870857: 3, 109049814: 3, 108552057: 3, 109607807: 3, 105981534: 3, 106398311: 3, 107616614: 3, 106601971: 3, 108418119: 3, 110268695: 3, 111091265: 3, 107469950: 3, 107737478: 3, 110585520: 3, 111448775: 3, 200044470: 3, 108730433: 3, 200134563: 3, 110225880: 3, 111465523: 3, 110669338: 3, 112495943: 3, 200148448: 3, 11509: 3, 111097102: 3, 200340779: 3, 109169153: 3, 200478778: 3, 200446052: 3, 200557578: 3, 113164188: 3, 108219613: 3, 107016978: 3, 200216421: 3, 200615379: 3, 113522523: 3, 200232403: 3, 110807723: 3, 105794408: 2, 105801073: 2, 10368: 2, 105906992: 2, 105893631: 2, 105870586: 2, 107071499: 2, 106744745: 2, 106026309: 2, 106494476: 2, 106158624: 2, 106203442: 2, 106251374: 2, 105790555: 2, 105867264: 2, 106046804: 2, 106718311: 2, 106446644: 2, 106874073: 2, 106847186: 2, 107120404: 2, 106780021: 2, 108390975: 2, 108066294: 2, 106569451: 2, 108295148: 2, 105913057: 2, 106200072: 2, 106054402: 2, 110011366: 2, 110339904: 2, 106442253: 2, 108425059: 2, 106542095: 2, 107001378: 2, 107656938: 2, 107715396: 2, 107805637: 2, 109104070: 2, 106913599: 2, 107919778: 2, 109503921: 2, 106910356: 2, 107847782: 2, 107497265: 2, 108967941: 2, 106477440: 2, 107009084: 2, 107829049: 2, 105982463: 2, 112323726: 2, 108243919: 2, 111752519: 2, 108392797: 2, 109488917: 2, 111624139: 2, 108412656: 2, 107521255: 2, 109230273: 2, 112060545: 2, 200070835: 2, 110536605: 2, 106074295: 2, 108726865: 2, 109369904: 2, 111945227: 2, 110931603: 2, 10544: 2, 200261925: 2, 108383947: 2, 111153248: 2, 200240855: 2, 107647261: 2, 108230515: 2, 108684526: 2, 108981462: 2, 107616773: 2, 106973304: 2, 107734618: 2, 106405973: 2, 108236507: 2, 107603653: 2, 112890806: 2, 108824777: 2, 110148614: 2, 200350043: 2, 111190382: 2, 200587713: 2, 200212139: 2, 111774593: 2, 14568: 2, 200415259: 2, 111787571: 2, 200594520: 2, 110729900: 2, 200526561: 2, 105792055: 1, 14015: 1, 109559136: 1, 107933029: 1, 110206802: 1, 106449525: 1, 111992286: 1, 106856071: 1, 200173328: 1}"

Step across and begin pulling on good pockets. Once you clip bolt 3 the business begins, make a long reach to great pockets, then move out to a ledge. More tenuous pockets await. At the 5th bolt the first crux begins, shallow pockets combined with a strange stem lead you to better sidepulls. Move into good stemming rest before the roof. Great holds lead you to the head wall. The next crux involves some arete pinching with a long reach. The climbing does not ease from there, as a pump crux may foil your send.     Note: most of the pockets of this route have been drilled, but what route at Smith doesn't have some manufacturing.","{105850826: 4, 108416975: 4, 108266997: 4, 107094371: 4, 107521255: 4, 108429138: 4, 106456961: 4, 106496249: 4, 200404222: 4, 200058035: 4, 200212139: 4, 112012688: 4, 111697855: 4, 110752881: 4, 107946583: 4, 111700144: 4, 105982463: 4, 112250530: 4, 106239028: 4, 111331398: 4, 10116: 4, 106494476: 4, 106219990: 4, 106389004: 4, 106006184: 4, 106285308: 4, 106961127: 4, 106870964: 4, 108358146: 4, 109928432: 4, 107990106: 4, 106008830: 4, 11509: 4, 13115: 4, 108248066: 4, 110262540: 4, 112400297: 4}"

The first pitch is fairly long and gives a good leg pump, but there are plenty of good shakes.  The moves that are in the 10c section and which the book says makes a great climb on its own are the hardest.  High-stepping is very beneficial.  That said, if you make it through to the first set of anchors you should keep going because it's not any more difficult.  However the gear sucks through the 11- section and a long fall is pretty much guaranteed if you let go...so don't. Great rock and cool moves.

At the 100 ft mark you get another large rest, followed by the redpoint crux: a butthole puckering 50 ft slab of flawless red stone. From here to the summit felt similar to climbing Watts Tots.

The second anchor comes after a section of 5.10c, and the third after an additional section of 5.9.  You can lower off the highest anchor with a 60 M line.    P1. Begin by heading up steep ground to the first bolt (some will want a stick clip-- the moves are not totally trivial), then follow the massive huecos up and left to the first set of chains (5.9).    P2. Continue heading up and left as the pockets get smaller and sparser.  The crux arises soon after leaving the first pitch anchor and involves some tricky sidepulls.  Remember to look left if you feel like you are running out of positive features on this pitch!

Each winter hardmen flock to this site in search of 'good' (read: frigid) conditions for the redpoint.  This is another great example of a route without holds.  Sure, there are holds in spots, but in the business, you're basically slapping and sloping on pitiful ripples.    The route begins a few meters right of Churning, atop a flat boulder.  Careful not to bump your head while surmounting the V0 boulder problem to reach the opening holds.  The six easiest moves on the route are those leading up to the 3rd bolt.  From here a good, but somewhat unnecessary rest gives you a chance to recoup for what is likely the most difficult bit of climbing.  A tremendous amount of finger strength, skin, and a knob that one local compared to a medieval-mace, will be required to reach the excellent jugs right of the 5th bolt.  The 4th bolt can be a bit tricky to clip if you're short.  I recommend practicing the clipping stance on TR, as a blown clip here would certainly send you to the hospital.    Shake what you can at the 5th bolt.  The next crux is downright heinous without the proper beta.  Ask a local if you prefer, or spend 3 days trading finger skin and motivation for 'a sense of accomplishment' like I did.  After clipping the 6th bolt, the climbing is relatively casual, but still very technical with big moves, ending with large jugs and a dubious rest at the Churning anchor.  Again, rest the best you can...     Traverse right to the hanging arete.  The traverse is rather technical, very pumpy, and culminates in some desparate slaps up the arete to an excellent jug at the 9th bolt.  You should plan to hang out here for a while, as it will be a mad dash to the anchor from here.      The next 30 feet are widely regarded as the actual crux of the route.  This section is doubtless the redpoint crux, but I felt the moves at the 4th bolt were much more difficult.  I won't give anything away, but it would be useful to have at least a master's degree in arete technique.  I would argue the entire upper arete, from the Churning anchor to the Fish chains is about 12d.  Its probably less powerful than Split Image (12c/d), but a bit longer and more involved technically.

The beta is very complex and the route is challenging for the grade.  The varied nature of the route gives a decided advantage to well rounded climbers.    The easiest way to start this route is to traverse in from the right side from a large boulder.  Stem on the boulder and do a couple hard bouldery cross moves to reach the first bolt.  These are likely the most strenuous moves of the route.  If you spend the time to work out the moves you'll probably stumble on a sequence that is doable and not too awkward.  Be careful executing a final lunge to a positive flake below the second bolt.  A fall here would leave you close to the ground.    Enjoy some long aesthetic reaches between incut pockets as you traverse rightward to the third bolt of Kings of Rap.  Follow a series of two and three finger pockets to a large roof.  A long sling on the 6th bolt should prove helpful.    After clipping the 7th bolt prepare for a strenuous leftward exit of the roof.  Try to shake out before the roof if possible.  The roof moves can be bewildering, involving tenuous pockets and a really challenging left high step.    Once around the roof slap and claw your way up to a really good rest at the 9th bolt.  You are now on the finishing arete of vicious fish.  The last three bolts of the arete are really intriguing.

An excellent climb with technical movement and a heartbreaker crux at the top (for those who pitch off there).

Pitch 2:  (10.b) Move straight up into the right-facing dihedral.  This pitch is traditionally thought of as the crux of the climb for both its technical moves off the belay and endurance required on this long pitch.  Belay at a ledge on the left at a bolted anchor.      Pitch 3:  (5.9)  Continue up the corner for a few feet and make an exposed traverse out onto the face to the right.(pro may be placed in a few pods here but watch rope drag on this pitch)  Keep moving up and right until you reach a roof.  Be careful on this pitch so as not to rain rocks down on the popular areas below.    Pitch 4:  (5.9)  Climb this fantasticly steep and juggy flake to the summit.  A truly spectacular pitch with fun moves and superb position.    This climb will get you on top of the main formation at smith.

Popism,107449996.0,Sport,105789067.0,5.11b/c,50.0,1.0,1.7,13.0,"  From stepping off the ground until the third bolt is reached, this brutal climb will offer little respite.  Popism feels quite hard for the grade which is probably due to having all the strenuous climbing crammed into a scant twenty-five feet of rock.  Good hands and good feet are plentiful but one will rarely have both at the same time until rounding the blunt arête.  Start on the far right edge of The Peanut.  Work the right edge of the block with your right hand.  Marginal holds will soon appear on the face.  Make a short traverse left to get to some good pockets and sidepulls which will be used heavily.  I'm not going to say Popism is some forgotten gem, it's not.  Those liking bouldery 5.11's might enjoy it though.    A top-rope can easily be set up by climbing Pop Goes the Nubbin and making a short, easy traverse down and right to the Popism anchor.","{200354897: 3, 200170248: 2, 106670517: 2, 200152964: 2, 200240855: 2, 111165448: 2, 107780599: 2, 110206802: 2, 108412656: 1, 110268695: 1, 106477440: 1, 107974182: 1, 106946154: 1}"

Pitch 1: 10.b   Start in the same corner system as Calamity Jam but climb out the right side of the bulge via a thin crack. The crack widens to hands above but stays on you for a ways. Move right to a bolted belay.    Pitch 2: 5.9   Some people break this into two pitches with a gear anchor if topping out.

But after several trips of not being able to find an open bolted route to warm up on, we brought the rack, and found this route.  It was better than expected, but not as good as Pack Animal.    I linked the pitches with a 70m rope.  What I found was a stiff first pitch (I mistakenly did the Infinity Variation, 10-, the real approach pitch of Friday's Jinx is better.) with poor rock and not great gear.  The top pitch, however, was great - a long, fairly technical dihedral.  There are actually some moves on this thing!  The gear and rock are good on the second pitch.  For someone looking to warm up for the dihedral on Zebra Zion, this pitch would be a good way to do it.      Unfortunately, the chains are too high to allow a single rappel with a 70m rope.  This made for a much less pleasant outing.  If anyone is up for placing lower anchors, it would be nice to not force the climber to ascend the last 20-40 feet of chossy crap, and allow a rappel (and slingshot belay) with a 70.","{106156272: 3, 106785541: 3, 107735421: 3, 108813207: 3, 112128100: 3, 109037301: 3, 200259204: 3, 108155086: 3, 110669338: 3, 112077494: 3, 108254193: 3, 107118298: 3, 7101227: 3, 15023: 3, 105797754: 3, 106158624: 3, 105878863: 3, 106455351: 3, 106530481: 3, 106047496: 2, 107083009: 2, 200056611: 2, 200350043: 2, 106477440: 2, 10544: 2, 111137975: 2, 112260013: 2, 107140193: 2, 107071499: 2, 110459813: 2, 107230627: 2, 111185402: 2, 106670517: 2, 110529846: 2, 106074295: 2, 106095805: 2, 108405806: 2}"

The route felt hard for the grade.","{15023: 4, 106005650: 4, 110326550: 4, 200122090: 4, 7008080: 4, 106455351: 4, 108967941: 4, 105883302: 4, 112551257: 4, 106046804: 4, 105878863: 4, 110965145: 4, 109361563: 4, 105873502: 4, 107919778: 4, 109607807: 4, 109280306: 4, 108444026: 4, 108412656: 3, 107768989: 3, 108122674: 3, 108279952: 3, 107616614: 3, 14305: 3, 107272204: 3, 106859002: 3, 109369904: 3, 106200072: 3, 107746328: 3, 110585520: 3, 107016978: 3, 200212139: 3, 106405973: 3, 108234518: 3, 200066217: 3, 106477440: 3, 110151691: 3, 106074295: 3, 10544: 3, 107603653: 3, 109037301: 3, 109638995: 3, 108230515: 3, 107734618: 3, 110752881: 3, 105789175: 3, 106569451: 3, 106134676: 3, 106047496: 3, 105898385: 3, 106008830: 3, 105964496: 3, 106076114: 3, 105906559: 3, 105801073: 3, 14568: 3, 106156272: 3, 105809872: 3, 105797754: 3, 10368: 3, 105792055: 3, 105982463: 3, 106446644: 3, 107292120: 3, 108121368: 3, 107684440: 3, 107890277: 3, 106389004: 3, 107071499: 3, 107230627: 3, 106422819: 3, 10116: 3, 107032345: 3, 14015: 3, 106136895: 2, 105973110: 2, 106670517: 2, 113164188: 2, 106158624: 2, 106399334: 2, 200594520: 2, 200455675: 2, 110529846: 2, 108266997: 2, 106006184: 2, 200259204: 2, 105870586: 2, 107083315: 2, 105888978: 2, 106601971: 2, 107575405: 1, 113522523: 1}"

Begin by scrambling up ledges immediately left of Latin Lover.  There is a bit of lose gravel on these ledges, so use caution.  A thin-hand sized piece can be used to protect these moves, but is not necessary.  From the ledge head straight up the face on cool knobs & the occasional shallow pocket.  Use care approaching the second bolt.  The crux comes below the 4th bolt, on a tenuous traverse from left to right.      Almost Nothing gets a lot of shade compared to other Dihedrals routes, making it a good morning option on a warm day.","{108305598: 4, 105878863: 3, 107054954: 3, 200212139: 3, 107603653: 3, 112012688: 3, 106589114: 3, 107132736: 3, 106712120: 3, 110262540: 3, 109700701: 3, 106049062: 3, 106495144: 2, 107016978: 2}"

Slightly overhanging the entire way, the climbing is spectacular.  Fantastic jams down low on Karate Crack lead to classic Smith face climbing up higher on nubins, pockets, and crimps.  Several semi-rests make the marathon pitch seem plausible but still pumpy and interesting.    The route begins up Karate crack.  As Karate Crack arches right, leave the crack and continue straight up the face.  After placing a large cam in a pod above the crack you'll enter the sport part of the climb.  This climb is commonly said to have two cruxes.  One down low is reachy, thin, and crimpy but short while up higher you'll go through a sequential endurance sequence.  There are several runout sections especially up high as you traverse to the left to finish.  Mercifully the climbing is easier and the wall is steep but more than one climber has experienced an exhilarating fall there.

The three sections are divided by full recovery resting jugs. While the hardest power endurance moves are found low on the route the redpoint crux is high up on the wall as you are forced to make a precision move to the ""mail slot.""  Patient static climbers with great technical skills and lock off strength are well suited for this climb. Expect some sporting run outs.","{106961127: 4, 112340115: 4, 107521255: 4, 108726865: 4, 106200072: 4, 105790555: 4, 111088046: 4, 107603653: 4, 200404222: 4, 108429138: 4, 200480386: 4, 200212139: 4, 106456961: 4, 107016978: 4, 108279952: 4, 106859002: 4, 105878863: 4, 10768: 4, 106285308: 4, 15142: 4, 105982463: 4, 106870964: 4, 106144110: 4, 108358146: 4, 108248066: 4, 107191815: 4, 11509: 4, 110262540: 4, 110110376: 4, 106006184: 3}"

Begin by soloing up a chossy mess to the first bolt. Next negotiate a tenuous rightward traverse. From the third bolt to the seventh bolt expect slippery face climbing with two cruxy sections. At the overhanging finish, carefully set up on two shallow two finger pockets and get psyched to throw to a jug. The finish is physical and juggy so move quickly and clip the chains before you pump out.

Karate Crack,105790613.0,Trad,105789078.0,5.10a,60.0,1.0,3.1,204.0,"This is the ""fishhook"" shaped crack you see as you're hiking towards The Dihedrals area.  It is on the vertical wall immediately left of a low angle narrow ramp (ramp is the 1st pitch of Cinamon Slab route, 5.6).    The route has some short, not terribly thought-provoking, though kind of strenuous climbing.  And it is great fun!  Jam the crack which fluctuates from #3 to #1 Camalot size (hands to thin hands).  There are some face holds to take advantage of as well if you prefer.  At the top, the crack turns right and traverses for about 6 feet.  Step right into a deep chimney and downclimb 6 feet to bolted anchor inside chimney.","{15023: 4, 10116: 4, 105789175: 4, 105789684: 4, 105797754: 4, 106494505: 4, 107071499: 4, 106768265: 4, 107383190: 4, 106006184: 4, 106134676: 4, 106008830: 4, 106389541: 4, 106158624: 4, 106452833: 4, 106478055: 4, 106202961: 4, 106285308: 4, 107183802: 4, 107326021: 4, 107552570: 4, 107684440: 4, 105873502: 4, 106601971: 4, 108197152: 4, 108232388: 4, 105896358: 4, 107070156: 4, 107890277: 4, 107648448: 4, 109445128: 4, 105964643: 4, 109174966: 4, 109607807: 4, 108525386: 4, 107735421: 4, 107342926: 4, 108410332: 4, 109258388: 4, 108778861: 4, 107327535: 4, 108243919: 4, 108412656: 4, 110460691: 4, 110797288: 4, 108091988: 4, 107927787: 4, 110225880: 4, 108130441: 4, 106945549: 4, 106102182: 4, 200455675: 4, 200170248: 4, 105935712: 4, 106323170: 4, 107016978: 4, 106054402: 4, 200199619: 4, 112002240: 4, 105789785: 3, 10368: 3, 106976116: 3, 106156272: 3, 105878024: 3, 105906559: 3, 105870586: 3, 106776142: 3, 11331: 3, 105851688: 3, 105867264: 3, 105926493: 3, 106005650: 3, 105826001: 3, 106163753: 3, 107250964: 3, 105964496: 3, 105898385: 3, 105790555: 3, 106047496: 3, 106301735: 3, 105887867: 3, 106389004: 3, 107167101: 3, 107196826: 3, 106195320: 3, 106484179: 3, 107065676: 3, 105865653: 3, 107118298: 3, 10733: 3, 107935774: 3, 107656938: 3, 107636562: 3, 107646553: 3, 108852723: 3, 107715396: 3, 108425059: 3, 109369904: 3, 107510204: 3, 107910140: 3, 107664518: 3, 111426811: 3, 106058125: 3, 107043617: 3, 108028939: 3, 107933029: 3, 110967113: 3, 110731835: 3, 106470185: 3, 106399334: 3, 112323726: 3, 109353094: 3, 108266997: 3, 107435323: 3, 107356939: 3, 111448775: 3, 110459813: 3, 112908445: 3, 200000066: 3, 110835385: 3, 110547057: 3, 110494482: 3, 112106313: 3, 108254193: 3, 200070835: 3, 110114491: 3, 108230515: 3, 108307042: 3, 106074295: 3, 110529846: 3, 112413521: 3, 107603653: 3, 108149490: 3, 111992286: 3, 10544: 3, 11509: 3, 112002996: 3, 110094467: 3, 109613746: 3, 107734618: 3, 109280306: 3, 112207832: 3, 200211177: 3, 106405973: 3, 111185402: 3, 106325770: 3, 109541388: 3, 109546101: 3, 14380: 3, 200357245: 3, 200072833: 3, 111643513: 3, 200350043: 3, 200212139: 3, 200487761: 3, 113164188: 3, 111993695: 3, 200693652: 3, 110148614: 3, 12023: 3, 200415259: 3, 108302681: 3, 200216421: 3, 108552057: 3, 200128641: 3, 200815538: 3, 106870964: 2, 14568: 2, 105801073: 2, 106477440: 2, 106136895: 2, 107547214: 2, 105889270: 2, 105982463: 2, 107529159: 2, 106670517: 2, 106744745: 2, 106712274: 2, 106172718: 2, 107445995: 2, 108755823: 2, 107575405: 2, 109272253: 2, 110752881: 2, 111267403: 2, 106679556: 2, 111695941: 2, 106200072: 2, 107297910: 2, 106569451: 2, 107807406: 2, 112006024: 2, 112511507: 2, 200356179: 2, 111624139: 2, 111190382: 2, 112008242: 2, 110206802: 2, 109514934: 2, 106308715: 2, 107919778: 1, 107021325: 1, 105833503: 0}"

Karot Tots,106392598.0,Trad,105789078.0,5.11b,90.0,2.0,3.6,12.0,"Karot Tots was an important route in the history of Smith climbing, as it was one of the first routes to tackle the steep faces of the dihedrals.  Though essentially a crack climb, the route requires a few commiting face moves to traverse between the cracks.      Though classic & excellent, the route is a bit of a pain to climb, since it traverses so much.  The route turns two aretes, which compounds rope drag and makes it impossible to clean the route while lowering.  These factors have hampered the route's popularity, but if you have an adventurous mindset this route is a must do, and one of the best low-end 5.11s at Smith.    Begin up the classic Karate Crack.  Around 10 feet before the crack hooks right, traverse straight left, using a surprisingly slopey pocket, to gain the tail end of the thin, arching seam that snakes its way to the left arete of the Karate Wall.  Follow this seam past a bolt, placing bomber nuts or TCU's along the way.  As the seam turns horizontal it opens up, providing large jugs for the hand traverse.  Turn the corner, after which the difficulty eases substantially.  Continue traversing left around the next arete to a 2 bolt anchor.  Most folks rap off here, but its also possible to climb 5.6ish knobs up the low-angle, sparsely-bolted slab to the summit of the wall.  If rapping, beware that the rap route goes right over the popular Watts Tots & Latest Rage.","{106484179: 4, 106477440: 4, 110225880: 4, 11409: 4, 107192740: 4, 107146981: 4, 105878863: 4, 107975677: 4, 13115: 3, 200212139: 3, 200150942: 3, 110262540: 2}"

While not extremely pumpy it remains technically demanding to the chains.    Start by suffering through thin 5.11 slab moves past the first three bolts of Moondance.  No this is not the crux so try to hide the pain in your eyes as you make it past a series of small sharp edges. Next make a couple traverse moves to the fourth bolt.  From here move into the roof, clip a long sling and get a good stemming rest.  With some effort exit the roof out right using some insecure fin holds and a couple of small edges.  This is an insecure awkward crux, but it is rewarding nonetheless.    It just keeps getting better.  Once around the roof take a good shake then enter the most sequential section of the arête.  From here pinch/sidepull the arête and highstep your way through continuous technical arête climbing.  The right side of the arête features some small positive edges that may be hard to see.  The arête is probably around 12a and it is tons of fun if you have a decent idea of where the good holds are.    If you like death missions try the severely runout direct start to the route.

This climb is a pleasant way to top out at Smith, and a good lead for a new trad leader.    Climb the corner using perfect hand and fist jams, plus numerous features on the faces for feet and hands.  There is one short section of finger crack 2/3 of the way up where the gear thins, but it is easily passed in one or two moves and you don't have to finger jam to climb past.  At the top of the crack, step right and belay from the anchors above the first pitch of Bunny Face.    From the anchors on Bunny Face, you could rap to the ground.  Or top out by stepping down and right (slightly spooky, place a piece before you reach the bolts) and following the bolts on Bunny Face to the top (5.6).

Lurking above Latin Lover is a barely visible line of bolts stretching into an infinity of chalkless nubbins, edges, and pockets.  This is Peepshow.  While it's not necessarily the type of route you'll come back to do again and again, it is a route you should tick at least once in your life.    If Latin Lover goes well for you, then Peepshow should make for quick work.  Start up Latin Lover and at the 5th bolt, instead of traversing right to the anchor, continue straight up, wandering back and forth over the bolt line via unending balancy, edgy climbing.  I found the crux to be somewhere in the middle of the extension, but the real challenge will almost certainly be keeping it all together to the chains.  All in all a fantastic route that should really get more traffic.    A note on getting down: lowering off the top, my 70m just barely got me to the Latin Lover anchor where I had to clip in and pull/rethread.

Given 5.12c in the Watts Guide, this line is a big step up in difficulty from Full Heinous or Last Waltz.  Many a hard man has been spanked by the deceptive, continuous, funkery lurking innocently left of Take a Powder.      However, if you can get past the grade issue, this line offers a full (half) rope-length of stellar movement on Smith's top-shelf stone.      Begin with the first 3 bolts of Take a Powder.  Veer left along the obvious undercling flake, and tackle the subtle arete feature.  The first crux hits just above the 4th bolt, then a good clipping stance at the 5th, then the next crux, slapping the left hand up the arete with tricky feet and a difficult 2-finger pocket move.  Above the climbing eases slightly, but remains quite technical.      This route can feel pretty sharp if you pick a warm day.  There seems to be two ways to consider the grade:  5.12 moves with 5.13 beta, or 5.13 moves with 5.12 beta.

Slow Burn,105939846.0,Trad,105789078.0,5.11d,36.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"This bold line was the first route to venture above Karate Crack on the magnificent Karate Wall.  The route was established in ""Ground-Up"" fashion, with all of the original bolts placed on lead, hanging from hooks.  This was a common practice in the early 80's in areas such as Yosemite.  However, to truly appreciate the boldness of this ascent, consider the (poor) quality of the stone on the upper half of the pitch.    In its current state, this route is still a bold undertaking, with massive runouts on very spooky rock, and bird's nests in key pockets.  For this reason, this route is almost never climbed, even by the hourdes of topropers that monopolize the wall on a daily basis.    Rope drag on this pitch can be significant as the line wanders considerably, and even with the route's sparse protection you will be towing more than 30m of rope at the top.    Begin up Karate Crack.  When the crack turns horizontal, head straight up to the first large hueco (as for Crossfire).  If you desire, stuff a #3 Camalot in this pocket then head directly left to the other large hueco slightly higher and 8 feet left (as for Power Dive).  Clip the bolt just above the hueco, (probably with a really long sling, unless you are using double ropes) then crank the crux move, a heinous crank on a sloping 2-finger pocket to a large rail.  Traverse right along the rail, clipping Crossfire's 2nd bolt, then continue right-wards past Crossfire, to a dark brown, chalkless wall of creaking nobs and pidgeon nests.     The route continues, mostly from large pocket to large pocket, up and right, ever-steepening as you ascend.  Pass two more bolts, then the final crux: crimping on rounded edges.  A long runout leads to the final enormous hueco.  De-pump and  place a tipped-out #3 (or perhaps #3.5 or #4) Camalot in this pocket.  10 more feet on easing terrain lead to the last bolt, and a final runout on huge knobs and flexing flakes to the top of the wall.    In this day and age, it might make more sense (rope-drag-wise) to head straight up from Karate Crack, thru the Crossfire crux, then veer right, rather than climbing through the left hueco.

To Bolt Or Not To Be,105880873.0,Sport,105789078.0,5.14a,135.0,1.0,3.8,4.0,"Among the most famous routes in the world, this legendary wall of relentless edges played a seminal role in the consolidiation of Sport Climbing in the US.  As the first 5.14a in North America, this route's haughty grade focused national attention on local tactics, while luring the world's elite free-climbers to an unknown backwater rest-stop in rural Oregon.  Perhaps more than any other route of the era, To Bolt demonstrated the unique benefits of the ""top-down"" approach.  If nothing else, surely this was a route worth hang-dogging for.    For more than 20 years, hardmen from around the world have tangled with To Bolt's tiny crimps since French patron ""JB"" Tribout first freed the line in late 1986.  Alan Watts, the Father of American Sport Climbing, once posited that virtually every elite climber of the last 20 years had attempted the line, or had at least contemplated it, and thought better of it.  Scott Franklin, Jerrry Moffat, Ron Kauk, Alan Watts, Doug Englekirk, Steve Schneider, Lynn Hill, Chris Sharma, Dave Graham, Tommy Caldwell, Beth Rodden, Sonny Trotter, Steve McClure...the list of folks who've ticked this wall reads like a Who's Who of free climbing.    In addition to its intriguing history, unparalleled movement, flawless golden tuff and an awe-inspiring appearance warrant the line's ultra-classic status.      For the redpoint climber, To Bolt offers countless challenges.  With so many difficult moves, numerous factors must come together for the send.  Weather, shoes, fitness, skin, where & when to rest, and how to clip--all these come into play.  The route is perhaps as much a psychological challenge as a physical one, with the redpoint crux coming down to the climber's ability to keep focus over the last five bolts of relatively easier stone, and suppress the leg-rattling notion that the send is in the bag.    The route begins tamely enough, with 3 bolts of fairly mellow 5.12- liebacking up a series of left-facing sidepulls.  There is a difficult left-hand mono move below the first bolt, and an easy sinker mono for the right-hand at the 3rd bolt.  The first difficult clip comes at the fourth bolt, just before the first crux, a 5.12 rightward traverse on sharp, purple crimps and un-inspiring foot divots.  Opposing sidepulls and high-steps lead to a 1/4"" polished crimp and the tenuous fifth clip.  The real business comes in the next few bolts.  For crux #2, gaston up and left to a series of 5.13- deadpoints to thin, sharp crimps and a core intensive clipping stance.  Clip #6, chalk up and kiss your skin goodbye as you tickle the 1/8"" crimps of the next 5.13 crux.  Moving from 6 to 7 is the hardest bit of climbing, and it comes with a  considerable pump, but good balance is the key to reaching the sickle-shaped sidepull and an extremely insecure clipping stance.  A brief shake & chalk is possible here, before continuing thru crux #4 via sequential 5.12-ish footwork & hip shifting.  Clip the 8th bolt with ease, then a series of super-high-steps and long lockoffs lead to the ninth bolt and the first real rest: a rounded 1"" crimp with decent feet.      After a good shake, beta-intensive 5.13- crux #5 heads up and left on rounded crimps and long cranks, to a slopey pod rest at the tenth bolt.  From here to the chains is considered 5.12d, but should not be underestimated, as there are many heart-breaking moves in the last 5 bolts.  A few moderate moves lead to a large bear-hug flake at the 11th bolt, and one final shake before the last 5.12/13- crux.  Delicate footwork and tiny crimps work up & left to the ""crescent-shaped"" hold, an awkward clip and one last hard crank to a series of horizontal crack pods.  From here, things ease somewhat as the pump builds.  Long sequential lockoffs between bigger holds with better feet keep things moving chain-ward, but don't allow for any real ""Thank-God"" rest.  After clipping 14, an awkward & balancey step left leads to an ascending leftward traverse, crossing delicately to large slopey pockets and a bomber clipping jug on the arete.

With virtually no pro for the first 30 feet, any mistake will put you in the hospital or worse.  However, the route is easily toproped (via Hesitation Blues), and makes an excellent jaunt on a hot day when shade is desired.    The route begins with easy climbing to a shallow crack where the first worthless #1 TCU placement is found.  Another ten feet up on steadily shrinking crimps leads to a worthless RP placement, and a horizontal pocket that looks like it might take a cam, but probably won't.  Next is the crux: step up high with the left foot, then rock-over onto the foot using a good sidepull in the seam.  Cross your right hand over to a heavily chalked flake hold.  From here you can place the first piece of gear that might arrest a fall.      From here continue with relative ease into the upper bit of Hesitation Blues and its plentiful gear placements.

Burning Churches,116077707.0,Sport,105789143.0,5.12b,300.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,"There are a lot of reasons why Burning Churches may never be a classic. The crux is hard, the rock is crumbly, and worst of all for the main area, it's more than one pitch. That said, it's got a few things going for it as well. The position is spectacular, the movement is bewildering and excellent and one hundred percent Smith, the rock isn't bad (by local standards) where it matters, and it weaves its way up a gorgeous orange face to a breathtaking summit right there in the heart of the frontside. Plus you don't even have to go for much of a walk to find an adventure.  [P1 - 5.11+ or 5.11a] There are a few ways to start the climb depending on whether you prefer 5.12 sport or 5.11 trad as you climb existing terrain to get to the route. The first option allows you to climb from bottom to top with nothing more than draws, but it does involve a less-than-stellar section down low on The Clam. For that version, start near the base of the Testament Slab and scramble onto the block to the right of The Left Side of the Beard route and climb past three bolts to the top at 5.8 or 5.9. Either belay there, or continue up The Clam to its anchor. The Clam is alleged to have gotten more difficult over the years as holds have reportedly broken, but it feels like not super-fun .11+/.12- at the moment with a tricky boulder problem off the ledge giving way to enjoyable 5.10 to the anchors. The difficulty of the climbing at the start of the route may recommend belaying from the top of The Beard, but you can pull through the crux if you need to.  Your other starting options involve climbing Wartley's Revenge either to the top of the first or second pitch. It's possible to either cut left on the ledge at the top of the first pitch and join The Clam just above the crux for the enjoyable 5.10 to the belay, or link the first two pitches of Wartley's, and join Burning Churches in the middle of the second pitch. For this option belay on bolts just above the hanging belay/lower-off at the top of Wartley's P2 and continue from there, skipping The Clam and the first few bolts of BC entirely.  [P2 - 5.11a/b] Climb up and right from the top of The Clam to clip the anchor at the top of the second pitch of Wartley's Revenge and continue up the bolted ramp past a tricky crux to a hanging belay in the middle of the face.  [P3 - 5.12b] Climb the right side of the face before entering a conspicuous section of black rock high on the wall below an obvious, imposing roof. Get a rest, then launch up some excellent steep climbing to a bouldery crux on thin holds to reach the base of the roof and a pumpy traverse out left and around it. From here the rock sadly deteriorates to awful, but the climbing eases from 5.12 to 5.7 and the challenge becomes finding holds you can pull on. Unpleasant pawing leads to heaven-sent pockets and a few more bolts to the top.  Descent: Once again, you have options. From the top of the route, traverse towards the summit via a brief, easy ridge and make a short rappel from another anchor to the big ledge on climber’s right between The Friar and The Abbott and another bolt anchor, then down to the top of the second pitch of Wartley’s and from there to the ground. It may also be possible to rappel from the anchor at the top of the climb to the anchor at the base of the final pitch, but the author can’t recall how feasible this is due to the overhang at the top and the swinging required to get right to the anchor. Apologies for the ambiguity, but on the first ascent of the final pitch I lowered back to the belay as I stripped the draws and didn’t have to deal with the rappel. If rapping from the bottom of P3, a single rap will get you to the top of The Clam, and another will have you on the ground.",{106231822: 3}

If my memory serves me, Watts says, 'Boldly layback the start'.  Without 6 inch cams or big bros, this would be Bold indeed.  I only had one 6 inch cam with me, and it was not easy to place in the crack that turned out to be mostly a little bigger than 6 inches.  The crux is at about thirty feet, just before you pull over the lip halfway, so if you only have one, bring that baby with you to protect the crux.  I ended up soloing that section, laybacking and smearing on birdshit, with my 6 inch cam 15 feet below me.  The upper squeeze section is fun, clean, and a different flavor than most of Smith.

A good stemming rest below the crux provides an opportunity to scope out the difficulties--awkward moves up a shallow arete with rounded feet.

The climbing is pretty easy (5.7) for the first pitch, with a bit of a possible challenge at a well-protected roof about 40' up. Beware though, because all although there are myriad placements, the overall picture is one of a giant conglomeration in a gully of choss. Minimize rope drag at the beginning because the climbing turns into runout 5.6 to the ""anchors"" (the big yellow Smith guidebook says there are anchors) which is an old (1/4"") bolt w/ a thin hanger. Unless you brought the big gear for the second pitch with you, I only saw one crack to build an anchor with the gear I had left. And yes it is still all choss.         The second pitch consists of about 20' or so of mank over a bulge with good feet and hand jams to where the reason to climb the route to begin with is located, the 35' feet of good 5.8 off-width. This is where the ""R"" in the rating comes in if you don't have the big bros, or can't place them because of all the undulations. The crack did widen up enough for me to get totally in between it, with great views through the other side of Smith of the Cascades. The chimeny squeezes shut to a proper 5.8 off-width again just below the top-out, at which there are about 6 pieces of sun-beat webbing slung around reasonably sized boulder. Plenty of room up there for two people to stand, though I wouldn't recommend belaying someone up there who will be jostling and jangling on the rope while squirreling their way up the OW.         Bottom line is, this is one climb that the Smith guidebook's description is lacking, though understandable since it isn't climbed often due to the poor quality of rock. Be prepared to build anchors (not something most at Smith tend to do) and wear a helmet because you and your partner will be kicking rocks and pebbles down the whole time. I'm pretty sure you could rap from the top of the second pitch, which is only maybe 60' feet long, with two 70' m, but since we rapped from the top of the first pitch with two 70's, and there was plenty of rope on the ground, I can only make an intelligent guess on that one. If you're looking for a bit of adventure climbing and want to do something different from the usual Smith sport, then this will be a few fun hours.  ","{200326525: 2, 107444178: 1, 107847782: 1}"

From here ascend a face with numerous pockets that are fun and quite juggy.  Move right for four bolts and then back left and up to the anchors.  The rock is fairly solid through this pitch and is the best pitch of Heathen's Highway.     For the next pitch traverse right and up into a crack.  This pitch would be cool if climbed more, but is very loose and dirty (and is one reason for the pg-13 grade I gave it).  On top of this crack is a small chimney that leads to an anchor on the left side of the corridor.     Pitch 4 climbs a very loose slab to the summit of the Friar and has one new bolt and a few old homemade bolts (the other reason for the pg-13).

You'll find that it is a little bit safer than BBQ the Pope, especially at the bottom where it has 3 bolts to BBQ's 2.  Expect intellectual climbing for the first half and a line that slowly merges towards BBQ towards the end.

Rawhide,106308405.0,Sport,105789143.0,5.11d,40.0,1.0,2.9,14.0,The first ten feet of rawhide is overhanging and strenuous as you pull through a sea of pockets and edges.  A variety of sequences will get you to the first bolt.  Consider stick clipping the first bolt if you have any doubt about the bouldery start.    After the first bolt the climbing eases as you traverse leftward on horizontal edges.  The crux comes at the third bolt where you are forced to use some greasy small holds.  A long crank establishes you on a good jug and moderate climbing takes you to the anchors.    This is not a good route to do in the sun.  The holds can get very greasy.      Down cleaning is hard due to the traversing nature of the climb.  It is easiest to get a friend to follow and clean the route.,"{200212139: 4, 107184020: 4, 110752881: 3, 108248066: 3, 106494476: 3, 105981534: 3, 108358146: 3, 106144110: 3, 106389004: 3, 106006184: 3, 106285308: 3, 110262540: 2, 107603653: 2, 11509: 2}"

After all the prep got done, the FA got passed on to John Collins for a fathers day gift.     Start off on a powerful start leaving the ledge passing the first bolt. If the right sequence is found, it seems 5.10, but it is easy to use powerful beta here. Climb to the 3rd bolt before the the climbing begins to get hard again. From the 3rd bolt, expect sustained climbing for the grade till the last bolt is clipped. Getting to the last bolt, you can either go left (more technical) or right (more powerful but less technical). I though going left seems more locker and probably easier, but I bolted it so you can go either way.    Enjoy!!","{108248066: 3, 106378922: 3, 108358146: 3, 200240855: 3, 200044470: 2, 200063563: 2}"

Good climbing on mostly positive chickenheads but not too memorable. Alternatively the pitch above your belay bolts also reaches the next belay. 5.10-    P4:  the business. After threatening all hikers below on the  choss before the first bolt, pull a fantastic roof crack requiring some beefcake moves and a possible heel hook or two. No more than 3 cams required (#.75 #2 C4 #2 metolius). The 5 inch mentioned in the guidebook will not help you on this pitch.  We thought this climbed like a softer version of Rio's crack in the Sads. 5.11+    P5:  deceptively good stone leads to some of the worst rock of the route, ready to launch rockets at your belayer. At the final bolt mantle to the right NOT to the left.  5.10 choss    P6:  after moving around exfoliating rock climb up through good pockets and bad footholds as you watch the vultures circle below. 5.10    Pick a quiet day to do this one and bring a helmet.","{105797754: 3, 106495144: 2}"

Delicate opening moves give way to excellent incut jugs and crimps up a gradually steepening corner. One hard move at the finish brings you to an anchor around to the right. Fun movement (reminiscent of Panic Attack) on better rock. 10 bolts.P3: 5.11, 35m. Scramble up to the base of the headwall, clip the first bolt, and commit to steep moves on good holds. The angle rolls over pretty quickly, but the moves stay on you as you climb up the slabby, splitter seam. Step right to the anchor. 8 bolts and gear.P4: 5.12, 25m. Walk over to the right side of the arete and clip the first bolt. Be self-aware moving to the second bolt as the first bolt isn't going to do much to keep you from landing on the belay ledge. The moves wouldn't be too bad to reverse if you realized you weren't going to make it, but are by no means trivial. After that it's classic thin slab climbing up the right side of the arete with amazing exposure and position. This would be a tough onsight without chalked holds. 6 bolts.This pitch can be avoided by climbing the bolt line immediately above the belay at 5.11.

Good holds lead right to a line of bolts up a spectacular headwall with awesome climbing on good rock. 7 bolts and gear.P6: 5.5, 15m. Optional. We didn't do it, but it looked pretty mellow, if a little loose. I don't think there's a rap anchor, but the topo indicates a bolt.

I know of few other places in the US that have such a high concentration of multi-pitch sport bolted routes than the Smith Rock Group.  That said, there's always something a little spicy about them, and this route is no exception.   An easy approach, great bolting, good rock (except the last pitch), and reasonable moves make Lost in Space one of the more accessible routes that tops out the formation.     All bolt counts are approximate.   Pitch 1 (8 bolts): 5.6.  Follow the bolts up the chimney and onto the fin to the left.  Pass the first anchors, and belay on top of the big ledge.   Pitch 2 (6 bolts): 10b.  Crank sloping edges up a vertical/slightly overhanging wall for ten feet, and finish on an easy slab.  Fun pitch. Give it to the more thuggish partner.     Pitch 3 (10 bolts): 10a.  The best pitch of the route, I thought.  Connive your way through tricky edges for a long way.  Nicely bolted, fun moves, and most of the rock is quite solid.  Enjoy the nice belay ledge at the top, and maybe set yourself up so you are sitting under the overhang.  This will help protect you from rockfall on the last pitch.   Pitch 4 (10 bolts): 5.9. Starting this pitch, you think, ""Oh, this isn't so bad.""  Just give it time- you will change your mind.  Thankfully, the bolt line meanders, so you aren't climbing directly above your partner for the whole thing.  There is still a chance of braining your partner, though, so be careful, and everyone needs a helmet.    Just a thought, it might be possible to cheat right after the third pitch into the gully.  You would want to belay this procedure, and it could be completely heinous.  As dirty as the final pitch is, I think it's worth it so that you get to top out.

Season's Change,106679458.0,Sport,105826813.0,5.11b,400.0,6.0,2.7,18.0,"Season's Change is six pitches of exposed climbing on one of the least visited sections of Smith Rock.  Expect long pitches of pebbling, with shiny new bolts everywhere, and only occasional run-outs.   As of now (early 2010), the route still suffers from poor rock.  On the bright side, some sections of Smith feel as though they will never be clean, but this isn't one of them.  With a dozen more ascents (or one ascent specifically for cleaning), this route will likely be solid, and completely amazing.  Bring helmets, call ""rock"", and be comforted by the fact that almost all pitches wander a bit away from the belay.  The first pitch may never be very good, but the rest should clean up nicely.   It was a mistake to climb this route in the winter without adequate clothing, but that was not clear until we were high on the wind-whipped wall and psychologically committed to finishing. Retreat was physically possible, but unthinkable.   For us, Season's Change was a formidable route, and worth the time.  In better conditions, it may have been enjoyable, but the brutal conditions, and the necessity of rising to the boldness of the route were more than adequate substitutes for joy.  A great adventure sport route, with the safety of modern hardware.    All bolt numbers are approximate - bring extra draws and a runner or two.   Pitch 1 (10a): 7 bolts.  Make your way over a couple of big lumps, clip at 20 feet, and then execute a miserable traverse.   Pitch 2 (10b): 12 bolts.  Step left from the belay, and then launch onto the long, pebbled face with a low and a high crux.  The top of this pitch has the only completely seated belay.  All others are hanging, or partially hanging.   Pitch 3 (10+/11-): 11 bolts.  Straight above the last pitch, power your way through a series of tough moves on difficult to spot holds in a bulge, and then rejoice on jugs on the face above. Finally, work through one of the easier sections of climbing to the base of the fourth pitch.  Watts gives this 10c, but the crux moves are harder than that.   There's another pitch that starts up the left side; ignore it and attack the bulge/overhang.   Pitch 4 (11b): 12 bolts.  The crux pitch, and unfortunately, it isn't the cleanest.  The crux is right off the belay, but it is fairly sustained for another fifty feet.  Take care on the easier upper section - this is one of the dirtier parts of the whole cliff, and more than one hold exploded in my face.   If I remember right, there is also a pitch heading up left from the base of this pitch - take the line on the right.   Pitch 5 (10a): 4 bolts.  A fun traverse on good rock, with a momentarily baffling crux at the end.  Thankfully, the tight bolting makes for a stress-free follow.  Awesome exposure!   Pitch 6 (10c): 12 bolts.  Another long pitch of pebbling and edging, this pitch could really use some cleaning.  The belay at the top is heavenly, with amazing views of the main area, monkey face, and beyond.","{200244913: 4, 106047496: 3, 107734618: 3, 112006024: 3, 107884874: 3, 110807723: 3, 106445962: 3, 110428332: 3, 106513424: 3, 108543653: 3, 107160134: 3, 105797754: 3, 106008830: 2, 111624139: 2, 200070835: 2, 106477440: 2, 107622720: 2, 200526561: 2}"

The Struggle Within,106795686.0,Sport,105826813.0,5.11d,500.0,4.0,3.0,11.0,"Sometimes technical, sometimes powerful, this long and involved route is an exhilarating experience.  The Struggle Within has great position, cool cruxes, requires power and endurance, has good protection, and has surprisingly good rock.     It is composed of four pitches.  All bolt recommendations are approximate:    Pitch 1 (5.11a, 11 bolts + anchors).  A mix of 5.9 to 5.10 stemming, laybacking, edging, etc. leads to a crux traverse to the left.  Sequential enough that I had to downclimb out of my dead-end and go back up to do it right.  Don't tire yourself out, you have a long way to go.  Make sure to traverse to the left two bolts before the anchor that sits straight up.  The climbing is easy by the time you can clip the last bolt, but clip it for the follower (Wish I had - sorry Jason).  Belay on a cushy ledge to the left, below a sharp flake/hand crack.      Pitch 2 (5.11c, 11 bolts + anchors).  The best pitch of the route.  Conserve energy by climbing efficiently in the crack, and tackle a powerful roof.  From here, edge and pocket your way for the other half of the route.  Belay at a tight perch.  Pumpy and cool as hell.    Pitch 3 (5.8, 6 bolts, 1 red or yellow camalot (hand sized) + anchors).  Decent climbing and awesome position, but it's on mossy rock.  The distance between bolts, combined with the moss give it a touch of seriousness, but it's not that bad.    Pitch 4 (5.11d, 11 bolts + anchors).  The hardest and most incredible pitch.  I preferred the second to this one, but this one is exciting for the higher level of difficulty.     Start on a crumbling, frightening arete/face, and run it out between good bolts on mostly good holds.  This will put you below the roof.    Pulling the roof is the hardest section, but the crux of the route is surely holding it together for the headwall.  It's difficult to tell what holds are solid and what aren't, and it is a long pitch requiring thought.  Some of these moves may be 5.10+ or 5.11-.  A great pitch that will, in time, clean up nicely and feel like Lion Zion, only with an 11+ move in the middle.     Above the hardest climbing, the angle kicks back.  The final run to the anchor is easy climbing, but kind of freaky.  At one point, you don't have a solid hold for either of your hands or feet, and are about twenty feet run-out.  I think you could get a hand sized cam in up there, but I didn't have one with me.    A good comparison is Gulag Archipelago, one of the best multi-pitch routes at Smith, but this route has better position, harder cruxes, and is significantly more sustained.  Its black eye is imperfect rock - but with good bolts, that just makes it more exciting, right?  A great adventure sport route.","{106047496: 4, 200118368: 4, 108188495: 4, 107737478: 3, 110154304: 3, 107342926: 3, 200212139: 3, 106398311: 3, 106495144: 2, 109218898: 2, 105807147: 2}"

You start down low in a short but hard dihedral with three bolts in the first 12 or so feet of climbing.    After that, romp up the rest of this extremely long route on great holds with good feet, carefully managing your body position to avoid getting pumped. Don't let your guard down though, there are one or two moves on this that are a little awkward despite the generally high quality climbing.    There are a lot of bolts on this one, so you wind up being able to backclean two or three draws pretty easily. There is one bolt near the top when you hit the big layback flake that is pretty far off route to the right. The falls are safe and the climbing secure so I skipped it. You're risking a fairly big whip but it seems less scary than traversing to the bolt.    Good first 11a for a gym climber well versed in big holds on slightly overhanging terrain. Not terribly technically difficult, mostly a fitness check, and definitely onsightable.","{107679617: 4, 106812895: 4, 107992165: 4, 107154237: 4, 108958835: 4, 106601971: 4, 109632269: 4, 109258734: 4, 108295148: 4, 107867671: 4, 107737478: 4, 110785482: 4, 107528726: 4, 110271502: 4, 108967941: 4, 111810451: 4, 109613746: 4, 111029678: 4, 112340115: 4, 111952132: 4, 200051409: 4, 109462677: 4, 107313996: 4, 111989270: 4, 200092998: 4, 111948265: 4, 200063508: 4, 200240855: 4, 110669338: 4, 106838734: 4, 111130479: 4, 112250778: 4, 200285884: 4, 112089625: 4, 106542095: 4, 200170248: 4, 108383947: 4, 110755265: 4, 107277941: 4, 112161641: 4, 200188254: 4, 200075560: 4, 200158663: 4, 110177459: 4, 111885672: 4, 112386569: 4, 108091672: 4, 113168176: 4, 200118368: 4, 200667635: 4, 200088269: 4, 111823469: 4, 200278987: 4, 200418610: 4, 200273027: 4, 200274088: 4, 200580270: 4, 105794408: 3, 106389004: 3, 10382: 3, 106744745: 3, 106477440: 3, 106874601: 3, 14568: 3, 106881277: 3, 107920516: 3, 108188495: 3, 107818591: 3, 107919778: 3, 107648448: 3, 109559136: 3, 107475857: 3, 105825953: 3, 107890277: 3, 106378922: 3, 107764168: 3, 110072129: 3, 108059680: 3, 106860947: 3, 108975346: 3, 106610639: 3, 106761693: 3, 109308102: 3, 108756654: 3, 108412656: 3, 108338368: 3, 110530156: 3, 111734070: 3, 111536136: 3, 110206802: 3, 108288491: 3, 107529159: 3, 107805637: 3, 107847782: 3, 107099407: 3, 111833511: 3, 105996074: 3, 107723931: 3, 106517269: 3, 107829049: 3, 112323726: 3, 109463002: 3, 108243919: 3, 111680549: 3, 110937405: 3, 111781359: 3, 110641817: 3, 112106313: 3, 110262540: 3, 110268695: 3, 110878497: 3, 112010398: 3, 106922041: 3, 111901652: 3, 111448775: 3, 105801073: 3, 109373073: 3, 110547057: 3, 200173263: 3, 111024305: 3, 110997740: 3, 7008080: 3, 107908955: 3, 112002996: 3, 106449525: 3, 106569451: 3, 110735352: 3, 200354948: 3, 111282664: 3, 107603653: 3, 105913057: 3, 106308715: 3, 107734618: 3, 107184020: 3, 200159225: 3, 107870857: 3, 112511507: 3, 105797645: 3, 105798590: 3, 200458445: 3, 110750765: 3, 200454486: 3, 200202844: 3, 200212139: 3, 107545559: 3, 111664966: 3, 112180232: 3, 200587713: 3, 112551257: 3, 111697855: 3, 200594520: 3, 200299394: 3, 200235611: 3, 112512805: 3, 110494482: 3, 106822061: 3, 200038210: 3, 111658578: 3, 107132736: 3, 200415259: 3, 110731835: 3, 200200801: 3, 107696894: 3, 108690530: 3, 200246689: 3, 200136212: 3, 200449836: 3, 110729900: 3, 113522523: 3, 200263526: 3, 200762782: 3, 200044470: 3, 111397011: 3, 112550809: 3, 106870964: 2, 106892871: 2, 105797324: 2, 107946583: 2, 108279952: 2, 106398311: 2, 108248066: 2, 109037301: 2, 106422719: 2, 110718577: 2, 111114330: 2, 108230515: 2, 111671426: 2, 107211050: 2, 107521255: 2, 109607267: 2, 106795373: 2, 110585520: 2, 200031206: 2, 106323170: 2, 112006024: 2, 107085584: 2, 200654407: 2, 200216421: 2, 107741581: 2, 107152512: 2, 108266997: 1, 109206113: 1, 106440579: 1, 200109683: 1, 200479596: 1}"

The route is marred by 20' of bad rock to start, but the bolts are close enough that if you've climbed enough Smith or Utah desert choss I don't think you'll mind. The rest of the climb is worth it if you're up for it - sunny rock, quality climbing, and a great position far away from the throngs below might make it a fun distraction for a solid chossineer looking to get away for the day.     P1 (5.10b): Climb past a crumbling corner to gain an overlap below a clean red face. Pull onto the face and forget the choss below as you head up through knobs and edges to a wild overhanging prow of huecos. Surmount the prow and continue up a clean slab to a two-bolt anchor. (~38m, 14 bolts, optional gear)     P2 (5.7): Step left off the anchor and pull into the water groove which takes you to the ridge. (30m, bolts & gear)    You can rap to the ground from here with a 70m rope, or you can go for an adventure and continue up the ridge via 3rd to low 5th class climbing to the plateau above Vulture Gully. From there you can top out Smith Summit's towers via the west face routes, or walk off via the trail past Cod Rock.","{106712274: 4, 110731835: 3, 107445987: 3, 106231822: 2, 200271128: 2, 200103445: 2}"

This moderate, somewhat sequential climbing is a treat.","{105790762: 4, 107250964: 4, 106095995: 4, 10116: 4, 106212982: 4, 106163972: 4, 15023: 4, 106759927: 4, 106107186: 4, 108542105: 4, 108279275: 4, 107847782: 4, 112908445: 4, 112006024: 4, 112263830: 4, 111231935: 4, 110331339: 4, 108854446: 4, 112413521: 4, 109709341: 4, 200890040: 4, 106858993: 3, 107083009: 3, 107342926: 3, 106265516: 3, 106918913: 3, 106047496: 3, 105973110: 3, 105826001: 3, 106892871: 3, 106874601: 3, 107196826: 3, 107827482: 3, 107417978: 3, 106249742: 3, 107890277: 3, 105837552: 3, 105797645: 3, 106946154: 3, 108696002: 3, 109443176: 3, 107715396: 3, 108412656: 3, 108338368: 3, 107656555: 3, 108475529: 3, 109284392: 3, 108122674: 3, 107904140: 3, 111028791: 3, 112323726: 3, 109624383: 3, 110151691: 3, 110835385: 3, 111553778: 3, 107768989: 3, 108009491: 3, 112106313: 3, 110797288: 3, 111112991: 3, 111155307: 3, 108254193: 3, 200168106: 3, 108230515: 3, 112002996: 3, 200246238: 3, 200120443: 3, 107786030: 3, 7009367: 3, 200340779: 3, 200075560: 3, 110965253: 3, 200177081: 3, 112511507: 3, 109492070: 3, 106088454: 3, 7091916: 3, 111993695: 3, 12023: 3, 107016978: 3, 112254411: 3, 113164188: 3, 111787571: 3, 200061987: 3, 200635700: 3, 106158624: 2, 106780021: 2, 106477440: 2, 107140193: 2, 108130441: 2, 106542095: 2, 109258734: 2, 109443890: 2, 109177262: 2, 109541594: 2, 112418846: 2, 112074286: 2, 200064270: 2, 111185402: 2, 108149490: 2, 10544: 2, 107327702: 2, 112782114: 2, 200530401: 2, 200216421: 2, 107071499: 1, 106052853: 1}"
Spiderman,105793920.0,Trad,105793916.0,5.7,180.0,2.0,3.5,385.0,Spiderman is one of the great moderate trad climbs at Smith. This crack on the tuft is surprisingly solid and has some surprisingly exciting moves for such a moderately graded climb.  Pitch 1: 5.6 Begin on the right side of a large ramp. Climb up a right angling crack to a bolted anchor on the left. . . or continue on and link up pitch 2  Pitch 2: 5.7 Continue up the hand crack in the dihedral above. Belay at bolt anchors on the face.  Pitch 3: 5.7 From the belay move right into a seam that quickly opens into a fingercrack. Take this crack to the improbable roof. Pull the roof and continue up easy climbing to a chain anchor on top. Watch rope drag!  Alternate Pitch 3: This easier but less popular variation lacks the luster of the regular finish. From the belay you can take the crack heading up and left avoiding the roof.  Descent: You can rappel the route with two ropes but pulling the ropes can be nasty.  A walk off descent to climber's right requires a bit of scrambling but is potentially less hassle.  There is occasionally a fixed rope to assist the descent.,"{105789175: 4, 105790762: 4, 105801073:

It's possible to start at the very base of the tower using the Sheer Trickery approach, but rumor has it Sheer Trickery is harder than the crux pitch of the Backbone (and considering the fire power of the FA group - Wolfgang Gullich, Ron Kauk, and Alan Watts - it's easy to believe).    The most expedient approach is to traverse the 5.6 choss band from below the start of Spank the Monkey.  Once on the arete, you will likely be a bit nauseated by the exposure, so you might want to take it bolt to bolt the first time up.  The crux pitch starts out pretty casual with some ultra-exposed and reachy 5.11 edging.  After 4 bolts or so, the North Face flake crack splits out to the left.  Get a good rest here, then tackle the first technical crux.  It's possible to 'cheat' past this first crux by climbing on the left side of the arete, and reaching around the corner to clip.  The bolt line is recommended for a pure ascent, but since you get a full recovery before the real crux, the left variation probably does little to affect the route's overall difficulty.    Another excellent rest on the left side of the arete allows you to depump for the final dynamic, airy and overhanging crux section: a rising traverse from the left arete to the right, up the widest part of the narrow face.  There's no way to climb around this section!  Once you reach the right arete the business is over, and a few easy moves lead to a no-hands rest and optional anchor.    The 3rd pitch goes at a terrifying 12a.  If it were 12c, you would have the option of dogging it and working out the moves like on P2, but since its ""only"" 12a, you're pretty much obliged to go for the onsight, which is a tad spicy to say the least.  This pitch starts out pretty steep with good holds, but gives way to some mossy slab climbing.    Once in the west cave, two exits are possible.  The pure line begins with a jump to the first hold, and attacks a steep line of jugs straight above the backbone.  Or you can always slink out the 11b Monkey Space exit to the left.

The crux crack pitch can be climbed in two pitches, but is much more classic and challenging as one mega pitch.  Be sure to use a 60m rope for this option.    Considered by many to be 12b, the crux pitch requires a multitude of skills and abilities, not the least of which is the ability to place gear while pumped.

Northwest Passage (Free),111164272.0,Trad,105791048.0,5.12,400.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,"This classic linkup of two of Smith's best finger cracks is rarely done in its entirety, but is more than a worthy objective for those up to the task.  Expect to have to make some 5.10 moves above pretty small gear in soft rock.    Pitch 1: The West Face. Either french free up the right hand bolt ladder until you can climb the pinned out tips crack or start via Sheer Trickery to the left at '12c.'  Sheer Trickery is stout.  Once in the crack, start by pulling through some easier moves on slightly suspect gear. As the gear improves, the difficulty increases, culminating in a punchy sequence of finger and tips locks on an immaculate, slabby splitter.  Once above the crux, continue up a shallow off-set with less than stellar rock quality past some bolts.      After clipping the second bolt you have a choice:  the Watts guide recommends climbing straight up the bolts to the large ledge (the traditional West Face anchor) and then beginning the second pitch by  climbing up and left on bolts around the arete to access the North Face crack.  This is not your best choice as the bolts are old, the leader will be out of sight on the second pitch, and your rope is running over the arete.  A better alternative is to clip the second bolt after the offset with a long sling and traverse left via thin edging to the arete.  Once established on the arete, you can clip a bolt and are poised to balance up a slightly licheny slab directly below the North Face anchor.    35m, 12c (sandy) or 12a A0    Pitch 2: If you went left early, simply climb the North Face as is described elsewhere on here.  If you went straight up to the West Face ledge, climb past four older bolts up and left on the arete until you can step around to access the North Face crack.  As has been said, this pitch is long and pumpy.  No move is really that hard, but it feels endless.  In terms of pro, there are two ways to look at this pitch:  You can protect with bomber gear every 10-20' (standard Smith Rock bolt spacing) or you can try and fiddle in thinner/more marginal gear in addition to/between the good placements.  It's easy to burn a lot of energy trying to protect this pitch.   60m, 12a    Pitch 3: From the West Face Cave, climb on bolts through very steep terrain out of the cave.  This is the 3rd pitch of Monkey Space.  If the second comes off in the wrong spot, they might not be able to get back to the wall.  Plan accordingly.   25m, 11b    Descent:  It's possible to rappel from the two bolt anchor on the right side of the floor of the Mouth (just below the beginning of the 'panic point pitch') back to the base of the route with a single 70m.  The rope pull is hard, but doable and facilitates rapping with a single.  As of late September, it was equipped with two quick links, but could use two more.  If I make it back up there, I'll fix it up.",{106049062: 4}

It was an exciting venture and an exciting route (really it's just a long and exposed boulder problem several hundred feet off the deck).      Start a little left of the middle of the cave and climb out the overhang, doing gymnastic moves and some campusing while veering rightward.      I placed two cams in a rotten horizontal shelf about 10 feet into the climb.  If these blow you will take a factor two fall, your rope tightening over the 90 degree lip of the cave.  This would be very bad and I think the climb deserves an R/X rating (I bounced tested the placements before I lead the route and they held.  They might hold a lead fall).    After this do a really spectacular move that involves an undercling jug, a heal hook, and a little crimper fin.  So neat!

First Kiss,105852652.0,Sport,105852647.0,5.7,450.0,5.0,3.1,233.0,"The First Kiss is a creatively constructed, fully bolted multi-pitch route tucked off in the northern most reaches of the park.  The route has five pitches but, by linking the first two pitches, it can be done in four (but not recommended).  All anchor stations have two bolts. Be aware that due to the locations of the anchor stations communication can be challenging - especially if there is a breeze blowing and/or if you've linked the first two pitches - and rope drag can be a problem on much of the route.    The first pitch (5.7) follows a generous collection of bolts up in a fairly straight line past a single high step crux to a fairly comfortable, semi-hanging belay station.    Pitch two (5.6) continues up an interesting blocky face and on a short arete to an excellent wide belay balcony with a sweet view of the north face of Monkey Face and the Cascade mountains to the west.    Note: if you chose to link pitches one and two be sure to attempt to use standard length runners at appropriate bolts to minimize rope drag.  However, if you link these pitches, no matter how skillfully you might long runner and/or skip bolts you will experience some rope drag.    Pitch three heads horizontally north slightly down for about 40 feet along a ramp and then turns modestly up left another 40 feet to a fun crux move (5.5) just before the belay station. Plan on substantial rope drag on this nearly horizontal and rounded traverse pitch.    Pitch four (5.5) traverses up and left into and then up and out of a mossy bowl via a short and fun blocky arete.  A short traverse left after the arete leads to a belay station atop a small bolder at the base of an orange-colored, pothole filled wall.    Pitch five (5.7) heads straight up the wall passing a short left-facing book and then continuing up another fun wall to the finishing anchors. There are two sets of anchor bolts at the top of the climb - the upper set are recommended.    Descent:   It is recommended that you do not attempt to rappel this wandering route.

Wide edge moves lead to a tricky overhung finish on pockets and edges just before the anchors.","{107071499: 4, 106026309: 4, 107902567: 4, 109823981: 4, 105798761: 4, 200159225: 4, 200208367: 4, 112128138: 4, 200360337: 4, 112550809: 4, 200118368: 4, 112270406: 4, 107394785: 4, 107535611: 3, 106785663: 3, 105898385: 3, 106265516: 3, 106378922: 3, 106496497: 3, 106776757: 3, 106477440: 3, 108163249: 3, 106780021: 3, 107563809: 3, 107847782: 3, 107890277: 3, 108188495: 3, 107096922: 3, 107576018: 3, 108958835: 3, 107913373: 3, 106200072: 3, 106542095: 3, 108170319: 3, 106975561: 3, 107938599: 3, 107575405: 3, 107805637: 3, 109258388: 3, 111680549: 3, 107254662: 3, 111319153: 3, 109284392: 3, 111024217: 3, 107070156: 3, 111833511: 3, 112323726: 3, 108052663: 3, 200053620: 3, 111949240: 3, 107116940: 3, 108243919: 3, 200034040: 3, 113166977: 3, 107919778: 3, 200091979: 3, 111810534: 3, 111465523: 3, 107654077: 3, 111718218: 3, 200170248: 3, 110669338: 3, 106838734: 3, 200075560: 3, 7091916: 3, 111948265: 3, 200238113: 3, 108383947: 3, 106102182: 3, 200371892: 3, 113164188: 3, 107734618: 3, 200188254: 3, 110152429: 3, 110298630: 3, 200453518: 3, 112096766: 3, 200358827: 3, 110202135: 3, 200128462: 3, 110750765: 3, 200251132: 3, 112386569: 3, 200190782: 3, 200064605: 3, 200117475: 3, 200273632: 3, 200641473: 3, 200415259: 3, 200418610: 3, 109610600: 3, 200449836: 3, 200471696: 3, 200246689: 3, 105794408: 2, 105809872: 2, 10368: 2, 105926493: 2, 106494476: 2, 107083009: 2, 105797754: 2, 106034152: 2, 106203442: 2, 105973110: 2, 105982463: 2, 106047496: 2, 106718311: 2, 106347294: 2, 10382: 2, 107370614: 2, 108095935: 2, 105873502: 2, 108208572: 2, 106107186: 2, 107664518: 2, 108217198: 2, 109419072: 2, 108282289: 2, 109308102: 2, 109208153: 2, 107974182: 2, 105797645: 2, 108981462: 2, 108055813: 2, 109424881: 2, 108836524: 2, 107616614: 2, 108611179: 2, 107435323: 2, 107603653: 2, 108412656: 2, 111185402: 2, 112106313: 2, 107000115: 2, 109241266: 2, 110752881: 2, 200044470: 2, 109969730: 2, 111267403: 2, 112508959: 2, 110326550: 2, 111839173: 2, 111013504: 2, 11591: 2, 108693865: 2, 106870964: 2, 107829049: 2, 108254193: 2, 200072147: 2, 110225880: 2, 106973304: 2, 112320035: 2, 110126271: 2, 200148448: 2, 111197583: 2, 110704332: 2, 111992286: 2, 200045309: 2, 112342766: 2, 10544: 2, 200261925: 2, 110735352: 2, 109280306: 2, 107870857: 2, 113478649: 2, 7028984: 2, 200299394: 2, 200418141: 2, 200415213: 2, 111525178: 2, 107545559: 2, 200594520: 2, 109711410: 2, 200487761: 2, 200356179: 2, 200219398: 2, 200693652: 2, 200242752: 2, 107696894: 2, 200580270: 2, 106858993: 1, 15023: 1, 106851992: 1, 108197152: 1, 106761693: 1, 109527528: 1, 110400277: 1, 108236363: 1}"
Dirty Pinkos,108347741.0,Sport,105790347.0,5.9+,0.0,4.0,3.4,235.0,"Original information was sent to SmithRock.com from Ted Stahl and was edited by Mike Volk: Mike Reusse and I completed the climb [Dirty Pinkos] last summer but were hesitant to post until it was cleaned further. I think it is a great adventure route. Similar in rock quality to ""Wherever I May Roam"" when it was first put up. The crux of the route is on the second pitch. The third pitch is a 120' traverse and goes at 5.8. Leader and follower need to be strong on 5.8. The fourth pitch is slabby 5.5 to a vertical 5.8 move getting off the climb.  Link to the topo: web.archive.org/web/2015090…  1st Pitch - Thin moves at the start leads to fun slab climbing up the outside corner next to the start of Super Slab. Use the anchors for SS or Animal Farm.  2nd Pitch- Strait up from the SS anchors, clip a bolt and head up through some blocks and on to the face. Follow the bolt line up to a set of chains.  3rd Pitch-Traverse right across a cool gully filled with neon lichen and up to a ledge with two bolts. Airy and fun.  4th Pitch- Follow the bolt line up the slab to a steep finish. This pitch has the most loose rock. You could probably finish via Gulag Archipelago as well. Don't use the gully as rockfall would be very dangerous for people at the base.  Walk off or you might be able to rappel one of the other routes near by  The climb is mostly solid and will clean up nicely once its seen more ascents.","{108255529: 4, 108539747: 4, 109308102: 4, 109284392: 4, 110585520: 4, 110731835: 4, 109008262: 4, 106477440: 4, 108338368: 4, 112149998: 4, 108601850: 4, 111652729: 4, 110332758: 4, 112360598: 4, 107734618: 4, 200034040: 4, 112521589: 4, 108243919: 4, 107717413: 4, 107768989: 4, 107847782: 4, 112418846: 4, 108254193: 4, 109052547: 4, 200091979: 4, 105989110: 4, 109093465: 4, 200064270: 4, 107313238: 4, 200159225: 4, 109378378: 4, 106858993: 4, 108383947: 4, 110693137: 4, 200219398: 4, 200197123: 4, 200202255: 4, 200070835: 4, 112412206: 4, 200044470: 4, 107780599: 4, 107101448: 4, 200136802: 4, 200241582: 4, 108981414: 4, 111112991: 4, 106652667: 4, 112083393: 4, 200269405: 4, 111695941: 4, 200354948: 4, 200248588: 4, 110302941: 4, 107654077: 4, 109463002: 4, 110853033: 4, 200085134: 4, 112224361: 4, 200338416: 4, 109649642: 4, 108518318: 4, 200375511: 4, 200259204: 4, 112468948: 4, 111405588: 4, 109280306: 4, 200188254: 4, 110965253: 4, 110152429: 4, 110298630: 4, 200453435: 4, 107184020: 4, 112386169: 4, 200275251: 4, 111885672: 4, 200102737: 4, 112406421: 4, 200299394: 4, 200414997: 4, 110177984: 4, 200481504: 4, 200400897: 4, 111371028: 4, 107545559: 4, 108519575: 4, 200482368: 4, 200072218: 4, 7101227: 4, 200594520: 4, 111049791: 4, 107680416: 4, 109468689: 4, 111999314: 4, 200471696: 4, 111825461: 4, 200488954: 4, 200667635: 4, 200694013: 4, 200650857: 4, 111993695: 4, 200212139: 4, 200094037: 4, 107764168: 4, 200064811: 4, 105800790: 4, 200451464: 4, 200602987: 4, 200539432: 4, 200893723: 4, 200845522: 4, 109610600: 4, 200251553: 4, 200754374: 4, 112498380: 4, 200526561: 4, 110575195: 4, 200166628: 4, 200774409: 4, 200528462: 4, 106286658: 3, 106892871: 3, 106445962: 3, 106071538: 3, 105797645: 3, 108975346: 3, 109285549: 3, 111118559: 3, 110729233: 3, 108756654: 3, 110206802: 3, 106399334: 3, 109624383: 3, 109199215: 3, 111644949: 3, 109258734: 3, 111833511: 3, 109443890: 3, 108759454: 3, 107000115: 3, 109402210: 3, 108555581: 3, 106022487: 3, 111589822: 3, 107682818: 3, 110937405: 3, 111849524: 3, 111144995: 3, 112106313: 3, 111822624: 3, 111454181: 3, 112250778: 3, 111583162: 3, 110797288: 3, 110904912: 3, 106870964: 3, 106662993: 3, 112856061: 3, 112074286: 3, 200154932: 3, 112530876: 3, 110883466: 3, 112071682: 3, 111465523: 3, 108226990: 3, 110669338: 3, 112128138: 3, 107083315: 3, 110720228: 3, 111992286: 3, 107930690: 3, 110320894: 3, 107342926: 3, 200333031: 3, 200122090: 3, 109033018: 3, 111680549: 3, 112823201: 3, 112846385: 3, 200206184: 3, 108052663: 3, 200170248: 3, 200386796: 3, 200103445: 3, 111853279: 3, 112086258: 3, 109546101: 3, 112511507: 3, 112091331: 3, 200235611: 3, 111671426: 3, 108689582: 3, 200245420: 3, 110457315: 3, 105801073: 3, 200415213: 3, 200421245: 3, 200056611: 3, 112793085: 3, 107475857: 3, 7091916: 3, 200385496: 3, 112006024: 3, 200595188: 3, 110224429: 3, 7107319: 3, 200288342: 3, 200453266: 3, 110997740: 3, 113164188: 3, 200199038: 3, 111977638: 3, 200166625: 3, 105808624: 3, 200814823: 3, 107531373: 3, 110752881: 3, 200280344: 3, 107468759: 2, 111185402: 2, 110396213: 2, 106662918: 2, 200075560: 2, 110967113: 2, 200103195: 2, 108285679: 2, 107297910: 2, 109711410: 2, 106440579: 2, 111737693: 2, 200415259: 2, 106107186: 1, 107737478: 1, 200280020: 1, 200216421: 1}"

The rock appears atrocious at first, but with good stemming and jamming technique most of the choss is avoidable, and becomes cleaner higher up.    P1: Start up the loose corner, using both cracks to stem around a bulge. Continue on better rock with multiple cracks in the corner to a section of easier rock, to a belay around the corner to the right.    P2: Follow wide cracks up the right-facing corner. The rock is great on this pitch but still has some lichen. Belay at the top of the corner on a large shelf.

Personally, I like this route because it gives you the opportunity to climb Orgasmaphoria.  Together, they make for a fun lazy afternoon on a long route with good rock, position, and bolts.  By itself, I'd say that you could do these exact moves on any of fifty other routes at Smith.  For those uninitiated to Smith, or who never tire of rounded, technical tuff edges, this won't be a problem.    Again, as long as you are doing this one, you should finish with the Orgasmaphoria pitch above.

Just like the adventurous spirit of ol' Hank dog, this route by nature has an adventurous quality, sitting so high up on the wall. This route should be climbed and belayed from the ledge above. While lowering the climber back to the ledge, having them either tether in while lowering or lassoing the rope out to the dangling climber works well. It's also wise for the belayer to have a longer tether fed out connecting them to the wall while belaying. A short connection using a standard PAS or single sling will result in a hard catch for the climber and an awkward catch for the belayer.  Start out traversing the big ledge on good edged crimps to the first bolt. After clipping the second bolt, unclip the first bolt. Keep clipping the next bolt and unclipping the last bolt through to bolt 4. This ensures a clean line runs from you to the belayer. Make a traverse working into a jug flake system. Clip bolts 5 and 6 from the jugs. From here, you will quickly work into the steepest section of the overhang. Keep working up the flake system until it ends, then being met with some of the slickest hand holds at Smith. Work onto a rail and make the tough clip.

Talk to anyone who frequents Smith and enjoys multipitch climbing and they'll tell you that they want to do it someday.So go do it!Honestly, it's really not that bad. This route's reputation for being runout is entirely untrue and it's reputation for being choss is only a little bit true. While there are certainly creaky, flaky holds, it's well protected and most(!) of the hard climbing is on excellent stone. That being said, many of the belays are directly in the leader's line of fire, so bring a helmet.P1: 5.6-10a Climb any of the excellent sport routes of the Monument Base Area to the rightmost anchor.P2: 5.9 Step right and then up to gain an obvious left-facing corner. The flakes in the corner sound hollow, but you're clipping shiny bolts. Hand traverse left (good gear) to two separate anchors. Of the two, we used the left one, but I'd recommend the right. (it's just a touch further out from under the line of fire and is in better rock) Pitches 1 and 2 are easily linked.P3: ""5.11-"" (to quote the Watts guide) I’d peg it more around 11+. This is where things start getting interesting. Work up and left to a distinct crux at an asca bolt out left.  Execute a thin, off-balance sequence on sidepulls and edges to a rail up and left and then work back right to another asca bolt higher up.  If you clip either of the two bolts to the right, (before the aforementioned 2nd asca bolt, more in line with the original bolt ladder) make sure to use long slings.  Once established in the chimney, wade through some easy choss until just below an old, manky anchor.  From here either continue left up the original line of terrible old bolts in choss (not recommended, 9+/10-) or step right to ledge with a less old anchor., but don't stop and belay.  Instead climb up much better rock just left of a blunt arete clipping more new asca bolts before running it out on easy ground to the top.  (recommended, 10-)P4 5.12- Moderate climbing up less than perfect rock past more ancient bolts (easily backed up with gear and newer bolts) spits you off at a nice stance below a steep swath of vastly better rock. Gymnastic and balancy moves on some booming flakes deposit you at the crux. After pulling through the difficulties onto the ledge, catch your breath (don't belay) and climb further up and right clipping shiny new bolts as you pull exciting moves in one of Smith's more airy positions. Belay at either of the anchors at the base of the Tombstone crack. (can't miss it)P5: 5.10+ Pull a thin face move to gain the start of the splitter. It starts as fingers and gradually widens up to hands. Power through the fingers/off-fingers down low and savor the amazing (but kind of sharp) jamming above. Belay at a large, obvious ledge.P6: 5.6 Climb up and left following an obvious weakness that will ultimately corkscrew up to the summit. Watch out for rope drag.Descent: The whole route rappels easily. Anchors are down and east of the summit. We used two ropes, but there are rumors of a single 70 being sufficient. I bet you could make this work (certainly with trickery) but can't be sure, not having actually done it. Alternatively, scramble and walk back (north) to the grass and descend the large gully to the west between the Monument and Puddy's Tower.

The first pitch, beginning at the Juniper snag, is mostly low angle face climbing that meanders up the back side of the buttress.  Follow the line of weakness, and you'll be fine.  Expect no protection.   The route angle will flatten out, and you will find yourself at the bottom of a short section of exposed vertical rock.     With your left leg hanging over the abyss, find the solution jug, and mantle your way to another flat section, which seems to pass over a tunnel through the rock (though it's hard to tell from the top).  [Note: this is not mentioned in the Watts book- there is probably an easier line, but this way looked really nice].   From there, follow the line of least resistance to the awesome spire summit, where you will find rap anchors.     For me, the first pitch was reminiscent of the final pitch of the Traveller's Buttress at Lover's Leap: long, exposed, with solid knobs and edges. Pass through or over tunnels, around corners, and enjoy the creative routefinding in truly three dimensional terrain on both this and the adjacent Cave Route (South Buttress is much better, I think).     Most pleasant is the varied, somewhat athletic approach, incredible views of the sisters, broken top, and bachelor, an awesome summit, and all with no one around.  Dreamy.

P1 - 5.8 - Follow the boltline atop the block, up and to anchors.    P2 - 5.7 - Step out and left and follow bolts to the top, or step right 5.4 and follow bolts to the top.    Downclimb off the north end of the mudpile to a single bolt belay.     P3 - 5.7R - Continue traversing towards Mini Half dome, clip one bolt and make one harder move onto the top of the thing next to Mini Half Dome. There is one more bolt here you can clip. Now either stem or jump the gap to Mini HD. Belay from bolt anchor. Easy runouts.     Rappel off the north side of Mini HD.     P4 - 5.5R/X - This is a long 200ft pitch, with runouts on 5.4 climbing. Follow the west face route of Brogan spire. Immediatly clip one bolt and make the hardest move of the pitch. The follow the easiest line, as far as you can make it to a double bolt belay atop the huge ledge. Oppritunity exists for akward gear placements, tho if you fell at some points you could go a long way. (rated X by Watts)    P5 - 5.5R - The bird shit pitch! Head straight up placeing a few peices before running it out into the bird shit. Mantle to the top through the bird shit.     Rappel north into the notch move belay to double bolted belay atop original P2 of the cave route.    P6 - 5.4R - Head north towards the tail, cut left accross an akward ledge to the north side of the tail, then clip a bolt and head to anchors below the summit. Belay your partner to the top then have him down climb and lead the next pitch. Rotten rock on this pitch.    P7 - 5.5 - For the seconds sake (if you dont moove the belay) it is best to only clip the last of the 3 bolts. Clipping the first two might create some akward rope drag and could create a nasty fall for the second when downclimbing from the anchor. Either way follow the path of three bolts up good rock to anchor atop the opossum.     Either do a double rope rappel or...    P8 - 5.1R - Traverse along the ridge to an old anchor with slings.

It probably took me 20 tries just to figure out how to step off of the pillar and easily double that to piece together the rest of the crux sequences.  After about twenty feet the crack starts to open up to occasional first digit mono locks interspersed with crimps. While this is definitely easier than the crux, it's far from easy and you want to dial it in well for the red point. Shortly thereafter it opens up to fingers-in-a-corner stemming more typical of the established lines at Trout. This feels easy while you're working it, but can be desperate on the go.  Just before the corner ends and jugs start to appear, the crack slams shut again and you have to execute one more technical stemming crux that revolves around a key left foot.

In my time spent on this climb, I came up with three options for climbing this route:    Option #1- Make a few easy moves and clip the first bolt. From here, move leftwards towards the arete and climb the face and arete utilizing crimps and sidepulls with your right hand and the arete with your left. This line actually seems the most natural and logical and the second clip is fairly easy to make. After reaching the good edges above the second bolt, move right and up, finishing direct. This feels like low end 5.12 to me.     Option #2- Make a few easy moves and clip the first bolt. From here, head up and right on progressively worsening crimps to a hard lockoff to a decent crimp (crux). Match this crimp and move left to a bad gaston pocket. Find a foot, make a tricky move to another pocket with the right and on to the good edges with the left. Clip the second bolt and continue upwards on large holds to the chains. There is some groundfall potential on this one as it is easiest/best to clip the second bolt after reaching the good hold above it. This feels like mid to hard 5.12 to me.    Option #3- This could be the intended line, but it climbs somewhat contrived. Start the same as the other options. After reaching the first bolt, climb directly (just right of the bolt line) utilizing a few mighty small crimps and a gaston or two. The crux involves deadpointing to a decent crimp with the right while not losing contact with the left. There is also groundfall potential on this option as clipping the second bolt before reaching the good edges is nearly impossible. This feels more like low end 5.13 to me.

Pitch 1 - There are four variations for this first pitch. Two go at 5.8 and two at 5.6 leading to bolted anchors just left of a small tree.     Pitch 2 - From here, route finding can be tricky. Move up above the tree onto a slab under a small roof and traverse across the slab. Climb up a short bulge directly after the slab and continue moving right. look for two pitons right above you as there are no good placement options here. After clipping the piton, look right and slightly down for anchors about fifteen feet right. there isn't really any pro across this section but the climbing isn't to bad either.     Pitch 3 - Follow the path of least resistance up and right about 20 feet past a small tree and onto an arete with bolts looming above on an overhang. look around the corner and you will see a line of bolts and pitons traversing a slightly overhung wall. This section is the crux of the climb and is stiff for the 10a grade. continue traversing right to a bunch of shrubs and a medium sized tree where you will find an anchor badly in need of some love. The anchor is pretty rusted but does have one saving grace three quarter inch bolt from the nineties.     Plan on bringing webbing if you want to rap to the ground via a single eighty foot rap. Otherwise, you can climb up the poison oak infested hillside via thirty feet of fourth class terrain to a large tree(recommended belay for this section). Walk off.

This route is very difficult to figure out on the onsight attempt, due to a surplus of unnecessary holds and very low friction to help you pop off.  Once wired, it feels rather easy for the grade due to its brevity, particularly if you are tall.  Makes for a logical, direct start to the route Critical Mass above it.","{200805505: 4, 200118368: 4, 110853033: 4, 106601971: 4, 113258942: 4, 108457784: 3, 200168169: 3, 107342926: 3, 200161779: 3, 109613746: 3, 107317697: 3, 109559136: 3, 200235784: 3, 111217937: 3, 111700144: 3, 112250400: 3, 200199939: 3, 112323726: 3, 200044470: 3, 7091916: 3, 111024305: 3, 108279952: 3, 106404256: 3, 108994382: 3, 200483354: 3, 106006184: 3, 106477440: 3, 112400297: 3, 106776757: 3, 200120443: 3, 106761693: 3, 200304827: 3, 200268417: 3, 106109031: 3, 200052501: 3, 200615379: 3, 109474377: 2, 107837626: 2, 110997740: 2, 200216421: 2, 200244913: 2, 107085584: 2, 111190382: 2, 105952525: 2, 112413521: 2, 111801659: 2, 200376059: 2, 109044944: 2, 106149746: 2, 108295148: 2, 105887100: 2, 107158937: 2, 106918913: 2, 106695587: 2, 105946742: 2, 106046804: 2, 106389004: 2, 106727559: 2, 105982463: 2, 106365141: 2, 106230701: 2, 105873502: 2, 107096922: 2, 110268695: 2, 109213362: 2, 110206802: 2, 108412656: 2, 108122674: 2, 111343639: 2, 108367150: 2, 108778861: 2, 111781359: 2, 108036385: 2, 108230515: 1, 112161641: 1, 200064413: 1, 106980973: 1, 111092520: 1, 200200801: 1}"

I managed to send it on 7/15/2018 and called it ""King Louie"" I will estimate the grade at about 5.12d. The best approach to this route is through Forced March, by skipping every other clip or clipping/unclipping bolts. Make sure to use an extended sling at the anchors at the start of the route, passed the Forced March anchors (make sure to unclip these anchors, or rope drag could be bad.) The climb can be divided in 3 sections: first climb a tricky dihedral for 2 bolts. Clipping the second bolt can be a bit reachy for short people. You will have to trust your feet through dihedral stemming to make it to the better holds. After the dihedral, you will traverse to the right under a small roof, on better holds, before starting the second section of powerful undercling moves for another 2 bolts. You will get a good shake at the point where this route splits from Jungle Boogie. The route up to that point is probably around 5.12a. Make sure you feel fresh and rested before continuing the route as it will get much harder. The last section is moving left and up on the final 2 bolts. The climbing feels like a tough V6/V7 boulder problem. The last few moves to the anchors are much easier but due to the insecure position could get you if you are pumped.

There are currently 5 distinct and separate moderate trad routes here, and 3 more slight variations of the 5. They all go between 5.8 and 5.10. Only 2 of them have names. On the far left, as you start up the 4th class which goes to the top, is the obvious crack ""Corona Glass Houses"", 5.10- named by Bryan Schmidt after he and I did the FA. The other routes it's nice to have a 70M rope. I noticed that my blue Mammut 60m JUST reached the deck on the right side, then came back a year later and the identical rope ends were over 15' short one each end! (Lots of use in that rope in a year, water and washing will shirk them that much) So watch your rope ends!    The 2nd line is slightly down the hill and starts just left of the fir tree. It can be finished 2 ways. Left @ slightly over the 1/2 way mark into a wide crack (#7 or 8 hex is bomber at the start of the wide stuff)- or just continue straight up the obvious crack, still a bit dirty but getting cleaner - and harder. After a Labrador sized foothold block pulled off near the top, but it goes and finishes at bolts.     The 2nd named line is immediately to the right of the big fir tree at the base which ascends an intermittent crack up and slightly right and is named ""The Plum"" @ 5.9 off the ground then easing.     The crack on the right of the Buttress was originally rope-soloed by me FA off the Maple tree 25 feet up off the deck, which is also the traditional start to Dream Weaver, the classic 5.9 Mike Pajunas route. My route starts @ 5 feet left of Mikes route. Later the line below was cleaned off and added so Dream Weaver can finally be done ground up as well. Like all of the routes on the Buttress, that start has evolved: from originally grabbing a clump of sword ferns, then grabbing a nice rock hold revealed when the Sword fern finally got pulled off, to now a difficult start and possibly the crux for the 2 routes on the right when the nice hold got yanked off.      More so than most quarry lines, this area still has some significant potential for injury and grade changing with loose blocks becoming more so as they frost heave over the years, so keep a wary eye out and belay near/behind the big Douglas Fir tree or the overhang mentally prepared to duck out of the way no matter if leading or following.  If you are leading, be aware that the loose nature of the area may mean that your perfect looking protection may pull right out as that huge block simply shifts when you fall. So overprotection is encouraged, and if your partner grief's you out over how slow you're going, you know which finger to utilize to non-verbally explain your position and your thoughts:-) There had been a perfect fingercrack in the upper part of the middle route which simply disappeared when the 300 + lb block fell off, making that route significantly more difficult.     Various other folks have assisted as well cleaning and belaying: Ujhan Davvison, Ron Kirby , Stan Miller, Jim Robinson (who named the location) and a few folks who I just rounded up or who showed up and I didn't know their names.

Peregrine Traverse,111000177.0,Trad,111000151.0,5.7,1500.0,9.0,3.5,31.0,"Fun traverse with excellent views, if you don't mind somewhat sparse protection.  Pitch 1: Scramble low 5th class ridge up to tree.  Pitch 2: Climb diagonally up and left, following a few bolts to bolted anchor just to the right of tree (5.7). Recommendation (go): to reduce drag, as you come to the corner in the middle of P1 do not clip into the top anchor of Sinister Footwear.  Pitch 3: Climb slab with 3 bolts to your right (5.7), or go scramble straight up and place your own pro (5.0). For both options, scramble along ledges to the only small tree at the base of Lunch Rock. Please note, you may not be able to hear each other from this location.  Pitch 4: Traverse about 40 feet, clipping anchors for another route and the two other bolts along the way. Then downclimb 10 feet into saddle, then go up left side of ridge on the other side of the saddle. About 20 feet up there are options for pro. Another 10-15 about that you'll find bolted anchors. (5.6). Option (go): place a #3 cam after leaving the saddle, below belay slab.  Pitch 5: Climb straight up 10 feet to the only bolt on this pitch. Continue through short wide crack (#3 or #4 cam). Continue scrambling your way until you see two small trees, at which you'll find two bolt anchor (5.7). Note (go): once on top of the short wide crack, looking off to the right (E) you'll see top anchors & chains for Maltese Falcon (P3) left variation. This route has been upgraded with rap chains.  Pitch 6: Scramble on left side of ridge clipping two bolts along the way. Continue to bolted anchors at wide crack about 20 feet above a douglas fir. Note (go): this section is easily supplemented with a variety of cam sizes.  Pitch 7: Scramble up wide crack into gap with a narrow ridge ahead of you. Scramble up narrow ridge, clipping one bolt on the way. Continue on the ridge. Soon you'll see belay anchors on your left, and anchors and register for Black Magic on your right. You are now at the top of Black Magic.  You could probably use either set of anchors, but I used the anchors on the left (West side). (5.4)  Pitch 8: From the west (left anchors), look 15 feet in front of you on left side and locate the climbing register & top anchors for Back Magic. DON'T Rappel about 40 feet to a ledge from the rotten tree as some are doing (go). Instead follow the ridge line (easterly) to its end and down climb 10 feet to a trail and ledge that contours into the saddle to the left (looking down). The down climb (class 4) is easily protected with a #3 or #4 cam. From the saddle, Scramble northward on easy but exposed terrain about 30 feet. Downclimb easy fourth class for 10 feet to another ledge at base of a chimney, or set up a trad anchor and belay your partner down.  Pitch 9: Climb chimney. About 20 feet up chimney you'll find places for pro. Continue up right side, and gaining top of ridge. Use small tree for pro. Continue on narrow ridge for 20 feet (no further pro) to two bolted anchors. May be difficult to hear each other at this point. (5.5).  Descent: Complete the climb by locating the rap anchors 3 feet to your right, and rapping to the base of the large tree. Do not rap past the tree unless you want to do some extra scrambling / forest navigation. From the base of the tree follow the scramble trail horizontally, not down, and up into the trees until you find the Acker Rock Lookout. Follow the Lookout trail .25 as it switchbacks down to NF-950, and then 1 mi on NF-950 to the gate where you started.","{200528462: 4, 200416915: 4, 200459286: 4, 200137623: 4, 108285679: 4, 200374160: 4, 200075584: 4, 200517203: 4, 107067743: 4, 200531236: 4, 200501495: 4, 106365779: 4, 200601567: 4, 111547589: 4, 112426189: 4, 107790130: 4, 200189310: 4, 111949398: 4, 108159726: 4, 200338416: 3, 110731835: 3, 111851326: 3, 7047253: 3, 200180152: 3, 200551092: 3, 200153882: 3, 111137975: 3, 108383947: 3, 200171880: 2, 15023: 2, 106776757: 2}"

Wizard Tower,115124333.0,Sport,111000151.0,5.7,0.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,"Wizards Tower is a moderate route that offers an exposed feeling, diversity in movement and consistent climbing during the final pitch up the feature. The route consists of 3 pitches, with most of the actual climbing in the final one. The climb ends at a pinnacle summit, and offers sweeping views of the southern skyline. There is a lot of the endemic buckwheat on this route, so please avoid stepping on it. Pitch 1- 35' (5.8) Also known as the waterfall route, a short climb follows the winter runoff on a small vertical face to a bowl at the bottom of the main rock face. This route is also used to access Black Magic. Since this section of rock gets runoff from the rock above, there is a lot of moss and other organic matter growing on the route. Make sure to avoid rope drag on the trees. Pitch 2- 120' This ""pitch"" is really just an access scramble to the actual tower. You can bushwhack through the bottom of the bowl, or climb the moss garden closer to the edge. Aim for the right side of the tower past the trees where a two bolt anchor rests at the base of the rock. There are no bolts on this pitch. Pitch 3- 150' (5.7) This pitch offers consistent climbing at the grade, as the route winds over the bulges on the Southeast face. With a mix of jugs and slab, the exposure increases exponentially during the route all the way to the summit. Bolts are placed when climbing is consistent, but expect runouts on easier terrain. Alpine draws can be nice to reduce rope drag.Descent- Rappel about 30' off the East face (backside) of the tower, aiming for the large fir tree below. From here, you can hike uphill towards the backside of the rock, where a small ledge feeds into the hillside.

Pat named that route Discipline Crack.  Alan Watts and Tom Rogers top roped this same crack but kept their feet to the right of Dirty Crack to up the difficulty to 12c.

Worthy of a visit from anyone up to the challenge, Barad Dur is inarguably one of the classiest of our Northwestern adventure climbs. Over the course of eight pitches of mostly excellent rock climbing, a combination of moderate face and crack climbing, plenty of bolts, and a few bold, steep, awesome crux pitches lead you through an audacious series of roofs and up to the top of Wolf Rock. Expect to run it out on easy terrain, but to be well-protected, often by bolts, at all of the route's cruxes.

P1: Follow a line of well-spaced bolts on dark rock up to a bolted belay. 25m (5.9)     P2: Climb up and right past bolts until you can climb a somewhat loose & manky right-facing corner to another bolted belay. 25m (5.9)     Note: P1 & P2 can be linked with a 60m rope.     P3: Climb up past two bolts and trend slightly right along the cleanest rock to a third bolt. From here traverse up and left along ledges placing gear as necessary until reaching another bolted belay on a small ledge. 35m (5.8)     P4: Head up and right on easy climbing (5.4) along a low-angled ramp. Follow the ramp to a left-facing corner, and climb the corner until you can traverse left under a roof. Head left and then up to a belay stance with some unique bolt hangers. 40m (5.9)     P5. Head right and traverse past the obvious line of bolts and around the tricky corner, then up to a cramped, semi-hanging belay on your right. 15m (5.10d)     P6. Climb straight up passing bolts to the crux move over a roof. Make a strenuous mantle onto the sloping shelf on your right. From there, make an airy traverse out right around the corner and up to another bolted belay. 25m (5.11b)     P7: Head up and left on easy but sparsely protected terrain passing a two bolt anchor and following the path of least resistance towards the skyline ridge. 60m (5.4)     P8: Continue up on low-5th and 4th-class terrain until the technical climbing eases to scrambling. 60m (5.2)  Continue scrambling up and left following a narrow but exposed and loose ridge until you can eventually gain the summit pinnacle.     Descent: From the summit, trend west/southwest along the ridgeline following a faint trail when possible until you can gain the Southwest Gully descent. A mix of grassy hillsides and 3rd-4th class down-climbing in a water groove will lead down the drainage until it is possible to exit onto a climber's path on your left. Follow the path back to the road.","{106918913: 4, 200168169: 4, 110693137: 4, 200185755: 4, 111190382: 4, 108778861: 4, 105958777: 4, 200181593: 4, 200268793: 4, 200216421: 4, 107088550: 4, 200212139: 4, 108751329: 4, 106973304: 4, 108294324: 4, 15023: 4, 106231822: 4, 106467532: 4, 107715396: 4, 106134676: 4, 110547057: 4, 109613746: 4, 107603653: 3, 108308307: 3, 107183802: 3, 106788819: 3, 105801073: 3, 105873502: 3, 108230515: 3, 110807723: 3, 109285549: 3, 107287077: 2, 109206113: 1}"

Extend or skip the bolt at the miniature ""platform"" that marks the transition to overhang to avoid doglegging the rope. Now proceed up another ~75 feet which slowly overhangs more the further you go.  I enjoyed this route immensely because I felt that nearly all of the movement flowed very well, with few awkward moments. Cerberus is a great sustained endurance test; The hardest move is perhaps .10a/b, and in the final five bolts so is the easiest. Look forward to big neutral edges, smaller incuts, and leaning back on phat pinchy slopers, all made of Wolf's wonderful sticky andesite. When you finally throw your arms onto the finish ledge, look down at the overhang that snuck up on you!  The anchor-to-ledge distance for a free hanging rope is approximately 38 meters. A single 70 will not reach. Plan accordingly. Wear a helmet: The upper topography of Wolf directs rockfall from roughly a million square feet of alpine choss toward this particular area.

In its current condition it was surely a death route, not attracting any repeats other than Wayne him self. Now I normally wouldn't be too into fully retro bolting old routes but with the blessing of the first ascensionist, being his idea it seemed like a must do. Not even knowing and still not knowing where the actual route went made it basically a first ascent in its own right. So we created the eight pitch 5.9 Morgul Vale aka Gigantor V2.0.""    The P2 anchor sits atop a giant ledge. Right of MV is Ian's Route which goes to the same P2 anchor. Left (on the start ledge's hump) is Gigantor which provides a scary runout path to same.    The Morgul Vale:   P1: 5.8, 6 bolts + belay bolt. Scramble up the left of the start ledge & around a hump to the belay bolt. [The left bolt hanger is upside down as of 6/3]   P2: 5.7, 4 bolts. Progressively wider-spaced bolts protect easier moves en route to the next ledge system. Pass the 1st anchor going up and right and you'll be directly under the P3 start.   P3: 5.9+, 7 bolts. The technical crux; Right hand clips are the order of the day (much harder, and very much dirtier, otherwise).   P4: 5.7, 7 bolts. An enjoyable, easy, and well bolted pitch.   --- The climbing gets more alpine above here   P5: 5.7, 3 bolts. Some 20 feet up, bolts with black hangers appear. After the third eases your nerves, shuffle left. A trad placement before one last nontrivial move will ease nerves.   P6: 5.8, 6 bolts. Your choice, up over or around under the boulder. Left, then up. Long slings help with drag. It is easy to miss the P6 anchor if you don't already know where it is. If you're well past the last clip, go right onto the ""meadow"" and look back for it. Don't keep going, you can't reach the P7 anchor from P5 even with a 70.   --- Original Morgul Vale line   P7a: 4th class/5.4, 1 bolt. Clamber up a series of big shoulders and onto a low-angle slab. Carefully pick your way toward the unmistakable U-shaped ramp/chute, unprotected. One bolt at the ramp entrance eases nerves (and redirects the rope) for a few 5.easy moves before the anchor. If you only have 1 rope, this is a point of no return (P7a is 150' long).   P8a: 5.7?, gear + natural. Trad placements are possible in the left crack (We used smaller cams & stoppers). The angle is low but the climbing is delicate and the edges friable. Escape out of the trench up to the hillside by the scrawny tree and scramble to a belay at a large tree. This pitch rains fist-size missiles when the leader leaves the channel.    From the lower tree anchor, scramble to a group of trees (incl a large white one), rope optional. Unrope and enjoy carefully clambering over person-sized blocks with excellent friction (but do avoid pulling any of them out...). At the lower summit, there is an anchor with two fatty hangars; This is for climbers scrambling up from the new Morgul Vale / Barad Dur.    After taking in the view, begin scrambling left (away from the river) along the ridge towards the true summit and the walkoff (see descent / descent topo below)   --- New Morgul Vale line   There is now a bolted line that ends at the same point as Barad Dur. I suppose this ""Morgul Vale 2.0"".    ""P7b:"" Walk 50 feet over an inclined meadow towards the ampitheater and find bolts at the first headwall.   P8b: 5.6, 3 bolts: A brief jaunt over the first wall to a big ledge introduces the style of the remainder of the climb: Big moves over alternate low-angle slab and steep faces.   P9b: 5.8, 7(?) bolts: A fun encounter with a dihedral leads to a crux finding holds and manteling onto a deluxe size belay ledge.   P10b: 5.8, 6(?) bolts: More block crawling includes a brief encounter with a harder corner and tops out at the northeast corner of Wolf.    Links with a 70: P1+2, P3+4 barely (length ~68m), P5+6 (boat anchor drag). P8b+P9b or P9b+P10b.    The new line is rappellable all the way back down. Trying to get from P8b start, over the side notch, back directly to the start of P6, is tempting but I don't think a single 70 will reach.    To summit: Traverse the summit ridge towards an intimidating rise ahead. A brief stint of easy but poorly protected 5th class climbing on crap rock goes up the right side skyline. Proceed with walkoff.","{112083393: 4, 13230: 4, 112551257: 4, 200371681: 4, 200038210: 4, 110965253: 4, 200216421: 4, 112008180: 4, 110997740: 4, 110967113: 4, 106399334: 4, 200841608: 4, 111680549: 3, 109492070: 3, 109943766: 3, 108104464: 3, 105795851: 3, 112400297: 3, 110248880: 3, 200181593: 3, 108429138: 3, 107847782: 3, 200103195: 3, 111237977: 3, 110206802: 3, 108412656: 3, 106068121: 3, 110731835: 3, 110621264: 3, 111644949: 2, 111448775: 2, 15023: 2, 112113501: 0}"

Havent put any real work in, but it seems like 4-5 bolts of high end bouldering on thin pockets giving way to patina crimps, with just enough holds to definitely go. While a few isolated holds are decent enough to chalk the other hand for a bit, there are never two good, or matchable holds in close proximity so it seems like 15-20 moves of uninterrupted power-endurance will be in order. It is currently kindof sharp.
