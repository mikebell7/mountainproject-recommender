This is a great example of 5.11a fingers. Footwork is key as there are many small feet on the face.     Pitch 1: 5.11a follow the picture-perfect, finger crack to a tree with a fixed sling and rings. Most people only do the first pitch.

Camber,105920725.0,Trad,105920712.0,5.11b,0.0,2.0,3.8,48.0,"This is one of my favorite climbs I've ever done. So much exposure, an intricate sequence, and good protection (at the crux, anyway) make it practically perfect in every way. Though 5.11b may seem a low grade by modern standards, you will find that you will work for this one both mentally and physically.    Pitch 1: From the anchor at the top of the Saigon's, head up and left past a bolt, run it out a little farther left to another bolt clip this with a long runner, and run it out up and right to gain more bolts that are closer together (the runouts at the base are what keeps this route from being a sport climb). It may be 5.8R in parts.    An interesting sub-crux will be tricky though finding the crimps and high stepping will get you through. The corner above to the mantel at the anchor is the true crux, and it might take a while to work it out. The falls are safe though a bit airy.    Pitch 2: This pitch is commonly known as Reverse Camber. Up the slab (5.10b) past drilled pins, then break left in to a crack that leads to a notch to finish. Build a belay at the top in a hand-size crack.","{111030282: 4, 107846658: 4, 106178530: 4, 106775653: 4, 10168: 4, 107377680: 4, 106720416: 4, 106579529: 4, 106146571: 4, 107056968: 4, 13364: 4, 107852661: 4, 112042073: 4, 200189661: 4, 105084340: 4, 107209622: 4, 110024218: 4, 109383300: 4, 106741672: 4, 106577584: 4, 106426493: 4, 10610: 4, 12227: 4, 14212: 4, 107380441: 4, 105906559: 4, 106360234: 4, 105945019: 4, 106229076: 4, 107226876: 4, 106389004: 4, 105941791: 4, 106670299: 4, 106441684: 4, 106011053: 4, 106460502: 4, 106191055: 3, 107552617: 3, 110762698: 3, 109884427: 3, 106168303: 3, 106213030: 3, 105798365: 3, 107141348: 3, 106158148: 3, 106646308: 3, 111841723: 2}"

The moves are somewhat sustained, but it's the protection scares most people away - thus it is not so popular.  The crux section comes about half way up and is both psychological (run out) and physical.  Hitting the small ledge where the route starts is possible depending upon where you fall in the 5.11 section.  The crack has some pocket type features that are cool.

Though it is a crack climb, it is not very straightforward, and you might do well to keep an eye out for some foot holds on the face.

Pine Tree is highly recommended for its interesting moves and awesome exposed positioning.","{107572777: 4, 107618553: 4, 105906559: 4, 105832216: 4, 107178233: 4, 105943577: 4, 105839151: 4, 105922881: 4, 106460502: 4, 107255799: 4, 106280222: 4, 106128599: 4, 106441684: 4, 105899248: 4, 106229076: 4, 106011053: 4, 106134707: 4, 106726952: 4, 106883693: 4, 106670299: 4, 106895019: 4, 106412174: 4, 106054402: 4, 107138006: 4, 106680929: 4, 106957118: 4, 106784559: 4, 107166148: 4, 106360234: 4, 108409574: 4, 106022427: 4, 106720416: 4, 107620610: 4, 107730254: 4, 106702886: 4, 108293163: 4, 106978809: 4, 107257835: 4, 108257055: 4, 106852549: 4, 107346586: 4, 108202763: 4, 108188613: 4, 107744798: 4, 106567319: 4, 107222279: 4, 107492957: 4, 107786821: 4, 109157864: 4, 106538248: 4, 108187975: 4, 107619140: 4, 109284031: 4, 108216908: 4, 107238223: 4, 107852661: 4, 108181716: 4, 107324126: 4, 107246852: 4, 110454932: 4, 108815486: 4, 106578430: 4, 110457315: 4, 108179333: 4, 110726793: 4, 109448507: 4, 107842362: 4, 106210225: 4, 107068335: 4, 108252197: 4, 107262433: 4, 108137876: 4, 105890911: 4, 107755397: 4, 110317485: 4, 110138155: 4, 106662131: 4, 110619029: 4, 108222002: 4, 110494556: 4, 105898385: 4, 109273711: 4, 107929356: 4, 108032974: 4, 110547878: 4, 109383300: 4, 109490709: 4, 106095990: 4, 110369169: 4, 112207022: 4, 107363666: 4, 200099982: 4, 110232870: 4, 110974889: 4, 109585594: 4, 108392908: 4, 110937405: 4, 112134112: 4, 111789786: 4, 200064982: 4, 111414778: 4, 107460666: 4, 108076264: 4, 111231935: 4, 200105825: 4, 105790750: 4, 110592577: 4, 200230025: 4, 106435507: 4, 106399472: 4, 200345231: 4, 107544688: 4, 107617264: 4, 112507024: 4, 109414386: 4, 110739544: 4, 108091988: 4, 200325292: 4, 111849990: 4, 111278312: 4, 200079158: 4, 200249886: 4, 111674806: 4, 200063563: 4, 110452119: 4, 107727480: 4, 200189661: 4, 112066146: 4, 200140229: 4, 200352310: 4, 200195571: 4, 13364: 4, 111030282: 4, 200441044: 4, 200381231: 4, 108194233: 4, 200056611: 4, 200489071: 4, 200471417: 4, 200297969: 4, 200711420: 4, 7058825: 4, 200452607: 4, 200762242: 4, 111142184: 4, 112890806: 4, 107494537: 3, 107473975: 3, 107245933: 3, 10610: 3, 105888978: 3, 105927660: 3, 105886426: 3, 107646553: 3, 107448536: 3, 107431656: 3, 105801390: 3, 105887867: 3, 107086578: 3, 107056968: 3, 106679659: 3, 106168303: 3, 106205646: 3, 106213030: 3, 14212: 3, 105837907: 3, 107380441: 3, 12525: 3, 106342472: 3, 105895298: 3, 106430658: 3, 106235451: 3, 105945019: 3, 106751248: 3, 106803769: 3, 106588555: 3, 106876834: 3, 106741672: 3, 105941791: 3, 106936938: 3, 106486112: 3, 106531595: 3, 108082584: 3, 106579529: 3, 107555169: 3, 107783937: 3, 107827568: 3, 106932322: 3, 107552617: 3, 108241533: 3, 106736701: 3, 106971875: 3, 108222065: 3, 108326068: 3, 108843325: 3, 106871882: 3, 107226876: 3, 106889934: 3, 107746328: 3, 107116332: 3, 106879280: 3, 107169450: 3, 106978267: 3, 106569451: 3, 107941356: 3, 107272204: 3, 106394111: 3, 106411679: 3, 109584993: 3, 108392741: 3, 106146571: 3, 110356941: 3, 107453284: 3, 107820617: 3, 108343619: 3, 109479296: 3, 109816235: 3, 110522591: 3, 111045477: 3, 108652563: 3, 111841723: 3, 110315255: 3, 108507566: 3, 109393254: 3, 106990659: 3, 110152422: 3, 108899032: 3, 109466226: 3, 109255473: 3, 106417094: 3, 109638995: 3, 111769967: 3, 108301940: 3, 107212540: 3, 200117350: 3, 107146835: 3, 110813958: 3, 109692317: 3, 107032446: 3, 109411750: 3, 108871640: 3, 107569651: 3, 200101052: 3, 110900723: 3, 107481755: 3, 106426493: 3, 108200547: 3, 200152826: 3, 200060911: 3, 200067404: 3, 107764394: 3, 112261455: 3, 109142435: 3, 200296165: 3, 200154262: 3, 110756813: 3, 111737693: 3, 5717666: 3, 200153055: 3, 200207343: 3, 109462531: 3, 112042073: 3, 111066391: 3, 111344408: 3, 109193524: 3, 112091216: 3, 200286421: 3, 200320317: 3, 200154821: 3, 200078397: 3, 106554217: 3, 112034333: 3, 111649446: 3, 200423818: 3, 106191055: 3, 111496831: 3, 200253280: 3, 200101132: 3, 108692265: 3, 200063417: 3, 200427395: 3, 109057647: 3, 112142591: 3, 200334316: 3, 110591893: 3, 107688970: 2, 107658399: 2, 105890157: 2, 106125724: 2, 106577584: 2, 107078738: 2, 105889415: 2, 105798761: 2, 106647777: 2, 107494185: 2, 110046547: 2, 108050314: 2, 110762698: 2, 111733036: 2, 111928324: 2, 106793247: 2, 106967283: 2, 200302765: 2, 200041302: 2, 200150635: 2, 108943993: 2, 111692889: 2, 200335317: 2, 200155809: 2, 112846784: 2, 109581799: 1, 109363594: 1}"

Lichen Delight is Cathedral 5.11 crack climbing at its best. This is a great way to break in to 5.11 climbing at Cathedral. Though its not soft in the grade, it is well protected and as moderate as 5.11s get at this cliff. Lichen Delight is also much longer than the other classic 5.11a: Airation. As you might guess, this one is a test of endurance rather than a few hard moves.    There is an obscure 2nd pitch, but most people will rap off from a tree with slings. You can also traverse right to the finish of Retaliation (5.9, however, the finish is 5.6).    Right from Nomad Crack (5.10b) find the left facing corner with a small tree growing out of it low down and a handcrack splitting it. Start from a ledge and do a boulder problem to get up in to the corner. Climb the corner utilizing the hand crack. This part is moderate and really fun but not to be taken lightly. Conserve energy for the crux. The corner ends at a roof. Protect and exit right around the roof/corner to gain a finger crack.

While Lichen Delight goes out right at the roof, Lichen It a Lot goes out left and makes a few hard moves in to a small, left facing, bottomless corner with a very thin crack in it.

Upper Refuse,105938018.0,Trad,105908828.0,5.5,200.0,3.0,3.0,328.0,"Upper Refuse is an awesome, moderate route with great climbing, great protection, and great exposure for the grade--a true Cathedral classic. One of very few, real moderates on the cliff, this is a perfect first trad climb.     It can be accessed by hiking around from the top along the big ledge. If you are a beginner, you might want to rope up for the last part of the scramble due to the danger of a BIG fall if you slip. Most people climb Upper Refuse after coming up Fun House (5.7) or another moderate route, though as the name implies there is a Lower Refuse which is not nearly as popular.    Pitch 1: (5.3) Start up the ramp on really easy climbing, and keep an eye out for a few good slots for cam placements. Belay at a good stance at a few pins (back em up with gear) at the top of the ramp section.    Pitch 2: (5.5) Choose your own adventure. Go right up a groveling ""V"" chimney (not hard but not too fun, in my opinion), or from the belay go up and left following cracks to a layback and a few slabby moves (much more fun). These two choices meet up in a gully formation which you follow to another choice. Breaking right up a crack directly to a pine tree ledge is preferred by most; however, you can avoid a little difficulty by continuing up the gully, then stepping right on to the ledge. Belay from a pine tree on a very comfortable ledge.    Pitch 3: (5.5) Two choices again: follow cracks and face climbing straight up above the ledge (this is the usual finish and the one I like better), or if exposure isn't your thing, stick to the corner on the left following a wide, layback crack. Both of these lead to the same ledge at the top where you can go up a short slab to belay from trees. The pins were removed from the top of the climb last season and I think it stayed that way.    The climb can be done in one long rope stretch with a 60m rope. Rope drag can be rough so plan for that in advance. This is one of the most crowded climbs on the cliff, so on a busy day, plan on making a day of it and meeting lots of new friends.","{107608024: 4, 107323239: 4, 107637217: 4, 107178233: 4, 105906559: 4, 107699621: 4, 105943577: 4, 107464151: 4, 106794962: 4, 107794476: 4, 106460502: 4, 105987922: 4, 106480214: 4, 105945019: 4, 106573919: 4, 10610: 4, 106011891: 4, 106134707: 4, 106586290: 4, 106860562: 4, 107167101: 4, 106577584: 4, 107138006: 4, 106567319: 4, 106469016: 4, 106919626: 4, 106720416: 4, 107730254: 4, 108326068: 4, 107242815: 4, 107723931: 4, 107555107: 4, 109212068: 4, 110454932: 4, 107494185: 4, 106990659: 4, 107820617: 4, 108276722: 4, 107165587: 4, 109136692: 4, 109479296: 4, 110665446: 4, 107852661: 4, 108252197: 4, 112295294: 4, 111870630: 4, 111696814: 4, 111916761: 4, 112207022: 4, 200093946: 4, 110232870: 4, 107481755: 4, 106873076: 4, 110762698: 4, 111414778: 4, 112091216: 4, 200253082: 4, 200078397: 4, 106399472: 4, 200153055: 4, 112038160: 4, 200063563: 4, 200155803: 4, 112128138: 4, 200056611: 4, 106191055: 4, 13364: 4, 200441044: 4, 200253285: 4, 108406663: 4, 200106485: 4, 111849990: 4, 106486112: 3, 107572777: 3, 106698297: 3, 106716166: 3, 106870484: 3, 107630281: 3, 107635859: 3, 106852549: 3, 106871882: 3, 107646553: 3, 105797501: 3, 106971875: 3, 107324126: 3, 105801390: 3, 107026497: 3, 106917454: 3, 106874511: 3, 107889804: 3, 105895298: 3, 105949899: 3, 106168303: 3, 106213030: 3, 105922881: 3, 106306579: 3, 107380441: 3, 105941791: 3, 106247496: 3, 106358364: 3, 106569969: 3, 106426493: 3, 106726952: 3, 106751248: 3, 106780889: 3, 106125724: 3, 105938601: 3, 106803769: 3, 106372764: 3, 11167: 3, 106417094: 3, 106670299: 3, 106178530: 3, 106643870: 3, 106680875: 3, 105889415: 3, 106554048: 3, 106957118: 3, 106741672: 3, 106576182: 3, 106679659: 3, 107322165: 3, 106130656: 3, 107078738: 3, 107029006: 3, 107604779: 3, 107518458: 3, 107579039: 3, 106702886: 3, 108167549: 3, 108293163: 3, 106579529: 3, 107377680: 3, 108355208: 3, 106978809: 3, 108222002: 3, 106360234: 3, 107255799: 3, 108855374: 3, 106538248: 3, 107552617: 3, 109206743: 3, 108187975: 3, 107246852: 3, 107346586: 3, 106892600: 3, 106879280: 3, 106578430: 3, 109679405: 3, 108972429: 3, 107492957: 3, 109693572: 3, 106852567: 3, 107941247: 3, 107827568: 3, 108137876: 3, 109457525: 3, 108911162: 3, 107238223: 3, 108138324: 3, 106411679: 3, 109280499: 3, 109290328: 3, 110735180: 3, 108392741: 3, 109279277: 3, 109584993: 3, 108179333: 3, 107917066: 3, 110356941: 3, 107763339: 3, 109884416: 3, 110650583: 3, 10232: 3, 110619029: 3, 110522591: 3, 110923255: 3, 105801659: 3, 105890911: 3, 111541482: 3, 111785033: 3, 108711491: 3, 111813475: 3, 107226876: 3, 110317485: 3, 109037119: 3, 110327172: 3, 111888875: 3, 108282189: 3, 112021523: 3, 111045477: 3, 108507566: 3, 110547878: 3, 111817065: 3, 107794900: 3, 109490709: 3, 106095990: 3, 110336734: 3, 111780243: 3, 109157864: 3, 111796230: 3, 111914048: 3, 108802410: 3, 113061093: 3, 107120057: 3, 111657384: 3, 200067404: 3, 110813958: 3, 111278312: 3, 111894693: 3, 112134112: 3, 112164950: 3, 109411750: 3, 200122335: 3, 111610436: 3, 111783002: 3, 200157154: 3, 200064982: 3, 110989228: 3, 112050804: 3, 107929356: 3, 110645674: 3, 108181716: 3, 112261455: 3, 110270643: 3, 111142184: 3, 200154262: 3, 200179659: 3, 106435507: 3, 200345231: 3, 110756813: 3, 111982873: 3, 110262256: 3, 106554217: 3, 200228539: 3, 106646308: 3, 110440965: 3, 200299677: 3, 106441684: 3, 200246542: 3, 200370044: 3, 110452119: 3, 200403371: 3, 106430658: 3, 200286421: 3, 106407009: 3, 107727480: 3, 200309821: 3, 200265615: 3, 200386343: 3, 112066146: 3, 111969490: 3, 107548227: 3, 112373727: 3, 200441478: 3, 113077522: 3, 200381231: 3, 110712867: 3, 106342472: 3, 110580607: 3, 107540375: 3, 200679140: 3, 107691094: 3, 200213938: 3, 109057647: 3, 106709846: 3, 200384668: 3, 200743821: 3, 110591893: 3, 107619437: 2, 105927660: 2, 106784621: 2, 107431656: 2, 106299993: 2, 107430107: 2, 106300559: 2, 106145409: 2, 106158148: 2, 106188401: 2, 106588555: 2, 108050314: 2, 106993942: 2, 107793593: 2, 106536997: 2, 107696530: 2, 108711756: 2, 109108961: 2, 107786821: 2, 109316466: 2, 106647777: 2, 108188613: 2, 109411206: 2, 109608840: 2, 106146571: 2, 106967283: 2, 107169450: 2, 108200547: 2, 108343619: 2, 111876056: 2, 111087111: 2, 108100269: 2, 108188495: 2, 106193141: 2, 112102872: 2, 110259196: 2, 106868421: 2, 111928324: 2, 106210225: 2, 105934900: 2, 108179890: 2, 112042073: 2, 200427395: 2, 112166651: 2, 200041302: 2, 200282021: 2, 200423818: 2, 200195571: 2, 200406385: 2, 106531595: 1, 107555169: 1, 108608330: 1, 108110667: 1, 109581799: 1, 111841723: 1, 112225055: 1, 110878214: 1, 110046547: 0}"

Described by Handren as ""a very strenuous and sustained route, one of the classic hard crack climbs on the East Coast.""  The FFA of Women in Love is a classic example of the race to free aid pitches in the late 70s. Visiting Mark Hudon and Max Jones (who nearly FFAed the Salathé Wall on El Cap) asked Webster if the top of Women in Love could go free. Webster lied, saying that the headwall was impossible to free climb -- “smooth as a baby’s bottom.” He then quickly enlisted Henry Barber to free the top pitches. As they were working the last pitch, Hudon and Jones saw them from the ground and steamrolled through the lower pitches. They caught up with Webster as he was following Barber (who dislocated his shoulder during the send, but popped it back in mid-climb) on the final pitch. Hudon slapped at Webster’s heels as he and Jones completed the route’s second ascent. Webster and Achey completed the full ""Wild Women"" route one year later.  Start on the route, ""Wild""  P1. (11b) Start with easy moves up a right facing corner and quickly reach a big ledge. From the ledge, climb straight up a discontinuous finger crack. Traverse right at the roof (crux, finger-sized cams helpful) and end at a bolted anchor on a sloping ledge.   P2. Climb up easy ledges with very few options for protection. This will lead you to a choice. (10R): Follow the dihedral to a bolt, then climb above it, being certain that you won't slip off. Bypass variation (5.7): Skip the R-rated climbing by escaping left onto the Barber Wall ledge and then traverse back right.  End on a sloping ledge below the beautiful first pitch of “Women in Love.”  P3. (12-) The prettiest pitch on the route and some of the best climbing. Work your way up the pearly white granite crack, which constrains to thin finger locks and two unforgettable mono-locks. End at a sloping ledge.  P4.

While cleaning the route on rappel in 1976, Ed Webster placed a bolt on the final slab, then was unable to even climb up to it. Everyone got a good chuckle out of this, but the best was yet to come.   Several years later, just for fun, Alain Comeau and several conspirators ""borrowed"" ten speed bicycle, rappelled down, and hung it off the offensive bolt, no doubt as a warning against any future ethical slippages! Paul Ross even went so far as to sneak Webster's camera along to photograph the event for posterity. But-as fate would have it- John Bragg @ Jay Wilson were climbing INTIMIDATION later that very same day. One can only imagine their incredulity upon noticing a ten speed bicylcle suspended out in the middle of a blank wall, and the subsequent argument over who saw it first! The bicycle was speedily rescued, albeit on a top-rope.   When the conspirators discovered the premature rescue of the bicycle, it was seized from Bragg and Wilson, and returned to its ignominious perch for the second time in the same day! There it remained for about two weeks until Webster finally rescued it-and alas, the poor bicycle was never quite the same again.

This is one of the best multi-pitch 5.10s in NH.    The moderate climbing between the cruxes can be a bit run out, and though the hard parts can be scary, they are protected well enough (maybe PG13). The only real R rated climbing is the second pitch traverse and it goes at 5.8.    Pitch one: (5.10b) Start up the moderate ramp system heading toward the corner/crack. Sling two nuts together (I use #10 stoppers) and use them to reach a good high placement before making the moves in to the crack. Without this trick, the pitch is R rated for sure.   Continue up the corner and gain a well deserved rest and a bolt. The crux in my opinion is making a move left after the bolt using crimps to make a big reach and throwing a heelhook up to mantel. From here, climb moderately to the 2 bolt anchor.    Pitch 2: (5.8R) Climb up and clip a pin before making a hair-raising traverse left away from your gear. The climbing is slabby and gets harder as you move left until you get a thank god hold. You can then get a marginal placement to protect your second by climbing back above the traverse and placing a cam in a pocket...This gear is not great so don't bring a second that is not solid on 5.8 friction.    Pitch 3: (5.9+) Climb up above and to the right from the tree ledge gaining a thin crack with some tricky moves involving some face climbing. After you reach a good ledge, continue up a corner to a kick ass right leaning crack that leads to a small stance where you can belay.    Pitch 4:(5.9+) Continue up the right-leaning crack (harder than it looks) and up over a steep section and on to easier climbing.

The left of the two pins seems to have a little bend in it that I only realized when my second got up to me and saw it moving. This was after he hung on the crux a bit too... whoops!

Pitch 5: (5.9) It won't take you long to find the absolutely perfect, hand crack heading up from the ledge.

Optional protection between this and the next 2 bolts (I guess there is a place for a pink tricam, but I've not used it). This pitch is fun all on its own, and works well to get to the ledge where you can link up with a few other routes. Belay from the anchor just left and up from the pine tree.    Pitch 2: (5.11c) Slab/thin face climbing. Think friction, you will need it. Not recommended on a hot day.    From the anchor, take a few steps right and start up the smooth slab. This part was much harder than I thought it would be. Climb using dime edges and crazy body tension past bolts towards the small overlap above (crux). At the crux overlap, there is an OK rest but not much. Then try to find your way over or around this feature. I tried to go left where it was cleaner and fell a few times. My partner went a little right where it was kinda dirty and made it nice and clean. Bottom line is that the sequence is not obvious. After this, head up angling slightly right up the relentless steep slab. I remember only one ""real"" rest, balancing on a small foot hold crimp. Continue up to the big ledge and belay from a tree.    Typing this brings back happy nightmares....

From here, choose your way to the tree ledge...The normal finish from here is Upper Refuse (5.5) or you could do any number of other great routes at harder grades than 5.7....","{107608024: 4, 105906559: 4, 105943577: 4, 106460502: 4, 105922881: 4, 106280222: 4, 106978809: 4, 106399472: 4, 107380441: 4, 106191055: 4, 106573919: 4, 106648215: 4, 106803769: 4, 106108233: 4, 11926: 4, 107097819: 4, 107167101: 4, 106469016: 4, 106486112: 4, 107730254: 4, 108293163: 4, 108222002: 4, 108326068: 4, 108187975: 4, 106586290: 4, 107723931: 4, 108087249: 4, 109280290: 4, 107619140: 4, 109693572: 4, 108521517: 4, 109498650: 4, 109212068: 4, 107917066: 4, 109884416: 4, 109581799: 4, 107078738: 4, 109545197: 4, 109936563: 4, 106536923: 4, 109136692: 4, 108188495: 4, 108282189: 4, 105898385: 4, 110356941: 4, 111646735: 4, 111964000: 4, 108181716: 4, 107737400: 4, 111780243: 4, 112207022: 4, 110232870: 4, 200154125: 4, 108032974: 4, 112261455: 4, 200113951: 4, 106388711: 4, 107842362: 4, 109193524: 4, 200079158: 4, 106793614: 4, 110739544: 4, 200282021: 4, 200056611: 4, 107242815: 3, 107572777: 3, 106698297: 3, 107635859: 3, 107323239: 3, 107637217: 3, 106306579: 3, 107178233: 3, 106787640: 3, 105927660: 3, 106784621: 3, 107699621: 3, 107646553: 3, 106554048: 3, 107431656: 3, 105899248: 3, 107324126: 3, 105801390: 3, 106716166: 3, 106917454: 3, 106039986: 3, 107100666: 3, 106441684: 3, 107660333: 3, 105895298: 3, 106168303: 3, 106150571: 3, 105941791: 3, 106011891: 3, 106276608: 3, 106430658: 3, 106358364: 3, 105945019: 3, 106426493: 3, 106134707: 3, 106726952: 3, 106584542: 3, 106142131: 3, 106372764: 3, 11167: 3, 106224522: 3, 106680875: 3, 106643870: 3, 106412174: 3, 106577584: 3, 107138006: 3, 106567319: 3, 106957118: 3, 106679659: 3, 105890157: 3, 106720416: 3, 106327852: 3, 107790918: 3, 108050314: 3, 106579529: 3, 107029006: 3, 106993942: 3, 107793593: 3, 107518458: 3, 106702886: 3, 108202763: 3, 106578430: 3, 107226876: 3, 108711756: 3, 106538248: 3, 107552617: 3, 107763339: 3, 107548227: 3, 107786821: 3, 109198603: 3, 107942262: 3, 108843325: 3, 108266600: 3, 107617264: 3, 106586268: 3, 108188613: 3, 109411206: 3, 107346586: 3, 106852549: 3, 106879280: 3, 106299993: 3, 109608840: 3, 107555107: 3, 108068059: 3, 110046547: 3, 107941247: 3, 108911162: 3, 107238223: 3, 108138324: 3, 108815486: 3, 106417094: 3, 108110667: 3, 107464151: 3, 107706359: 3, 109290328: 3, 110735180: 3, 109584993: 3, 110454932: 3, 108179333: 3, 109448507: 3, 107494185: 3, 110522591: 3, 108276722: 3, 110923255: 3, 105890911: 3, 107755397: 3, 109490709: 3, 111785033: 3, 108711491: 3, 106662131: 3, 109037119: 3, 110494556: 3, 111682044: 3, 110930259: 3, 109479296: 3, 111087111: 3, 107852661: 3, 111004308: 3, 110315255: 3, 105859360: 3, 108652563: 3, 110138155: 3, 110762698: 3, 110547878: 3, 108252197: 3, 106990659: 3, 110668667: 3, 106095990: 3, 110369169: 3, 109466226: 3, 108802410: 3, 113061093: 3, 112166651: 3, 111916761: 3, 111657384: 3, 200093946: 3, 107209622: 3, 110813958: 3, 111894693: 3, 111278312: 3, 112164950: 3, 109411750: 3, 112050804: 3, 200067404: 3, 106646308: 3, 200180156: 3, 111796230: 3, 112134112: 3, 112091216: 3, 108310475: 3, 111142184: 3, 200154262: 3, 110756813: 3, 110262256: 3, 110875851: 3, 200264657: 3, 106514856: 3, 112038160: 3, 200063563: 3, 112131062: 3, 108529353: 3, 200179659: 3, 200427395: 3, 109414386: 3, 111849990: 3, 200249886: 3, 200248995: 3, 111969490: 3, 200286421: 3, 200078397: 3, 5717666: 3, 200265615: 3, 200041302: 3, 200386343: 3, 112066146: 3, 113077522: 3, 107540375: 3, 200345231: 3, 200423818: 3, 200195571: 3, 200194815: 3, 200334316: 3, 13364: 3, 200441044: 3, 200253280: 3, 110712867: 3, 200209525: 3, 200350797: 3, 200213938: 3, 200381231: 3, 110591893: 3, 106709846: 3, 200621815: 3, 200384668: 3, 200743821: 3, 200074424: 3, 107619437: 2, 107322165: 2, 11687: 2, 105797501: 2, 105997912: 2, 107066178: 2, 106576182: 2, 10610: 2, 105885428: 2, 106202599: 2, 106158148: 2, 106751248: 2, 106125724: 2, 106588555: 2, 105889415: 2, 106531595: 2, 106919626: 2, 106741672: 2, 107450109: 2, 108167549: 2, 107085584: 2, 107696530: 2, 106360234: 2, 109269951: 2, 108855374: 2, 106971875: 2, 108972429: 2, 107827568: 2, 108137876: 2, 107253706: 2, 107246852: 2, 108392741: 2, 106210225: 2, 110457315: 2, 106146571: 2, 110349103: 2, 107169450: 2, 111888875: 2, 111876056: 2, 110906560: 2, 111841723: 2, 112037097: 2, 111426811: 2, 110152422: 2, 110510769: 2, 106868421: 2, 109157864: 2, 106897206: 2, 200083231: 2, 110327172: 2, 108200547: 2, 105875389: 2, 111066391: 2, 200122335: 2, 111610436: 2, 107481755: 2, 111414778: 2, 107460666: 2, 105934900: 2, 200153055: 2, 107395185: 2, 200228539: 2, 107727480: 2, 200253082: 2, 112142591: 2, 109316466: 2, 200155809: 2, 200815206: 2, 107533935: 2, 200160167: 2, 106449525: 2, 105808487: 1, 106647777: 1, 109363594: 1}"

It also needs a little more traffic...it is very dirty. Start by moving left into the cracks in the corner, laybacking and stemming up to a bolt. Clip it long and move to the right for some more laybacking up to the huge nose of rock. Chimney up this to a good stance.    Pitch 4: 5.8, 70'. From the stance, continue up through some trees to a nice hand crack in the back of a corner, to a small roof. Traverse left under the roof with more ease, but with much less protection, to the belay ledge below The Bridge.    Pitch 5: 5.11d, 70'.

Plus, this is a nice way to climb the stellar upper crack of Recluse without having to do that route's heinous boulder problem start.","{106125724: 3, 106726952: 3, 200357316: 3, 10610: 2}"

I was quite pleasantly surprised at the quality of the climbing since I've never heard much good said about it.     Here are the pros:   Great movement   Well protected   Conveniently located   Never crowded    Cons:   Often wet   Not as clean as They Died Laughing   A loose block or two    So you can make your own call. Your mission, should you choose to except it, begins in the corner capped by a roof, to the left of the popular section of the North End.   Climb moderate moves up the corner until you can gain cracks and jugs on the right wall. Climb these wonderful features to the right end of the roof over your head. Continue up the corner above for another 10-15 feet to a nice ledge.     You can belay/rap from here via a sling on tree anchor, or continue (straight up or up and right) to a two-bolt anchor above. Several nice pitches can be accessed from there.","{107897881: 4, 200155809: 4, 107929356: 4, 200118104: 4, 111787439: 4, 108179333: 4, 107820617: 4, 110494556: 4, 112166651: 4, 112373727: 4, 112128138: 4, 200056611: 4, 108916902: 4, 112523297: 4, 112938047: 4, 109411750: 3, 107552617: 3, 112042073: 3, 112038160: 3, 106868421: 3, 106720416: 3, 106399472: 3, 111657384: 3, 200164016: 3, 109462531: 3, 200296165: 3, 109490709: 3, 106967283: 3, 200061159: 3, 110739544: 3, 111650569: 3, 107232890: 3, 110762698: 3, 110689679: 3, 200078397: 3, 105898385: 3, 110327172: 3, 200350797: 3, 200441044: 3, 112507024: 3, 111928324: 3, 108943993: 3, 200253285: 3, 200253280: 3, 106965842: 3, 108032974: 3, 106125724: 3, 106210225: 3, 106897206: 3, 106460502: 3, 111066391: 3, 109448507: 3, 109260781: 3, 106486112: 3, 106215535: 3, 108202763: 3, 106360234: 3, 107617264: 3, 106578430: 3, 106579529: 3, 105801390: 3, 106726952: 3, 107494185: 3, 111426811: 3, 110454932: 3, 106852549: 3, 109550390: 3, 109363594: 3, 200154125: 3, 107469778: 3, 200073484: 3, 108159370: 3, 105851541: 3, 110974889: 3, 108222002: 3, 106741672: 3, 109479296: 3, 106095990: 3, 200331350: 2, 109269951: 2, 106577584: 2, 112207022: 2, 108050314: 2, 105906559: 2, 106426493: 2, 106449525: 2, 111841723: 2, 107169450: 2, 200253082: 2}"

If the route were closer to the ground, the moves themselves would make Edge a four-star climb. But it's the exposure, oh the exposure, that ranks Edge of The World as one of the most classic rock climbs imaginable.     The climb begins at the Space Station belay, four pitches up the Prow. (Most people rap in to this belay from the top of the cliff). Edge shares Liquid Sky's insecure 12a moves off the belay. At Liquid Sky's first pin, Edge diverges left, up the soaring arete.    Gaining the arete is the crux of the route and involves a very hard pull off a small right-hand crimp. This crimp is the size usually reserved for footholds. Once on the arete, the climbing becomes incredible. Left hand slaps and right hand pinches characterize the movement through this section. The climbing here is powerful yet surprisingly precise and subtle.     After three well-spaced bolts of hard climbing, a runout leads to the top of the arete, where a fixed nut is usually in place. While the climbing in this section clocks in at ""only"" 10+, the exposure and potential for a 50-foot fall make this the mental crux of the route. At the very top of the arete, a jug allows the climber to lean back and take in the spectacular situation. This really is the edge of the world.",{10610: 4}

To lead, rappel to the ledge, set a belay in the Recompense corner and give your climber a vote of confidence as he smears, slaps, and finesses his way to the top.

If it was nice and clean I feel like it would be four stars for sure; however, right now two stars is a bit if a stretch.    The moves are awesome, the route is super obvious and aesthetic, it would just need a ton of traffic to keep it clean. The R rated sections include a very committing slab run out to the belay ledge on Pitch 2 and the danger of falling on a sharp block on pitch 3 (at 6'2"" I was able to make a long reach to place a piece and avoid this danger). People have done major cleaning in the past, and due to the location of the climb (a wet spot) and low traffic, the vegetation comes back quickly.

I will describe the money pitch as I do not have experience with the other pitches.    Liquid Sky is perhaps New Hampshire's most aesthetic hard route, as the crux pitch climbs a very thin crack that slashes right across the overhanging wall right of the Prow, 400 feet or so off the ground. The difficulty is contained in this twenty foot stretch of crack. When the crack jogs upward and climbs directly up the wall, the holds become bigger and the climbing becomes less technical.    To start, get yourself to the Space Station belay, the third belay on the Prow. You can climb up the Prow to reach this hanging stance. More likely, though, you can rap from the top of the cliff to a belay at the top of the LS crux pitch. Fix the rope here and rap again (still with the same rope) to the Space Station Belay.     Climb up right off the belay, up the blunt arete that marks the very edge of the wall (5.12a). Two pins can be found at the start of the crack. You might chose to stick clip one or both of them. Once the crack is gained, engage in uber-technical climbing, using the angling crack for sidepulls, underclings, anything that makes your feet stick on the little nothings on the blank wall. The crux is moving from the last pin (which, by the way, is tied off because it sticks out about an inch. A tied off sling is usually in-situ) to the bolt at the end of the angling crack. From here, steep climbing (5.11+) with better gear leads to the two bolt belay stance.    All of the gear on the angling crack is fixed. You may chose to prehang draws on the pins and the bolt as you rap down to the belay stance.","{10610: 4, 12227: 4, 108032974: 4, 200765134: 4}"

If you like wide crack climbing this is a must do.","{107056968: 4, 13364: 4, 107169450: 4, 106538248: 4, 200387844: 4, 200219142: 4, 112042073: 4, 107633879: 4, 108032974: 4, 106360234: 4, 14723: 4, 105906559: 4, 105941791: 4, 106460502: 4, 106011053: 4, 106158148: 4, 112507024: 3, 10610: 3, 106168303: 3, 106586290: 3, 110152422: 3, 105084340: 3, 111841723: 3, 107141348: 3, 107494185: 3, 110046547: 2}"
The Prow,106011864.0,Trad,105908834.0,5.11d,350.0,6.0,3.9,81.0,"This is a/an historical, direct, and elegant line that ascends the Prow Buttress, to the right of Recompense. If you look at the perfectly sculpted arete, the Prow never veers farther than about 10 or 15 feet away from the edge. It is utterly classic, both as an aid climb and as a free climb. The pitches are mostly short and fierce. North Conway hardmen supposedly put in many days of hard work to free this in the 1970s. It's still considered a quite a challenge to climb it without falling.The first pitch has several variations, I think the standard way goes up a corner in a slab at about 5.9 or 5.10a. It is a great little pitch by itself, with a little smearing and a lot of laybacking.The second pitch goes at about 5.11c and makes use of a few bolts. Crank through a tough section that goes a bit past vertical, gain the crack, clip the pitons, and get after that slab. The latter part of the pitch is supposedly only about 5.10a, but it has frustratingly tiny hand and footholds.The third pitch goes to the right, around the arete, and up a very unique thin crack, again at about 5.10a. The crux comes when you awkwardly pull around the arete about midway up the pitch.The fourth pitch is exposed and wild! It gets hard right off the bat. The crux is really a boulder problem (5.11c/d). Climb straight up above to a seam, which turns into an awesome and strenuous finger crack that ends at the Space Station belay (a hanging belay from bomber bolts with feet on sloping ramp). A couple of pins exist within the crack still. A variation that's supposedly a bit easier technically climbs to the left off the belay and then rejoins the crack.The very steep fifth pitch is the crux. Make hard moves to the left from the belay, climb up thin cracks, and gain the dihedral. Stem carefully and economically up the airy, hanging corner until you get to the Triangle Roof. Now you can expend that energy you've been saving by boldly busting out that roof on the right. It's a real grunt - and a redpoint heartbreaker!If you've made it this far without falling, it's in the bag. The last pitch is gravy...dreamy 5.9 fingerlocks on a nicely featured slab seem downright easy after what you just went through. The angle finally steepens and you crank through the last few dramatic moves with perfect protection. For those of us who are cheaters, the tree roots make perfect jugs en route.There now, that wasn't that bad...if you pulled on gear!","{200156794: 4, 106146571: 4, 106578430: 4, 106538248: 4, 107633879: 4, 110904912: 4, 110152422: 4, 109490709: 4, 107297910: 4, 108032974: 4, 112097145: 4, 111996731: 4, 107128552: 4, 109136692: 4, 108276722: 4, 106325770: 4, 106775653: 4, 107852661: 4, 106552384: 4, 105084340: 4, 200163780: 4, 14723: 4, 200253082: 4, 106646308: 4, 112028027: 4, 106930624: 4, 108149490: 4, 13364: 4, 112404909: 4, 106405973: 4, 107226876: 4, 112846784: 4, 106586290: 4, 106967283: 4, 106388711: 4, 112134112: 4, 106125724: 4, 106441684: 4, 106714751: 4, 106163772: 4, 106168303: 4, 106116543: 4, 105927660: 4, 105922881: 4, 107699621: 4, 106011053: 4, 12227: 4, 10610: 4, 107166848: 4, 106726952: 4, 105898385: 4, 106524993: 4, 107240862: 4, 105811636: 4, 105906559: 4, 14212: 4, 106158148: 4, 108608330: 4, 107183979: 4, 106579529: 4, 106720416: 4, 106215535: 4, 107380441: 4, 107056968: 4, 107138006: 4, 106360234: 4, 106577584: 4, 107141348: 4, 107002071: 4, 10168: 4, 107377680: 4, 200105825: 3, 110327172: 3, 106936938: 3, 109130361: 3, 107078738: 3, 111841723: 3, 109411750: 3, 109884427: 3, 106780317: 3, 105943577: 3}"

The following is a more recent description that Cris Magness recently posted on a Forum whose topic was exactly that, i.e. doing only the first 2 pitches:                                                             Not 5.4!  5.6, good, worthwhile, and runout. I updated the anchor at the block on top of pitch one several years back, the anchor below the chimney is modern as well.  You'll clip an old (suspect) mid-point anchor halfway through the 5.6 pitch.  Gear is sporadic, both leader and follower should be competent at the grade as the climb traverses quite a bit.  1) Start as per Toe Crack or Standard Direct.  Move through the belay for Toe Crack and up to a block and bolted anchor on the right.  5.5 or 5.9.  2) Follow the obvious dike past a midpoint anchor on the left until the angle steepens.  160'.  5.6.  Tricams may help.  Have two ropes for the rappel, it's a free-hanging adventure down the Mordor Wall RHall, NH Admin. ","{105943577: 4, 107494185: 4, 109086735: 3, 106178530: 2, 106168303: 2, 107064260: 2, 105084340: 2}"

Find your way to the two bolt anchor for windfall. One can climb Thinner, Windfall, Freedom, Pro Choice, Turners Flake or Toe Crack to approach. I find that Freedom or windfall are the best as it makes for a very consistent link up grade wise.    From the anchor, move up and right over some considerably runout 5.easy terrain, aiming for a crack that leads to the unmistakable yellow roofs. There are several pins hidden behind flakes in this area. Depending on where you wonder you may come across them.         Clip a pin at the start of the crack and move up into the first small roof. Pull this (the crux of ML), and aim for the left end of the large roofs on the right. Reach over and clip the bolt, traverse a hair right and pull the roof on some of the most atypical moves you'll find at Cathedral.

Standard Route,105949237.0,Trad,105908831.0,5.7,350.0,4.0,1.9,56.0,"A bold route for the times... Very typical of the climbs that were popular around this time, following a line with trees and other natural options for protection such as boulders and threads... The crux however is still not well protected even now with our modern gear...   Since it was done in the early 30's you might say it could be a good beginner trad route but it doesn't lend itself to safety for the less experienced climber... Loose rock, run outs, and awkward moves are all things that might make for an epic if you are not well practiced... That being said i would recommend doing Thin Air, Fun House to Upper Refuse, and a few slab routes before this one... But thats just me...    Pitch 1:(5.5) Start up the right leaning ramp as for Turners Flake (5.8) and continue right to the to the base of Toe Crack, the moves stepping right are tricky but not hard once you get it... Belay from Here...    Pitch2: Head right and in to the chimney... Follow the chimney up past a chockstone to a fixed belay in the cave... Fun chimney climbing...    Pitch 3: (5.7+ R) This is the R crux section, take a deep breath and be cool... climb up the right hand wall (5.6 R) making some hard for the grade moves to clip a fixed sling, what a relief, you are safe... After this you continue up the chimney on easier climbing to a tree belay (watch out for loose rocks)...    Pitch 4: (5.5) Follow the gully to the top (this part is a little less classic and dirty from what i remember but its been a few years).. From the top walk to the right or hitch hike down...    A great climb of this type but bring your spirit of adventure... have fun...

Thinner,105948491.0,Trad,105908831.0,5.8,0.0,1.0,2.7,24.0,"Due to a cool head and good judgment, there are few times in my climbing career that I have truly thought that I might die...My first lead of this route is one of the elite few.... My belayer never knew it, but inside I thought I was about to take the screamer of a life time...But let's take a step back shall we....    After locating the right-facing corner left of Turner's Flake, climb the face up to it and follow nice moves up the corner and on the face to the left with decent protection.... At this point I'm saying to my self ""R rated? Whatever, the pro seems pretty good"" eventually you clip a pin and the corner runs out...And so do you...There is a place to protect maybe 10 feet above the pin though its a bit tricky, these days I might have used it a bit better, but I was somewhat new to trad climbing (it's a place where you can thread a nut or a very thin sling)....   At this point, it is a series of mantel moves like many of the routes on this wall...mantel after mantel and then you look down at how far you are above the last piece of marginal gear, wow.... This brings us back to the story....    I looked down at the pin which was the last good piece and did the math if I fell. I'd be going a very long way, and the good holds ran out.... I kept it cool and committed, but inside I was picturing the 70 foot fall I figured I'd take if i blew the move.... This image stayed with me as I moved up on the slippery crimps and a bad foot that started to slip as I lunged for the ledge....And stuck it.... I mantled up and took a deep breath, a dude at the Thin Air belay looked down with wide eyes and said ""wow, that was cool"".... ""Thanks"", I said masking my relief and looking like I do that all the time.... I set up the belay and got on with my day, but Thinner had left its mark and made me a wiser man....     I've done many sketchy routes since, but I go in to them with an understanding of what I'm getting in to.... I recommend you do the same....","{107997949: 4, 109212068: 4, 106720416: 3, 108266600: 3, 200041302: 3, 105898385: 3, 107494185: 3, 106990659: 3, 108252197: 3, 106579529: 3, 107126711: 3, 106215535: 3, 105906559: 3, 105945019: 3, 11115: 2, 106191055: 2, 105801390: 2, 106726952: 2, 109884416: 2, 105889415: 2, 110046547: 2, 109608840: 2, 105890157: 2, 106125724: 2}"
Toe Crack,105949212.0,Trad,105908831.0,5.7,100.0,2.0,3.4,264.0,"Though Toe Crack is not its own route it is done on its own more often than not so I figured I'd add it as a route.... It is actually the second pitch of Repulsion (5.8+) which is not too popular due to being a bit spicy.... If you are looking to climb a perfect 5.7 hand crack, Toe Crack is for you for sure...It is also one of the first cracks to dry after rain which adds to its allure....  Pitch 1: (5.5) Start on the ramp that leads up and right to Turner's Flake.... When you get under Turner's, step down and right (tricky at the grade) and over to a stance below the beautiful crack.... Belay from here or keep climbing but think of rope drag and your partners safety on the traverse move and protect accordingly....  Pitch 2: (5.7) Climb the crack for about 100ft. It doesn't get much finer at the grade.... a #3 cam is helpful and you may want a 3.5 if you are shaky at the grade...The jams are good and so are the feet, but the gear is a little weird in parts 'cause the crack isn't perfectly splitter.... Just look at your cams before you move on instead of stuffing them blindly (always a bad idea)....

Flip the righthand into an undercling above the starting hold before getting a left heelhook out left on a glassy rail. From here deadpoint off the heel to a glassy lefthand sidepull Once here execute some extremely difficult foot moves up onto the start. Stay tight in the scoop feature and make a very strenuous and friction dependent move up to a bad sloper.  If you come out of the box in this position you will lose the friction and spin-off the boulder, stepping or kicking the slab directly behind will prevent an awkward fall, but could potentially result in a bruised heel(this happened to me on my first session).  Once this sloper is latched properly with the righthand, match and set the left foot in order to make another long tenuous and precarious lock-off out left to a large juggy sidepull in the upper part of the crack. Stay tight and fight another barndoor to match before reaching up righthand to a large pocket. Once on this pocket get a high foot and lock-off all the way up and left to a large jug and the lip of the tall boulder.  This problem is slightly contrived because an easier exit out left exists(Sar-Chasm), but personally this problem, although very difficult, flows naturally and very well and also incorporates a lot of full-body tension and the constant fear of greasing-off of smooth and friction dependent holds similar to ""Stegasaurus"" and ""Lady Slipper"".  Sorry for the beta spray down, but the specific line of travel could be confusing otherwise. Climbing the first half of ""Sar-Chasm"" then heading back right to the sloper for the big lock-off to the crack while avoiding the intro of glassy sidepulls, underclings and heelhooks is not the same problem. That is more of a variation to Sar-chasm that does not flow well but ends with the same sloper lock-off.

The original problem & sequence is unaffected, however, it created another way to climb the wall. Before the break, an ascent of this problem was rare and it's safe to assume the original problem hasn't been climbed in a while. Original Problem (Hard V9) It starts sitting with a few holds in a low horizontal crack.  Once you stand up into the underclings, a very long and tenuous move straight up to a flat, half-pad crimper gets you going.  Get your left hand up to a small crimp on the left, then you have to use your technical prowess to tick-tack your feet and hands up...until you can gain the monster jug in the middle of the rock.  A mantle on this hold is needed to top out.  This is a great challenge of fingerstrength and footwork. The flake and foot jug out right never even come into play. New Wave Version (V8) The most obvious way to climb the problem. Start sitting in the crack, stand up into the underclings and grab the creaky flake. Continue through the crimps and stick a foot in the start hold of Jugs to reach the jug before topping out. If you choose to eschew the huge foot, it bumps the grade back to a soft V9.

Downclimb the slab for the dismount onto your pad.","{105943577: 4, 106306579: 4, 106702886: 4, 105913936: 4, 106990659: 4, 108082563: 4, 107346586: 4, 106967283: 4, 107773248: 4, 109273582: 4, 108948598: 4, 109676284: 4, 109683196: 4, 110317485: 4, 110282915: 4, 108742177: 4, 108362846: 4, 109405838: 4, 111357648: 4, 112187190: 4, 200057050: 4, 112166649: 4, 107505083: 4, 111344408: 4, 110970634: 4, 200088765: 4, 200370616: 4, 200063563: 4, 108181716: 4, 200451478: 4, 200054270: 4, 105832216: 4, 200368580: 4, 112166651: 4, 200316373: 4, 106928886: 3, 105906559: 3, 106590583: 3, 106716166: 3, 107665229: 3, 106239262: 3, 106971875: 3, 106103271: 3, 106434727: 3, 105941791: 3, 107256302: 3, 107492248: 3, 106709875: 3, 107896104: 3, 108222002: 3, 107555169: 3, 108961407: 3, 108765178: 3, 106538248: 3, 108358921: 3, 108257055: 3, 109008277: 3, 106441684: 3, 108425859: 3, 108454711: 3, 108910397: 3, 106358364: 3, 110522591: 3, 108105911: 3, 109648338: 3, 107723439: 3, 110327172: 3, 109467833: 3, 111760876: 3, 111072333: 3, 108076563: 3, 110259196: 3, 109182219: 3, 107009084: 3, 111265335: 3, 110989228: 3, 112334063: 3, 112858279: 3, 200246240: 3, 112207022: 3, 200385604: 3, 110181635: 3, 109369300: 3, 108301940: 3, 200438788: 3, 110762698: 3, 111928487: 3, 200078447: 3, 107928271: 3, 200320869: 3, 108437225: 3, 200459607: 3, 106917454: 3, 200314088: 3, 111783002: 3, 106908052: 2, 107183486: 2, 106978267: 2, 111204599: 2, 108026348: 2, 111744118: 2, 107739229: 2, 111397499: 2, 106554217: 2, 109328345: 2, 107085584: 2, 111841723: 2, 113437089: 2, 106054402: 2, 200415949: 2, 200679656: 2, 106125724: 1}"

Overlooked,105945306.0,Boulder,105945303.0,V4,0.0,1.0,3.8,184.0,After bouldering all across the country this remains perhaps my very favorite problem. It is both technical and powerful and involves a greater variety of holds and movements than most boulders.    An amazing boulder problem involving crazy beta and full body fitness. Start under the lowest roof in the back of the cave on two hueco pockets in the roof with fairly poor feet but they are there. A few choices here but most people end up in a bat-hang in the wide crack then switch to a heel-toe-cam and make a cool move to the lip of the roof.

At the top, follow cracks to the clips.","{108416778: 4, 105906559: 3, 106028942: 3, 105898385: 3, 106399334: 3, 106074233: 3, 106097553: 3, 106469016: 3, 106600250: 3, 106844475: 3, 106822110: 3, 107291614: 3, 107409057: 3, 108375710: 3, 109596410: 3, 110422975: 3, 111136212: 3, 111031033: 3, 111136253: 3, 110900446: 3, 111888705: 3, 106741672: 3, 112134885: 3, 200096929: 3, 200197044: 3, 200256906: 3, 200211580: 3, 108375637: 3, 112460885: 3, 200064270: 3, 200464516: 3, 112134112: 3, 200574897: 3, 200498039: 3, 200875943: 3, 200640686: 3, 107540375: 2, 107552617: 2, 107493129: 2, 106917454: 2, 105832216: 2, 10186: 2, 107594314: 2, 106868421: 2, 107702396: 2, 105990845: 2, 105961696: 2, 105969895: 2, 107782738: 2, 106117267: 2, 106207073: 2, 105980259: 2, 106020029: 2, 106113062: 2, 106125724: 2, 106549436: 2, 106592409: 2, 106590583: 2, 106726952: 2, 106767622: 2, 106718918: 2, 106740419: 2, 105941791: 2, 105890157: 2, 105941782: 2, 106103271: 2, 107336862: 2, 107723439: 2, 107898897: 2, 108145511: 2, 107085584: 2, 108134066: 2, 108193208: 2, 108011499: 2, 108273975: 2, 108244717: 2, 107630444: 2, 108323817: 2, 108307042: 2, 106360234: 2, 106773417: 2, 107852661: 2, 107698881: 2, 107178254: 2, 106876126: 2, 108736383: 2, 107768989: 2, 108590756: 2, 108867086: 2, 108252197: 2, 106561728: 2, 109090119: 2, 108245758: 2, 109410883: 2, 109230273: 2, 108652563: 2, 110185189: 2, 108189638: 2, 107074658: 2, 108463738: 2, 110619029: 2, 110307786: 2, 110863417: 2, 108367353: 2, 109268194: 2, 109135839: 2, 106407009: 2, 109193524: 2, 109136692: 2, 108290010: 2, 111682044: 2, 110317485: 2, 110363121: 2, 106778019: 2, 108257055: 2, 111970633: 2, 112100767: 2, 112118431: 2, 111917126: 2, 111357648: 2, 108478944: 2, 111796230: 2, 107346586: 2, 106990659: 2, 112126639: 2, 110762698: 2, 112357071: 2, 112041389: 2, 110428233: 2, 109383300: 2, 108985245: 2, 111854408: 2, 200074903: 2, 200078875: 2, 113317393: 2, 112312149: 2, 200101052: 2, 107873850: 2, 109324282: 2, 200145895: 2, 110989228: 2, 110340063: 2, 111969490: 2, 107473980: 2, 110956309: 2, 107385412: 2, 110645674: 2, 111118747: 2, 109077850: 2, 200078397: 2, 112042073: 2, 200312793: 2, 200264338: 2, 112166651: 2, 112038160: 2, 200000618: 2, 200041302: 2, 200074424: 2, 200063563: 2, 111810451: 2, 111626403: 2, 200129067: 2, 111119242: 2, 200281228: 2, 200265615: 2, 113228520: 2, 200334316: 2, 106191055: 2, 111203516: 2, 200145579: 2, 107769173: 2, 113077522: 2, 200168968: 2, 200409226: 2, 108100269: 2, 200297969: 2, 200469947: 2, 200704601: 2, 200337611: 2, 200428404: 2, 108276959: 2, 200671914: 2, 107851075: 2, 200267777: 2, 106397425: 1, 106706501: 1, 105839151: 1, 107247400: 1, 105913936: 1, 106075659: 1, 107430471: 1, 106306579: 1, 106751248: 1, 106417094: 1, 106860562: 1, 106971875: 1, 106928959: 1, 106916096: 1, 106434727: 1, 107555169: 1, 107740836: 1, 108168761: 1, 106134707: 1, 108595560: 1, 108157281: 1, 107682885: 1, 107169450: 1, 108159370: 1, 109052547: 1, 109856888: 1, 107917066: 1, 106967283: 1, 110138155: 1, 108188495: 1, 111546553: 1, 108727186: 1, 111968804: 1, 111914048: 1, 108179890: 1, 108436633: 1, 107373999: 1, 109634899: 1, 110409351: 1, 113164188: 1, 111169936: 1, 111610436: 1, 200095422: 1, 106679659: 1, 111916761: 1, 109568693: 1, 200105953: 1, 109017895: 1, 110062671: 1, 112050804: 1, 200220295: 1, 110756813: 1, 109414386: 1, 111844655: 1, 110942549: 1, 106180018: 1, 200286421: 1, 110923255: 1, 105970716: 1, 200086388: 1, 200430991: 1, 200160054: 1, 200855703: 1, 110122418: 1, 200403371: 1, 200244148: 1, 200678844: 1, 200784449: 1, 108048090: 1, 106358364: 0, 106901918: 0, 107839581: 0, 106662131: 0, 108276722: 0}"

Most people toprope it, and it's probably a good thing because not everyone has the skills and cool head that is required to climb a hard R rated route like this. I worked it out on toprope first, then led it with one piece of gear (a purple TCU) and a few draws for the bolts at the top. I hear the TCU is bomber, but I don't wish to test it.     Starting to the right of the classic, Romancing the Stone (5.10c), climb the face on tiny crimps eventually meeting up with Romancing at its right trending traverse, at which point you will have some bolts to clip.

Fun climbing leads to a confounding crux that most people solve by moving left and using a few holds on the corner. If you climb this section directly, it might bump up the grade a smidge. But it is more fun to do it at 5.9. The crux involves a big move to an incut crimp that is often tick-marked.     Being the only 5.9 at the crag, it is also the best 5.9 at the crag so make sure you climb it.

This climb is fun even in the mossy conditions. Without the moss the holds can seem sharp because it is a newer route. There is no defined crux but as the route is now the crux would be dealing with the mossy holds. This route could be close to the same quality as A Week With Pete with just a little bit of love, I am going to try to clean this line once the ice melts off of it.

The climbing is interesting and exciting, and the gear is good enough where you need it. I think it is more PG13 than R, but the guidebook says R due to a recorded ground fall, so I will too. It's not as scary as Blue Balls at Christmas.     So, you follow interesting moves up a flake and out left to a letter box slot (protect with TCU) climbing to the crux in the upper third of the route. A pretty big move to a good crimpy hold with a small(I use a #7 stopper I think) but solid nut at your waist. You can prolly get away with smaller crimpy moves too.

The start is a little vegetated, but it's not too bad.  Climb the dirty corner past a couple of bolts and a pin (back up with a medium stopper).  From the pin, make some awkward moves up on to a large, flat ledge and clip the next bolt.  Continue straight up the slightly overhanging headwall.  The crux is clipping the bolt at the top of the headwall (if you blow the clip, you'll hit the ledge).  Mantle through a couple more awkward ledges and then work right to the anchors.  Strange climb, but worthwhile.","{108867086: 4, 108990414: 3, 106967283: 3, 106957265: 3, 110259196: 3, 106741672: 3, 110762698: 3, 112810423: 3, 200096522: 3, 200122335: 3, 200071291: 3, 111837902: 3, 111810534: 3, 110923255: 3, 200253285: 3, 200337611: 3, 10186: 2, 106306579: 2, 106971875: 2, 108222002: 2, 105959323: 2, 105913936: 2, 107768989: 2, 107712333: 2, 109444514: 2, 109090119: 2, 108245758: 2, 108200547: 2, 107739229: 2, 109052547: 2, 108436633: 2, 109648338: 2, 107852661: 2, 108167720: 2, 111136212: 2, 106917454: 2, 107851075: 2, 112010408: 2, 111854408: 2, 111970633: 2, 111087111: 2, 106990659: 2, 110428233: 2, 110211008: 2, 108324210: 2, 200074903: 2, 200078875: 2, 200054289: 2, 110315255: 2, 109017895: 2, 200220295: 2, 200259729: 2, 111626403: 2, 110452119: 2, 200101052: 2, 110807699: 2, 112340080: 2, 200286421: 2, 106561728: 2, 106858324: 2, 200581858: 2, 106928959: 2, 200246542: 2, 200434459: 2, 105832216: 2, 112042073: 2, 200678844: 2, 200640686: 2, 107108243: 2, 200267777: 2, 105906559: 1, 105961696: 1, 105839151: 1, 106075659: 1, 107740836: 1, 106280222: 1, 105898385: 1, 106134707: 1, 106113062: 1, 106358364: 1, 106397425: 1, 107985789: 1, 108110667: 1, 106586268: 1, 106868421: 1, 110396471: 1, 107477790: 1, 110856294: 1, 107126711: 1, 108188495: 1, 108257055: 1, 110813639: 1, 110317485: 1, 111875474: 1, 112050112: 1, 112926469: 1, 111825461: 1, 200155809: 1, 111657384: 1, 111841723: 1, 112166651: 1, 106646308: 1, 105970716: 1, 106191055: 1, 107388687: 1, 200840998: 1, 200634716: 1, 112401943: 1, 106901918: 0, 106028942: 0, 108137876: 0, 108595560: 0, 200125380: 0}"

The crux is thin face climbing just past the first bolt (which is a little easier if you use holds off to the right of the bolt line).  Sustained climbing past three more bolts leads to the anchors.

Move quickly and fight the pump, because you need to make a move to the right to gain a crimpy face and it can be a pumpy experience if you wear out your arms on the first section. On the top section, sequence is important so plan ahead.","{106389004: 4, 106494505: 4, 105906559: 4, 12345: 4, 105886022: 4, 105839151: 4, 105879342: 4, 105981136: 4, 106971875: 4, 107816997: 4, 106103271: 4, 106139012: 4, 106716166: 4, 107102487: 4, 105898385: 4, 106876126: 4, 105938601: 4, 106361272: 4, 105895298: 4, 106031999: 4, 106486112: 4, 106702886: 4, 106710887: 4, 106558490: 4, 106860568: 4, 106670299: 4, 107969579: 4, 107222279: 4, 107921774: 4, 106922041: 4, 106360234: 4, 107214214: 4, 107046125: 4, 106397425: 4, 108145511: 4, 108245758: 4, 105913936: 4, 106449525: 4, 107852661: 4, 107492957: 4, 106538248: 4, 106536458: 4, 108832516: 4, 108276722: 4, 107226876: 4, 108222002: 4, 109371843: 4, 110365118: 4, 107801617: 4, 109648338: 4, 112025952: 4, 110262256: 4, 112077176: 4, 111181604: 4, 107346586: 4, 110668667: 4, 111741206: 4, 106890179: 4, 111902978: 4, 108121411: 4, 111278312: 4, 112549869: 4, 110293668: 4, 111822624: 4, 111882861: 4, 107602549: 4, 109585594: 4, 106075659: 4, 107183979: 4, 200148250: 4, 200154910: 4, 200150489: 4, 112166651: 4, 111142184: 4, 107711888: 4, 112322643: 4, 200374248: 4, 106868421: 4, 200316373: 4, 106985791: 4, 111546553: 4, 112439618: 4, 200119240: 4, 200234196: 4, 200079239: 4, 200372430: 4, 200278987: 4, 110262051: 4, 200248105: 4, 200060911: 4, 7073220: 4, 110712867: 4, 113460078: 4, 200325236: 4, 111443138: 4, 200040702: 4, 106957265: 4, 109255473: 4, 110689679: 4, 108747074: 4, 106189019: 4, 200743333: 4, 108981414: 4, 107655644: 3, 10610: 3, 105927660: 3, 106024037: 3, 105963968: 3, 106011053: 3, 106347294: 3, 105832216: 3, 105970326: 3, 106440358: 3, 106125724: 3, 106271741: 3, 105890157: 3, 106054402: 3, 106561728: 3, 107126711: 3, 105885115: 3, 107544240: 3, 108181716: 3, 108266600: 3, 107232890: 3, 107739229: 3, 109856891: 3, 106108710: 3, 108362846: 3, 110970484: 3, 108290010: 3, 107941619: 3, 106897206: 3, 107009084: 3, 108742211: 3, 110294685: 3, 109230273: 3, 111414778: 3, 109328345: 3, 108364795: 3, 107260705: 3, 110750765: 3, 113237721: 3, 111066391: 3, 108625148: 3, 107085584: 3, 200057419: 3, 112375922: 3, 106967283: 3, 107891721: 3, 108529353: 3, 110172496: 3, 200074903: 3, 111488411: 3, 106646308: 3, 110446085: 3, 200227584: 3, 200381053: 3, 108943993: 3, 111364728: 3, 106191055: 3, 109638995: 3, 107108243: 3, 109317339: 3, 200253783: 3, 109467833: 3, 110762698: 3, 108200547: 3, 106861455: 2, 106206960: 2, 105885105: 2, 105959323: 2, 108418446: 2, 109392078: 2, 111779200: 2, 108827034: 2, 109393254: 2, 108032974: 2, 109884427: 2, 111841723: 2, 109692317: 2, 106146571: 2, 107851075: 2, 105943577: 1}"

They Come and They Go,106932264.0,Trad,105908754.0,5.6,110.0,2.0,0.5,2.0,"Climb right side of off width by a tricky move up right that's not actually in the off width crack. After mounting ledge move further right to head back left to off width to do another tricky move to gain decent foot ledges. Above this is a small oak tree in the off width dirt now. Standing on the outside edges move up and clip tree. Go left onto knobby face and run it out to a bolt (5.4). At bolt moving left carefully on blocks is easiest way up here and awkward. Climb has gotten very lichen dirty now, move right up past bolt to small diagonal downward facing corner to move up to reach a 2 bolt belay. Climb filthy rock for 70ft with 2 protection anchors (5.2) to trees and rappel back to the bolt belay. Nice view and a very large, very dirty slab. There are fragrant ferns in this area that can be easily avoided.","{106178530: 1, 106967283: 0}"
The Anchovy Caper,106148899.0,Sport,105935079.0,5.8,0.0,1.0,2.0,205.0,Another nice recent addition to the area. The climbing on the slabby section is technical and thought provoking. The bottom is the crux for most (unless the trees are used for feet).    Start up the face between the trees on sidepulls and crimps till you can gain the lower angle face above. Continue following the bolts while you smear and layback your way past good flakes on the left to the top. This upper part is very fun if you like that kind of stuff. ,"{106679659: 4, 111916761: 4, 106916096: 3, 106764476: 3, 107688321: 3, 105913936: 3, 106413328: 3, 106306579: 3, 106590583: 3, 106399472: 3, 106869562: 3, 106971875: 3, 106860562: 3, 108240824: 3, 107492957: 3, 109121905: 3, 109387493: 3, 107787060: 3, 108547663: 3, 109006073: 3, 110756813: 3, 110638625: 3, 107763339: 3, 109324282: 3, 110705741: 3, 110363121: 3, 106778019: 3, 108116238: 3, 106990659: 3, 112038160: 3, 110762698: 3, 111956051: 3, 112064732: 3, 200038840: 3, 112210382: 3, 200081629: 3, 108375637: 3, 111626403: 3, 107253738: 3, 200314873: 3, 200253316: 3, 200498039: 3, 112211778: 3, 106822110: 2, 107532062: 2, 107126711: 2, 106928886: 2, 106397425: 2, 106486112: 2, 105906559: 2, 107740836: 2, 107852661: 2, 106561728: 2, 106103271: 2, 106868421: 2, 106358364: 2, 105885115: 2, 105890157: 2, 106125724: 2, 106576182: 2, 106434727: 2, 107347295: 2, 106860568: 2, 108093743: 2, 106312507: 2, 108193208: 2, 108307042: 2, 108188495: 2, 108324210: 2, 107346586: 2, 107430471: 2, 106538248: 2, 108145511: 2, 106876126: 2, 109032615: 2, 106917454: 2, 109107529: 2, 108245630: 2, 108608330: 2, 109337092: 2, 108622889: 2, 108436633: 2, 108110667: 2, 109523045: 2, 109268194: 2, 108245758: 2, 109638995: 2, 109272253: 2, 106967283: 2, 107107345: 2, 108048090: 2, 110428233: 2, 109454067: 2, 108189638: 2, 106662131: 2, 110842632: 2, 110863417: 2, 110317485: 2, 109135839: 2, 110522591: 2, 111142184: 2, 110138155: 2, 107851075: 2, 111844655: 2, 111902978: 2, 111909917: 2, 111968804: 2, 108282189: 2, 111974624: 2, 111344408: 2, 108473722: 2, 109052547: 2, 110580188: 2, 111546553: 2, 112045434: 2, 112164950: 2, 111357648: 2, 112169001: 2, 111857342: 2, 111031033: 2, 108222002: 2, 112324365: 2, 111066391: 2, 112174305: 2, 112030796: 2, 107494185: 2, 111333328: 2, 111980551: 2, 112365589: 2, 111825461: 2, 110262256: 2, 200056643: 2, 111888281: 2, 200074903: 2, 110315255: 2, 200078875: 2, 200101052: 2, 110341322: 2, 111610436: 2, 111700011: 2, 109932626: 2, 200105825: 2, 111004308: 2, 112166651: 2, 200063563: 2, 109169640: 2, 110454201: 2, 112042073: 2, 110452119: 2, 109269951: 2, 200160054: 2, 200249961: 2, 200064270: 2, 111782967: 2, 106191055: 2, 111203516: 2, 112207022: 2, 106957265: 2, 200145579: 2, 200299011: 2, 200690144: 2, 200604841: 2, 200297969: 2, 107085584: 2, 200840998: 2, 106702886: 1, 106928959: 1, 106134707: 1, 107512961: 1, 107878732: 1, 106205646: 1, 106577584: 1, 107839581: 1, 106239262: 1, 108711756: 1, 108148725: 1, 108244717: 1, 108200547: 1, 107739229: 1, 110671153: 1, 110724330: 1, 108652563: 1, 106251687: 1, 109645277: 1, 110856294: 1, 109505100: 1, 110923255: 1, 111081279: 1, 112153448: 1, 112187190: 1, 107820434: 1, 108985245: 1, 109692317: 1, 111181604: 1, 111921737: 1, 111841723: 1, 106440310: 1, 200143597: 1, 112134112: 1, 110591893: 1, 111650569: 1, 107222279: 1, 106578430: 1, 106744764: 0}"
"Armed and Dangerous, and Off My Medication",105935097.0,Sport,105935079.0,5.10b,0.0,1.0,3.5,700.0,"A Rumney classic that deserves a spot on every 5.10 climbers tick list. Most commonly referred to as just ""Armed and Dangerous"" minus the long-winded, second half of the name, it is the center piece of its crag and for good reason. Varied climbing from technical, slabby, face climbing to a super cool, steep, jug haul that can give some exposure for its relatively small size. If you pump out, fear not the falls are all air as you climb out the intimidating exit moves.    To the right of the start of Cereal Killer (5.11c, which climbs out of the cave at the cliff base) you will start up easier rock to a line of bolts on a slab surmounting a few bulges these moves, not the steeps at the top are the true crux of the route. At the top of the slab, take a rest and look up at the looming steepness. Move quickly through this part, as it can sap one's energy fast. After the steep stuff is over, good holds lead up and left to anchors.     Armed and Dangerous tends to dry quickly so most non-rainy days it is in good condition.    The very top of the climb has been changed to make room for another route to the right. This doesn't take away from the route's quality and its new neighbor is yet another fun 5.10.","{106928886: 4, 106397425: 4, 107628457: 4, 106876126: 4, 105906559: 4, 105879342: 4, 105943577: 4,

When I climbed it I picked every hold wrong and it felt mid 5.10 but I looked at it on the way down and it wouldn't have been too hard with the right sequence. A good onsight challenge at the grade.    Start on low angle rock clipping a couple bolts on the way to the roof. Make strenuous moves through the roof hoping to hit the good holds the first time. After pulling the lip it eases off to very moderate but enjoyable climbing to the quick clip anchors.,"{108416778: 4, 111716091: 4, 107232890: 4, 200267777: 4, 106764476: 3, 107419765: 3, 108990414: 3, 107852661: 3, 108157281: 3, 110456388: 3, 109410883: 3, 110522591: 3, 110728444: 3, 110259196: 3, 107373999: 3, 109737113: 3, 106990659: 3, 112365589: 3, 106793247: 3, 112210382: 3, 111167972: 3, 112926469: 3, 200044458: 3, 200155809: 3, 112834425: 3, 111928487: 3, 111357648: 3, 111825461: 3, 200187183: 3, 111779719: 3, 200259729: 3, 200067404: 3, 111573930: 3, 200101052: 3, 111626403: 3, 111546553: 3, 110530156: 3, 200168968: 3, 200482542: 3, 110262051: 3, 200458015: 3, 200278987: 3, 200040702: 3, 200462592: 3, 200635915: 3, 200743333: 3, 200462073: 3, 200337611: 3, 200124208: 3, 106486112: 2, 105890157: 2, 106876126: 2, 106590583: 2, 106868421: 2, 106434727: 2, 108257055: 2, 108933008: 2, 109101477: 2, 105913936: 2, 106449525: 2, 108202763: 2, 106358364: 2, 106306579: 2, 108178915: 2, 107739229: 2, 108245758: 2, 109269951: 2, 106662131: 2, 107632893: 2, 108652563: 2, 110317485: 2, 110262256: 2, 106647777: 2, 108222002: 2, 108323817: 2, 111902978: 2, 107851075: 2, 108290010: 2, 109505100: 2, 112010408: 2, 108473722: 2, 109692317: 2, 108200547: 2, 109483250: 2, 107346586: 2, 112324365: 2, 108032974: 2, 111666789: 2, 110580188: 2, 106210225: 2, 107085584: 2, 200101883: 2, 111278312: 2, 107494185: 2, 111169936: 2, 111181604: 2, 105943577: 2, 200064120: 2, 200074903: 2, 200078875: 2, 110878282: 2, 109017895: 2, 112042073: 2, 110762698: 2, 105960152: 2, 112134112: 2, 112810423: 2, 112172937: 2, 200157044: 2, 112322643: 2, 200071451: 2, 108981414: 2, 112038160: 2, 200196315: 2, 110454201: 2, 112286747: 2, 200290850: 2, 112166651: 2, 107768989: 2, 112354371: 2, 200375360: 2, 200292349: 2, 200374248: 2, 111844655: 2, 106180018: 2, 110985244: 2, 200490925: 2, 109020715: 2, 107469778: 2, 112091216: 2, 110712867: 2, 200524014: 2, 112142591: 2, 111650569: 2, 106191055: 2, 112207022: 2, 200602398: 2, 200265615: 2, 200063563: 2, 106971875: 2, 110923255: 2, 200690144: 2, 200395157: 2, 106965842: 2, 200723727: 2, 108093743: 2, 110340063: 2, 200825839: 2, 200840998: 2, 106957265: 2, 110591893: 2, 200309821: 2, 200711420: 2, 105906559: 1, 106561728: 1, 105885115: 1, 106397425: 1, 106967283: 1, 108252197: 1, 111142184: 1, 111656243: 1, 111841723: 1, 108747074: 1, 110900723: 1, 111921737: 1, 109932626: 1, 200296165: 1, 200154262: 1, 200469253: 1, 200169513: 1, 7128541: 1}"

Slack's second pitch goes up and right through a break in the wall. We climbed up and left, under the ceiling past a small tree (please don't cut the tree off) and far left go up, directly left is the ramp with pin then a bolt. Three pins, up the right facing corner, reach over the corner at the block flake, and carefully mantle onto the traverse ledge to a nice belay spot in the blocks above the cliff. Rope drag was almost too much. Better to break it up, into two pitches.  from the ceiling protection. Not much can be done about that. The climb goes up on quartzite. It's a fixer upper meaning add bolts as eventually remove pins. It's on main cliff and obscure as climbs get. It's a nice addition to my Rumney ascents.",{106178530: 2}
The Big Easy,106052151.0,Sport,105935079.0,5.7,0.0,2.0,2.6,282.0,"This is a link up that combines new and borrowed parts of older routes, resulting in a three pitch 5.8+ that goes the full height of the cliff.    Pitch one: is a fun ramble up moderate (5.7)rock. The first few moves will make you look like a super star without too much effort thanks to the super jugs on the steep rock. A few interesting moves after that but mostly jug hauling to a nice ledge with an anchor. Most people lower off from here for a nice single pitch sport route. If continuing above, you can combine  this with the next, short pitch, or stop here and combine the next two.    Pitch two: From the ledge, head up and left through a notch at about 5.7, then continue angling left on easier ground to the Sesame Street anchor (this pitch is short but has few cool moves) The bolts leading straight up after the notch rather than heading over to the anchors is an alternative pitch Bourbon Street' that goes at 5.10c.    Pitch three: From the Sesame anchors continue directly up a corner and easy (5.4) eyebolt protected ground to a bolted anchor. This pitch is pleasant, but it was never fully cleaned, so be aware of a large, potentially loose rock on the side and that you are probably climbing above people who can't see you. If you are going to continue up the next, trad pitch, The White Buttress, 5.9, you may want to continue above the bolted anchors and belay from a tree.    Pitch four: See the description for The White Buttress.    Getting down: From the pitch one anchor at the ledge, you can lower with a 60m rope. From the 2nd or 3rd pitches you will need to do a couple raps, but be very aware of people below and knocking stuff down on them. If you go all the way to the top of the White Buttress it is best to hike down. If you walk a bit back you will run into the Overland trail. Right (safest but longer)takes you over to Orange Crush in a minute where you can follow the trail down. Left crosses the seasonal stream that forms the Venus Falls. If you cross it and follow it down a little, you can scramble down to the right above and then down the edge of the Venus Wall (exposed) This is fastest, but not suggested unless you have already come up that way and know your way around. Screw up and you can easily come down too fast.","{106764476: 4, 107740836: 4, 108990661: 4, 108245758: 4, 108547663: 4, 107901211: 4, 109136692: 4, 111350357: 4, 109017895: 4, 108181716: 4, 200274695: 4, 200450654: 4, 200107036: 4, 112091216: 4, 200574897: 4, 200564551: 4, 200297969: 4, 105963968: 3, 107107763: 3, 106239262: 3, 107688321: 3, 106306579: 3, 106358364: 3, 106134707: 3, 106590583: 3, 106486112: 3, 105943577: 3, 106358784: 3, 106701857: 3, 106125724: 3, 105890157: 3, 106860568: 3, 106876126: 3, 107257835: 3, 107852661: 3, 107870857: 3, 108222002: 3, 108188495: 3, 108157281: 3, 108551353: 3, 109014097: 3, 108736383: 3, 108462136: 3, 107653700: 3, 109337092: 3, 108244717: 3, 108652563: 3, 109444514: 3, 108335441: 3, 109073630: 3, 107373999: 3, 109586477: 3, 110185189: 3, 107739229: 3, 108189638: 3, 108323817: 3, 108276722: 3, 109135839: 3, 106967283: 3, 110330190: 3, 109193524: 3, 109645277: 3, 111779719: 3, 111136253: 3, 107985832: 3, 111281190: 3, 111902978: 3, 111546553: 3, 106193141: 3, 110462676: 3, 111682044: 3, 110155662: 3, 108178915: 3, 106741672: 3, 110705741: 3, 111468613: 3, 112212229: 3, 106990659: 3, 109383300: 3, 109324282: 3, 108802410: 3, 110762698: 3, 110317485: 3, 108162192: 3, 200061302: 3, 112115244: 3, 112365589: 3, 107085584: 3, 111744116: 3, 112174305: 3, 200076100: 3, 111278312: 3, 106679659: 3, 111169936: 3, 200074903: 3, 200122335: 3, 200151702: 3, 200099370: 3, 200151025: 3, 109268194: 3, 112050804: 3, 111657384: 3, 200242670: 3, 110274904: 3, 200154540: 3, 112042073: 3, 111825461: 3, 112192174: 3, 112172937: 3, 109157864: 3, 200105825: 3, 200312793: 3, 200324531: 3, 110756813: 3, 109526908: 3, 200134202: 3, 200101052: 3, 200063563: 3, 111626403: 3, 107691094: 3, 200437181: 3, 200445602: 3, 200056643: 3, 200249961: 3, 109020715: 3, 200534596: 3, 110923255: 3, 110262051: 3, 110452119: 3, 200581161: 3, 200395157: 3, 112207022: 3, 106191055: 3, 200281875: 3, 200561340: 3, 106407009: 3, 200314873: 3, 200591925: 3, 200430991: 3, 200160054: 3, 200392328: 3, 200584602: 3, 200416944: 3, 200069147: 3, 200129067: 3, 112401943: 3, 107232890: 3, 200174198: 3, 107838260: 3, 200711420: 3, 200469646: 3, 200494724: 3, 200483169: 3, 106822110: 2, 107119375: 2, 106075659: 2, 105906559: 2, 105832216: 2, 107430471: 2, 105898385: 2, 106347294: 2, 105885115: 2, 106103271: 2, 106814605: 2, 106784159: 2, 106699022: 2, 106971875: 2, 106860562: 2, 106868421: 2, 106957265: 2, 108096611: 2, 107555169: 2, 106397425: 2, 106743355: 2, 108193208: 2, 108217726: 2, 106417094: 2, 107630444: 2, 106928886: 2, 105913936: 2, 107529337: 2, 108011499: 2, 107604975: 2, 109101477: 2, 107768989: 2, 108867086: 2, 108249148: 2, 106554217: 2, 106586268: 2, 106953219: 2, 106879280: 2, 109272253: 2, 109483250: 2, 109692317: 2, 107477790: 2, 109711410: 2, 110724330: 2, 108200547: 2, 109006252: 2, 106647777: 2, 106567319: 2, 109525599: 2, 107492957: 2, 107763339: 2, 111142184: 2, 109269951: 2, 108245344: 2, 106662131: 2, 106917454: 2, 105938601: 2, 111783002: 2, 111700905: 2, 107851075: 2, 111344408: 2, 112166651: 2, 111796230: 2, 106793247: 2, 110631955: 2, 111844655: 2, 108985245: 2, 108436633: 2, 110900723: 2, 111610436: 2, 108557813: 2, 112255797: 2, 109737113: 2, 111921737: 2, 111980551: 2, 111882861: 2, 111277314: 2, 110580188: 2, 107346586: 2, 108693865: 2, 112116113: 2, 200038144: 2, 200078875: 2, 106440310: 2, 200162440: 2, 111700011: 2, 200181132: 2, 200265615: 2, 107830036: 2, 111970633: 2, 106339890: 2, 109467833: 2, 200125380: 2, 109506162: 2, 200143597: 2, 106484669: 2, 112340080: 2, 200264338: 2, 200374248: 2, 200475660: 2, 200485328: 2, 7073220: 2, 110712867: 2, 108137766: 2, 200213938: 2, 108473722: 2, 111203516: 2, 200469253: 2, 109406130: 2, 200855703: 2, 200815206: 2, 108093743: 2, 200253316: 2, 200825839: 2, 110591893: 2, 106205646: 1, 107682885: 1, 105816622: 1, 109856891: 1, 110671153: 1, 110454932: 1, 111081279: 1, 111841723: 1, 111777806: 1, 112096893: 1, 111716091: 1, 109393254: 1, 200168968: 1}"

Instead of angling over left to the the Sesame Street anchors, continue straight up the right hand line of bolts through a rock scar where the giant flat rock down in the trail below Arugala came from, to a tricky overlap where you must get up on to the final slab using some small and hard to locate holds and interesting footwork. Motor up to an anchor below the white buttress, passing lots of bolts for such an easy finish.

Big moves on good holds for the most part and nice clean falls.","{106397425: 4, 106876126: 4, 106842434: 4, 106108233: 4, 106922041: 4, 108087249: 4, 107214214: 4, 107346586: 4, 107742566: 4, 106616366: 4, 109101477: 4, 108759808: 4, 108245758: 4, 108195048: 4, 107842362: 4, 110970484: 4, 106647777: 4, 111142184: 4, 111909917: 4, 110259196: 4, 112332863: 4, 109581799: 4, 106895019: 4, 112092165: 4, 112935042: 4, 112810423: 4, 112574487: 4, 112365589: 4, 111777299: 4, 110980157: 4, 108948598: 4, 200067404: 4, 200105825: 4, 111092753: 4, 200051409: 4, 200292349: 4, 7073220: 4, 200381053: 4, 112013326: 4, 200416944: 4, 200906772: 4, 200475092: 4, 106928886: 3, 105890157: 3, 106716166: 3, 105906559: 3, 105943577: 3, 106239262: 3, 106075659: 3, 106577584: 3, 107512961: 3, 106124998: 3, 105898385: 3, 106413328: 3, 106378848: 3, 106031999: 3, 106230078: 3, 106347294: 3, 10610: 3, 106486112: 3, 106702886: 3, 106720416: 3, 106743707: 3, 105899901: 3, 106584542: 3, 106187478: 3, 106423391: 3, 105963968: 3, 107126711: 3, 105941782: 3, 106103271: 3, 107272204: 3, 106762873: 3, 107629487: 3, 107969579: 3, 107544240: 3, 105959323: 3, 107870857: 3, 107630444: 3, 106360234: 3, 105851541: 3, 108222002: 3, 108145511: 3, 108257055: 3, 108231303: 3, 108933008: 3, 108327537: 3, 106971875: 3, 107419765: 3, 105913936: 3, 107492957: 3, 107729640: 3, 108367150: 3, 107698881: 3, 105960152: 3, 107574666: 3, 109371843: 3, 107801617: 3, 106868421: 3, 108202763: 3, 108362846: 3, 109648338: 3, 106538248: 3, 106590583: 3, 106923378: 3, 108521517: 3, 109692317: 3, 110211008: 3, 108157281: 3, 110185189: 3, 107723931: 3, 109711410: 3, 109491966: 3, 107477790: 3, 106251687: 3, 108276722: 3, 110619029: 3, 106108710: 3, 111091265: 3, 108323817: 3, 106662131: 3, 105938601: 3, 109328345: 3, 107009084: 3, 111902978: 3, 108290010: 3, 107929356: 3, 111682044: 3, 107852661: 3, 112009148: 3, 110923255: 3, 108032974: 3, 109383300: 3, 108967041: 3, 108652563: 3, 107820617: 3, 112322643: 3, 112338943: 3, 110317485: 3, 110750765: 3, 111844655: 3, 107327535: 3, 110424351: 3, 109602213: 3, 111066391: 3, 110315426: 3, 111278312: 3, 109255473: 3, 111921737: 3, 113154763: 3, 108364795: 3, 112411512: 3, 112079214: 3, 200074903: 3, 200078875: 3, 200155809: 3, 200101052: 3, 112042073: 3, 107481755: 3, 106306579: 3, 111657384: 3, 111344408: 3, 111181604: 3, 112116113: 3, 111118747: 3, 109585594: 3, 107469778: 3, 200296165: 3, 112261455: 3, 112207022: 3, 112404909: 3, 108943993: 3, 107617264: 3, 110625617: 3, 200319558: 3, 200060331: 3, 200063563: 3, 111781359: 3, 106967283: 3, 111780243: 3, 107711888: 3, 107544688: 3, 107169450: 3, 108243919: 3, 200185447: 3, 112354371: 3, 106529776: 3, 200374248: 3, 106146571: 3, 200220515: 3, 111031033: 3, 112512394: 3, 110712867: 3, 200337119: 3, 200071451: 3, 110262051: 3, 108984178: 3, 110739544: 3, 110591893: 3, 200060911: 3, 200199785: 3, 200145579: 3, 107533223: 3, 200309634: 3, 105832216: 3, 109406130: 3, 109317339: 3, 200600982: 3, 112507024: 3, 200057419: 3, 110974889: 3, 107619140: 3, 110452119: 3, 108160061: 3, 200500108: 3, 200665016: 3, 106189019: 3, 200469253: 3, 200427395: 3, 200253280: 3, 200463147: 3, 200395157: 3, 108148725: 3, 106054402: 2, 105885115: 2, 106134707: 2, 106125724: 2, 106295169: 2, 106561728: 2, 106646308: 2, 106957265: 2, 107222279: 2, 108239435: 2, 107851075: 2, 109333124: 2, 106441684: 2, 108266600: 2, 108547929: 2, 107739229: 2, 108181716: 2, 108085357: 2, 107602549: 2, 107085584: 2, 108200547: 2, 106990659: 2, 108232287: 2, 111414778: 2, 112797688: 2, 110900723: 2, 112340080: 2, 112225815: 2, 109884427: 2, 111841723: 2, 110430741: 2, 107183979: 2, 112034333: 2, 200154262: 2, 200142768: 2, 108050314: 2, 108301940: 2, 200445602: 2, 107400819: 2, 200257412: 2, 107002071: 2, 109467833: 2, 111878504: 2, 200711420: 2, 107529159: 2}"

Originally done as a highball boulder problem up the corner and down climbed via Anchovy Caper, there are now two bolts in the corner.     Start on a good hold and a crimp and toss to a good jug on right dihedral wall, climb the 20 foot dihedral.  From here climb easier but fun ground up to the anchors for Anchovy Caper.     The history of this route is interesting, the bolts that you climb on were actually there for an easier alternative to Anchovy Caper, and the dihedral was done as a boulder problem, I believe by Mark Sprague, if you link the two together you get a quality route. It would be great for one lower bolt so its not quite so scary. It can by protected by lowering off from Anchovy Caper and pre-placing the quick-draw.

This is a fun route to warm up, end the day, or tick another 5.9 when you are in the area.","{106205646: 4, 108112975: 4, 108521517: 4, 107745631: 4, 109006073: 4, 110457315: 4, 106990659: 4, 111956051: 4, 106764476: 3, 106928886: 3, 105933166: 3, 105898385: 3, 105913936: 3, 106340439: 3, 106074233: 3, 106701857: 3, 106730034: 3, 106423391: 3, 106554048: 3, 106590583: 3, 108093743: 3, 106312507: 3, 107419765: 3, 108226496: 3, 107688321: 3, 107740836: 3, 108338368: 3, 107870857: 3, 107969579: 3, 108324210: 3, 107222279: 3, 107529337: 3, 107346586: 3, 108245630: 3, 108367150: 3, 110454327: 3, 107739229: 3, 108547663: 3, 109711410: 3, 107942262: 3, 110430741: 3, 110148121: 3, 111066391: 3, 108276722: 3, 110445741: 3, 109135839: 3, 111157860: 3, 109324282: 3, 110522591: 3, 109692317: 3, 110863928: 3, 111136253: 3, 110425509: 3, 111902978: 3, 108282189: 3, 106778019: 3, 108048090: 3, 109467833: 3, 111972941: 3, 111344408: 3, 112045434: 3, 112164950: 3, 106793247: 3, 110762698: 3, 112174305: 3, 112210382: 3, 111796230: 3, 200114064: 3, 111333328: 3, 111866796: 3, 111277314: 3, 200056643: 3, 111888281: 3, 200074903: 3, 110735872: 3, 200078875: 3, 107602549: 3, 110989228: 3, 200179150: 3, 106440310: 3, 200244052: 3, 111825461: 3, 110086015: 3, 107085584: 3, 200122335: 3, 200320209: 3, 111837902: 3, 200101052: 3, 110454201: 3, 107783414: 3, 111357648: 3, 111203516: 3, 200828495: 3, 7128541: 3, 200469947: 3, 109406130: 3, 200580231: 3, 200711420: 3, 106860568: 2, 107126711: 2, 106576182: 2, 105906559: 2, 106039986: 2, 105832216: 2, 106103271: 2, 107727693: 2, 106868421: 2, 106386213: 2, 106413328: 2, 105945019: 2, 106358364: 2, 106134707: 2, 106125724: 2, 106971875: 2, 106303677: 2, 106486112: 2, 106397425: 2, 108193208: 2, 107985789: 2, 108139891: 2, 107214214: 2, 107548455: 2, 108188495: 2, 108222002: 2, 108595560: 2, 106876126: 2, 108933008: 2, 106917454: 2, 109076559: 2, 109107529: 2, 107852661: 2, 108608330: 2, 109027015: 2, 108202763: 2, 109523045: 2, 108245758: 2, 106967283: 2, 108652563: 2, 109052547: 2, 108742211: 2, 110828030: 2, 109648338: 2, 107385412: 2, 110756813: 2, 106251687: 2, 110705741: 2, 110138155: 2, 110317485: 2, 108367353: 2, 111909917: 2, 109581799: 2, 108290010: 2, 107340026: 2, 111968804: 2, 109505100: 2, 107226876: 2, 107373999: 2, 110923255: 2, 109383300: 2, 111081279: 2, 110580188: 2, 112140841: 2, 109737113: 2, 109483250: 2, 111031033: 2, 111992110: 2, 108232287: 2, 112100929: 2, 112128898: 2, 111414778: 2, 113154763: 2, 111618132: 2, 113317393: 2, 112365589: 2, 112166651: 2, 113164188: 2, 200159460: 2, 109268194: 2, 110645674: 2, 200177688: 2, 200093946: 2, 109932626: 2, 200318804: 2, 111181604: 2, 200196315: 2, 110689679: 2, 200121608: 2, 111626403: 2, 108181716: 2, 110807699: 2, 110712867: 2, 200160054: 2, 111929003: 2, 200265615: 2, 200485073: 2, 110915247: 2, 112207022: 2, 200309634: 2, 200253280: 2, 200040702: 2, 111443138: 2, 105885115: 2, 107232890: 2, 113077522: 2, 200462073: 2, 107227104: 1, 106054402: 1, 107768862: 1, 106577584: 1, 107492957: 1, 106306579: 1, 106720416: 1, 107839581: 1, 107555169: 1, 105943577: 1, 107688970: 1, 106662131: 1, 106647777: 1, 110724330: 1, 109317339: 1, 107851075: 1, 200142768: 1, 111841723: 1, 106529846: 1, 200534596: 1, 110591893: 1, 200263895: 1, 200281875: 1, 200093802: 0}"

He asked me to try it today to see what I thought of the grade etc. It's still a bit scuzzy but has some nice moves on it. The route is much easier down low and harder and steeper up high. For this reason they put a mid way anchor on it.    Half Nelson 5.7- down hill and right of Men In White Suites (5.9) look for a corner with bolts. Climb very moderate moves to a head wall. 5.7/5.8 ish climbing up the headwall gets to a mantel and the first anchor. Lower off or continue on...    Full Nelson 5.11b- This upper section is very crimpy and pretty steep. 5.10 ish climbing leads to a hard boulder problem to rach the chains. Finding the holds is the hard part as of now. Once it is cleaner it will be easier to navigate.    Still a bit dirty and brittle.

I took note that a red or orange TCU would protect the upper crux section. I had no idea if it had been done before but i thought I'd give it a go. Today I climbed the variation and it was super cool with a few fun moves that keep you on your toes. I asked a guy at the crag that seemed like he had been around a while if the line had been done before and he informed me that he did the first ascent of it in the 80's. How weird is that, he just happened to be there. Anyway he gave me the name of the route and his name and told me that it was in the first Rumney guide book (which he wrote) as 5.11a, i told him that i agreed with the grade and that was that.     Sorry if that was a boring story here is the description you were looking for.    Climb through the crux of Scene of the Crime (5.10a) till you get to the roof where that route breaks right. clip a long draw on the fourth bolt and break through the roof on small holds and sinking your fingers in to an unlikely slot in the face (this is where you want to protect). get your feet up on to the face and make one or two delicate moves on tiny holds to latch the top. Mantel and clip.    If you don't care to lead it, it would be a nice top rope variation.","{111357648: 3, 106397425: 3, 106306579: 3, 106967283: 3, 105906559: 2, 106876126: 2, 108245758: 2, 108222002: 2, 107555169: 2, 106486112: 2, 105913936: 2, 107419765: 2, 107492957: 1, 105885115: 1}"

A fun route that I rarely see people on, so it might be a good one for a busy day.","{106075659: 4, 106744764: 4, 109387493: 4, 109545197: 4, 109324282: 4, 109581799: 4, 111744116: 4, 200152826: 4, 111916761: 4, 106764476: 3, 106928959: 3, 106434727: 3, 107753769: 3, 106358364: 3, 106971875: 3, 106590583: 3, 106860568: 3, 106306579: 3, 107347295: 3, 106397425: 3, 108125179: 3, 106028942: 3, 108273975: 3, 107492957: 3, 105913936: 3, 108244717: 3, 108157281: 3, 108622889: 3, 108436633: 3, 108207363: 3, 108202763: 3, 107107345: 3, 108362846: 3, 109268194: 3, 108048090: 3, 107852661: 3, 109006073: 3, 108547663: 3, 108323817: 3, 111066391: 3, 110522591: 3, 109317339: 3, 107412430: 3, 111972941: 3, 110762698: 3, 112169001: 3, 108324210: 3, 112210382: 3, 111825461: 3, 111928487: 3, 200101052: 3, 200122335: 3, 200067404: 3, 111626403: 3, 200227731: 3, 109269951: 3, 110337843: 3, 200534596: 3, 200564551: 3, 106191055: 3, 200263054: 3, 105832216: 3, 200855703: 3, 200297969: 3, 106576182: 2, 105906559: 2, 105943577: 2, 105839151: 2, 105879342: 2, 106039986: 2, 106577584: 2, 106124998: 2, 105990845: 2, 106134707: 2, 105885115: 2, 106205646: 2, 106145409: 2, 107126711: 2, 106486112: 2, 106646308: 2, 106957265: 2, 108093743: 2, 106591213: 2, 107664947: 2, 107790918: 2, 106239262: 2, 106868421: 2, 108222002: 2, 107555169: 2, 108326068: 2, 108551353: 2, 109157864: 2, 108608330: 2, 109337092: 2, 109073630: 2, 106586268: 2, 109444514: 2, 108652563: 2, 108245758: 2, 110320398: 2, 108200547: 2, 108265416: 2, 110531964: 2, 107739229: 2, 109052547: 2, 109076559: 2, 110454327: 2, 106662131: 2, 110592577: 2, 110828030: 2, 106210225: 2, 109135839: 2, 111136212: 2, 111181604: 2, 107000115: 2, 111197583: 2, 110841071: 2, 110138155: 2, 106417094: 2, 111091265: 2, 111789342: 2, 111844655: 2, 109136692: 2, 107851075: 2, 108290010: 2, 105859360: 2, 112065025: 2, 110856294: 2, 106793247: 2, 106990659: 2, 109383300: 2, 108276959: 2, 111031033: 2, 111992110: 2, 112312149: 2, 113113011: 2, 107373999: 2, 109692317: 2, 112030796: 2, 110315426: 2, 107059069: 2, 111921737: 2, 107346586: 2, 200151702: 2, 110262256: 2, 112086555: 2, 108693865: 2, 107602549: 2, 106876126: 2, 111841723: 2, 106440310: 2, 111087111: 2, 111700011: 2, 109932626: 2, 112207022: 2, 111666789: 2, 110454201: 2, 112938047: 2, 200375360: 2, 110739544: 2, 108181716: 2, 200063563: 2, 108473722: 2, 200249961: 2, 107400819: 2, 111203516: 2, 200314873: 2, 200430991: 2, 200253280: 2, 112401943: 2, 200469947: 2, 200840998: 2, 105898385: 2, 107085584: 2, 110591893: 2, 112859539: 2, 106054402: 1, 106561728: 1, 106897206: 1, 107651072: 1, 110671153: 1, 110924900: 1, 110631955: 1, 200129067: 1, 111650569: 1}"

Mesresha,111849930.0,Sport,105935079.0,5.13b,0.0,1.0,0.7,10.0,"Mesresha is a test of pure crimping prowess. It features generally small and sharp crimpers that trace a line up a bulging face, culminating with a brutal crank off a really small edge. Originally bolted in 2012 by Mike Robinson and Bradley White, this had to wait four years for a proper free ascent. Rumors of friable holds and unpleasant climbing kept many away from the route, and it gained a place in Rumney lore as an ill-conceived venture. Recently, however, the route was more thoroughly cleaned and to some surprise, this has turned out to be a pretty good route. It just goes to show that you shouldn't knock something until you try it.     To climb the route, amble up to the big ledge in the center of the crag and stare up at the bulging face. Climb up a bit and try to get the first three draws clipped. Go back to the ledge, rest, and warm up your fingers. Next, fire up the sustained crimp ladder to better holds above the 4th bolt and make a progressively easier romp to the anchors. In the crux, resist the urge to stem right to the less-steep rock over by Sesame Street.     Mike Robinson named this route after his son's middle name. According to Mike, ""in the Ethiopian culture it means 'something which helps one forget the pain of one's life and/or past.'""","{10610: 2, 105938601: 2, 106178530: 2, 106876126: 1, 111878504: 0, 107183979: 0, 106709875: 0, 105885115: 0, 106108710: 0, 106967283: 0}"

This sport version is a bit more direct, covering fun steep terrain at a 5.8+ grade.  Pitch 1: Start right of Armed and Dangerous (5.10b). Look for a high bolt above aboute 25 feet of very easy, ledgy climbing. Reach up, clip the bolt and follow a crack up to a corner with good holds where you can stem and then move right up a ramp, then finally make moves straight up the steep headwall on good holds (Look around for them) Top out the headwall and continue up a short easy, very featured slab to a second bulge. Lower from the anchor. ( a 60m rope just makes it!) A 70m rope recommended, though you can just get down with a 60 from this anchor if careful.   Pitch 2: Don't bother. Since the first anchor got raised, it is now very short, undistinguished and likely very dirty. The anchor may have been removed also.   ","{106726952: 4, 107100835: 4, 107661203: 4, 106535235: 4, 106816849: 4, 107768862: 4, 106876126: 4, 106306579: 4, 106486112: 4, 106701857: 4, 106814605: 4,

When he told me about the line he could read the skepticism on my face and said ""I know ::shrug:: go see for your self, it's good"". He's Right! A pretty short but very engaging line climbs the already shared start of Metamorphosis and Clusterphobia (Though an added bolt will make it less of a cluster) and breaks right in to the steep wall.     Follow the rail to the right after the relatively easy start. This rail gets less possessive as you move farther right. When the rail ends, a powerful move gets you to a jug and a clip. The crux involves an obvious underling crimp and the crimps above which will get you to a jug and the chain anchors.

A few of the key holds on the first part are a bit hidden, so if you feel like it's too hard for the grade you might be right.

Sesame Street,105959390.0,Sport,105935079.0,5.10b,0.0,1.0,3.1,252.0,"A really cool climb that didn't see much traffic until it was fully bolted, and it still doesn't. A long route with a few cruxes that test you in different ways that will keep you on your toes.    Start at the birch tree on the ledge about 25 feet up, to the right of Metamorphosis (5.8+). Climb the cracks (used to be protected with gear) to a stance at the base of a short steep corner where you can carefully clip a bolt and launch into a few hard moves that get you to a ledge rest. Continue up over another steep part with a cool mantel move. The final section surprised and scared me the first time I did it, 'cause I was in Rumney mode and all of the sudden I was looking at thin awkward moves on to a slab with few actual holds. Once I got in to Whitehorse mode, I was cool and did the few moves to the chains. you can make the final slab easier by stepping to the left then back right to clip your last bolt.   If the crowds are swarming around the other 10s in the area this route is typically still lonely, so give it some loving when you get the chance.","{106764476: 4, 106306579: 4, 107852661: 4, 108011499: 4, 108082111: 4, 108933008: 4, 107740836: 4, 108202763: 4, 107492957: 4, 109608840: 4, 107745631: 4, 110592577: 4, 110211008: 4, 106108710: 4, 106417094: 4, 109280499: 4, 111902978: 4, 110138155: 4, 106936938: 4, 105898385: 4, 111682044: 4, 108981462: 4, 110739544: 4, 111210662: 4, 112037097: 4, 107419765: 4, 112230384: 4, 108557813: 4, 112340080: 4, 111844655: 4, 112365589: 4, 111964000: 4, 112523297: 4, 107901211: 4, 107602549: 4, 200083850: 4, 200051256: 4, 200105825: 4, 200060331: 4, 112038160: 4, 108943993: 4, 111092753: 4, 200196315: 4, 111810451: 4, 110494556: 4, 111819549: 4, 200059743: 4, 110985244: 4, 112162593: 4, 200063563: 4, 111071864: 4, 200154262: 4, 200253783: 4, 200448949: 4, 200711420: 4, 200259729: 4, 200101052: 4, 110452119: 4, 106590583: 4, 200357400: 4, 200267777: 4, 200183282: 4, 200160054: 4, 107635859: 3, 105906559: 3, 105832216: 3, 107373999: 3, 105885115: 3, 106971875: 3, 106577584: 3, 106103271: 3, 107688321: 3, 107126711: 3, 106486112: 3, 10610: 3, 106408472: 3, 105899901: 3, 106134707: 3, 106720416: 3, 107324472: 3, 106957265: 3, 107969579: 3, 106928886: 3, 106922041: 3, 106360234: 3, 108222002: 3, 106868421: 3, 109171664: 3, 105913936: 3, 105960152: 3, 107617264: 3, 106423391: 3, 106879280: 3, 108245758: 3, 107403188: 3, 106967283: 3, 107851075: 3, 108521517: 3, 106538248: 3, 108742211: 3, 109076559: 3, 107346586: 3, 110456388: 3, 109491966: 3, 109984716: 3, 110262256: 3, 110970484: 3, 109692317: 3, 105943577: 3, 108245344: 3, 110317485: 3, 108323817: 3, 109645277: 3, 110856294: 3, 105938601: 3, 106889145: 3, 111066391: 3, 108290010: 3, 111807308: 3, 108324210: 3, 111824829: 3, 111081279: 3, 111181604: 3, 108200547: 3, 110294685: 3, 111468613: 3, 109483250: 3, 112322643: 3, 109581799: 3, 106895019: 3, 109260781: 3, 110900723: 3, 200101883: 3, 109255473: 3, 111169936: 3, 112411512: 3, 111649446: 3, 110172496: 3, 112042073: 3, 200078875: 3, 109884427: 3, 111921737: 3, 108181716: 3, 109017895: 3, 111278312: 3, 200151025: 3, 108245630: 3, 111657384: 3, 200074903: 3, 107085584: 3, 107183979: 3, 109585594: 3, 112286747: 3, 111077991: 3, 200312793: 3, 200265615: 3, 200336149: 3, 110751062: 3, 200296165: 3, 110625617: 3, 106484669: 3, 112352056: 3, 111982873: 3, 200263422: 3, 112507024: 3, 110454201: 3, 111626403: 3, 112166651: 3, 110181635: 3, 200051409: 3, 200294199: 3, 106529776: 3, 106146571: 3, 112134112: 3, 110942549: 3, 111357648: 3, 110350599: 3, 200194815: 3, 111779719: 3, 110712867: 3, 110262051: 3, 111882861: 3, 200289394: 3, 111426811: 3, 111783002: 3, 200450420: 3, 107072217: 3, 112207022: 3, 106191055: 3, 200199785: 3, 200145579: 3, 200130009: 3, 107108243: 3, 200056643: 3, 200253280: 3, 200395157: 3, 110591893: 3, 200416944: 3, 111741206: 3, 200057419: 3, 110974889: 3, 200469253: 3, 107529159: 3, 200253285: 3, 112211778: 3, 108148725: 3, 109393254: 3, 107169450: 3, 106054402: 2, 105963968: 2, 106125724: 2, 106702886: 2, 105945019: 2, 105890157: 2, 107222279: 2, 108087249: 2, 105959323: 2, 105851541: 2, 107555169: 2, 106876126: 2, 108145511: 2, 107739229: 2, 109371843: 2, 106647777: 2, 106397425: 2, 110425509: 2, 109328345: 2, 109230273: 2, 111968804: 2, 108652563: 2, 110224429: 2, 110631955: 2, 111142184: 2, 112128898: 2, 107327535: 2, 111414778: 2, 111841723: 2, 110878282: 2, 109620395: 2, 110923255: 2, 107469778: 2, 200319558: 2, 200319717: 2, 112034333: 2, 112797688: 2, 106646308: 2, 108050314: 2, 200445602: 2, 200220515: 2, 106858324: 2, 200833892: 2, 200079239: 1}"
Slack,106018063.0,Trad,105935079.0,5.5,0.0,1.0,1.8,8.0,"So when i started leading trad climbs i climbed every moderate trad route i could find so i could practice placing gear and get used to trusting it. Not all the routes rate high on the quality scale but i found them to be helpful. This one is actually very cool but i didn't rate it highly due to the fact that it traverses under a few popular routes and people would be likely to give you some mumbles and grumbles (if not worse) if you did it on a busy day. However if you are a practicing trad leader and find yourself all alone at this crag you might enjoy a run on this one.    Many bolts have been added since i climbed it so trad gear might not be needed at all anymore on the first pitch but i think a few hand sized cams could be helpful on the traverse crack.    Pitch 1: Climb up the start of metamorphosis which is retrobolted. Where that route goes right you want to follow a hand crack left under clusterphobia (bolts added for this route might help you a bit) follow the crack left past Armed and Dangerous to a nice ledge where you can belay. There are bolt anchors there now. Rap off or do the second pitch.    Pitch 2: Unless someone has cleaned it up, this pitch was adventurous at best. You head up and right on fun climbing to an old rap anchor which was in rough shape when i did it but that was years ago. I decided to continue up the slab above on a scary lichen adventure with little gear. This slab was not in the guide book description so i dont know the exact grade. I'd say scary 5.7.    Again it has been a while since I've been up there so i dont know if it has been cleaned or bolted or what. If anyone knows the current state of this section of cliff please comment and i will update this info.","{106253664: 3, 105885115: 2, 108310475: 2, 106178530: 2, 108222002: 2, 105906559: 1, 106588964: 1, 108245758: 1}"

Though originally the route involved a 4th class traverse from the left side of the Iron Man Ledge to a big pine tree, you are now better off coming up the first pitch of the Big Easy or Toxic Gumbo. From the top of the corner the route followed a huge flake (now part of the trail below!) into what is now the upper slab of Bourbon Street and the White Buttress above. The absence of the flake cut the route in half, but if you have a little gear the corner is a nice short second pitch.

Start from the ledge near the big tree and work the rope out so it runs straight. I just throw the rope around the tree so the belayer can stand under the start of the route.   Anyway, climb the steep corner above, working the feet and making a tough move out left to a good stance.

You will be looking down in to the Baker River Valley and the river it self bending its way through. The best place to view this area we love so much.    Place a nice solid piece and step up in to it. A finger size cam placed just after I started kept me happy as I made sense of the strange crack holds, slippery quartz feet and face holds hidden by lichen. After a 15 foot crux section you can stand on your feet before clipping a pin and pulling one more tricky section. This upper bulge is a little less difficult but more fun than the crux. Top out on a nice jug and decide where you'd like to anchor. There isn't a perfect spot to do so but a few trees to choose from.    With a good cleaning this would be a great climb. Not sure if it would see enough use to keep it clean unless it was bolted.

I found it to be reachy (and I'm 6' 2"") and the bolt placement seemed a little weird. The first 2 bolts are good. The 3rd bolt felt like it could get you in to ground fall zone. The 3rd and 4th were off to the left farther than I thought they should be. The anchors were really hard to reach from what I saw as the finishing hold. That being said, the climbing it self was engaging mentally and physically and is very worth while if you can look past the quirks listed above.     Start up a technical face on pretty good holds that are sometimes far apart. After about 4 bolts the wall kicks back big time and you tackle a juggy roof to the anchors.

After the crux its just a walk up the super moderate slab to the chains.     Start as for Bullwinkle Craters (5.11b) for a few steep jug moves with one really cool hold. Pull the tricky move on to the slab then 5.3ish climbing brings you to the left end of the upper deck of New Wave Wall. As Mark commented, you can run this route in to Air and Pleasant Danger (5.8) for a longer climb. Use a 70m rope if you do this and plan to come all the way back to the ground.","{108416778: 4, 109324282: 4, 106764476: 3, 108197797: 3, 107921774: 3, 109101477: 3, 106701857: 3, 109506662: 3, 107768989: 3, 108157281: 3, 110582478: 3, 110813639: 3, 109545197: 3, 107876007: 3, 112322643: 3, 200129067: 3, 200220970: 3, 200074903: 3, 200445602: 3, 200438087: 3, 200474321: 3, 107663772: 2, 106876126: 2, 105906559: 2, 105933166: 2, 106103271: 2, 107229044: 2, 106096336: 2, 106134707: 2, 106125724: 2, 106417094: 2, 106358364: 2, 105890157: 2, 106706501: 2, 106853290: 2, 106486112: 2, 108193208: 2, 106922041: 2, 106928886: 2, 108181716: 2, 108145511: 2, 107630444: 2, 108244717: 2, 106868421: 2, 106360234: 2, 107852661: 2, 106762873: 2, 106538248: 2, 106917454: 2, 108362846: 2, 107403188: 2, 108266600: 2, 107529337: 2, 110547878: 2, 110365118: 2, 110966682: 2, 107739229: 2, 111039775: 2, 110317485: 2, 108110667: 2, 109392078: 2, 109136692: 2, 111682044: 2, 108290010: 2, 111902978: 2, 110841071: 2, 109645277: 2, 108200547: 2, 112037097: 2, 111181604: 2, 111917126: 2, 105859360: 2, 109683196: 2, 200078875: 2, 112079214: 2, 109585594: 2, 111163750: 2, 106590583: 2, 200105749: 2, 110762698: 2, 111777299: 2, 107346586: 2, 108552179: 2, 111825461: 2, 107318184: 2, 110430741: 2, 110739544: 2, 106967283: 2, 112166651: 2, 111779719: 2, 200296165: 2, 110454201: 2, 111118747: 2, 200437181: 2, 200101052: 2, 110985244: 2, 200381053: 2, 200160054: 2, 200534596: 2, 200122418: 2, 110712867: 2, 200485328: 2, 200056643: 2, 112134112: 2, 112207022: 2, 110989228: 2, 200145579: 2, 200154262: 2, 112038160: 2, 111277314: 2, 200602398: 2, 200408941: 2, 105832216: 2, 200430991: 2, 200855703: 2, 110591893: 2, 107408975: 1, 106860568: 1, 107607766: 1, 105898385: 1, 105943577: 1, 106971875: 1, 106054402: 1, 106074233: 1, 106561728: 1, 105885115: 1, 106710887: 1, 106075659: 1, 106916096: 1, 106306579: 1, 107126711: 1, 107969579: 1, 106397425: 1, 108711756: 1, 108933008: 1, 108222002: 1, 107639861: 1, 108245758: 1, 107085584: 1, 106108710: 1, 109692317: 1, 107477790: 1, 107851075: 1, 108052600: 1, 108832516: 1, 107602549: 1, 111921737: 1, 108871640: 1, 110262256: 1, 109467833: 1, 110592577: 1, 111841723: 1, 200374248: 1, 200057419: 1, 111071864: 1, 200241423: 1, 108981414: 1, 112935042: 1, 200171228: 1}"

Originally an aid climb, It was later free climbed on gear and given the grade of 5.11d. It has been retro bolted and the grade has been upped to 5.12a in the latest guide book. If I were voting it might be the hardest 5.12a on the hill with only a couple of contenders. Moral of the story, old school dudes with trad racks are always tougher than the rest of us.    The climb is steep with some real trickery and some straight up hard pulling forearm pumping fun. Though it follows a crack system it is not a crack climb. There are two cruxes for me, One is mostly awkward the other is a difficult hold up toward the top of the climb.     Notes:   A little sharp in places.   Not the cleanest route.   Often wet.

Top out and do a few easy moves to the anchor.","{106716166: 4, 107628457: 4, 107246852: 4, 105906559: 4, 107475857: 4, 105990845: 4, 105811636: 4, 105938601: 4, 106134707: 4, 105898385: 4, 107655644: 4, 106253664: 4, 106103271: 4, 106378848: 4, 12525: 4, 106230078: 4, 106486112: 4, 106075659: 4, 106271741: 4, 106702886: 4, 105945019: 4, 107138006: 4, 106971875: 4, 105941791: 4, 106239262: 4, 107969579: 4, 107100666: 4, 108097063: 4, 106957265: 4, 107377680: 4, 108254835: 4, 106360234: 4, 107742566: 4, 107852661: 4, 108200086: 4, 107698881: 4, 106538248: 4, 109076559: 4, 108188613: 4, 107619140: 4, 109317339: 4, 106915218: 4, 108222002: 4, 107620610: 4, 108245758: 4, 109638995: 4, 108216908: 4, 106108710: 4, 107745631: 4, 108726865: 4, 109648338: 4, 110471998: 4, 109219225: 4, 106536458: 4, 108651062: 4, 110365118: 4, 111039775: 4, 107801617: 4, 108148725: 4, 107457259: 4, 107723439: 4, 108032974: 4, 109995562: 4, 111181604: 4, 108923341: 4, 109581799: 4, 106578430: 4, 106922041: 4, 108290010: 4, 108832516: 4, 108362846: 4, 111783002: 4, 111909917: 4, 110259196: 4, 111546336: 4, 111468613: 4, 109483250: 4, 110494556: 4, 106917454: 4, 112042073: 4, 111682044: 4, 110096299: 4, 109255473: 4, 106736847: 4, 112810423: 4, 200054289: 4, 107346586: 4, 200063563: 4, 107327535: 4, 200074903: 4, 108531812: 4, 109505100: 4, 112135278: 4, 110619029: 4, 108871640: 4, 107412430: 4, 106890179: 4, 111142184: 4, 106125724: 4, 110933558: 4, 200041839: 4, 111964000: 4, 111344408: 4, 200142241: 4, 111692889: 4, 11509: 4, 110165451: 4, 112527602: 4, 200310208: 4, 200105825: 4, 200336149: 4, 200253783: 4, 110756813: 4, 106829444: 4, 200374248: 4, 105885115: 4, 200101052: 4, 107711888: 4, 106967283: 4, 107621295: 4, 111626403: 4, 200381053: 4, 200107036: 4, 7073220: 4, 200278987: 4, 111674806: 4, 110262051: 4, 105970716: 4, 108984178: 4, 110739544: 4, 200182951: 4, 110915247: 4, 112207022: 4, 200355092: 4, 200145579: 4, 200199785: 4, 106191055: 4, 107046125: 4, 200407762: 4, 200257412: 4, 200392328: 4, 200253647: 4, 200469253: 4, 200337611: 4, 107529159: 4, 106189019: 4, 200391298: 4, 200194815: 4, 200840998: 4, 110117691: 4, 106441684: 3, 105890157: 3, 106970957: 3, 106985791: 3, 107658815: 3, 105832216: 3, 10610: 3, 105879342: 3, 105927660: 3, 105943577: 3, 105886022: 3, 106876126: 3, 105839151: 3, 106804724: 3, 105963968: 3, 106555971: 3, 106011053: 3, 106117267: 3, 107207686: 3, 106038842: 3, 106347294: 3, 106411080: 3, 106172714: 3, 105913936: 3, 106151063: 3, 106615429: 3, 106710887: 3, 106720416: 3, 106469275: 3, 106561728: 3, 105899248: 3, 106646308: 3, 108193208: 3, 108197797: 3, 106098789: 3, 107257835: 3, 106397425: 3, 107617264: 3, 106054402: 3, 108139891: 3, 106588555: 3, 107630444: 3, 108358223: 3, 107671020: 3, 105851541: 3, 108922775: 3, 107529337: 3, 106043058: 3, 107419765: 3, 109101477: 3, 107729640: 3, 108894743: 3, 109280290: 3, 106701857: 3, 108512985: 3, 106895019: 3, 106868421: 3, 108195048: 3, 108652563: 3, 107739229: 3, 107085584: 3, 108301940: 3, 107287218: 3, 108181716: 3, 108257055: 3, 107009084: 3, 108547663: 3, 106484669: 3, 108145511: 3, 106251687: 3, 108029322: 3, 106146571: 3, 109645277: 3, 111066391: 3, 107169450: 3, 107172119: 3, 109340692: 3, 108802550: 3, 108266600: 3, 110262256: 3, 109467833: 3, 108324210: 3, 105859360: 3, 109692317: 3, 110935614: 3, 111875474: 3, 111488411: 3, 106569219: 3, 112174414: 3, 107629960: 3, 106990659: 3, 110668667: 3, 111710111: 3, 112322643: 3, 107548227: 3, 108232287: 3, 108747074: 3, 112166087: 3, 109383300: 3, 110166994: 3, 200062708: 3, 200072916: 3, 107764394: 3, 112230384: 3, 106210225: 3, 112439618: 3, 111278312: 3, 110293668: 3, 110232870: 3, 107059069: 3, 105875389: 3, 109585594: 3, 200047954: 3, 108364795: 3, 112146574: 3, 111882861: 3, 112079214: 3, 112225815: 3, 107260705: 3, 110762698: 3, 107841551: 3, 112797688: 3, 200067404: 3, 110675365: 3, 200234516: 3, 111077991: 3, 111443138: 3, 200159460: 3, 108692265: 3, 111047210: 3, 200146484: 3, 109040038: 3, 110712867: 3, 107931921: 3, 112507024: 3, 112938047: 3, 112166651: 3, 110524225: 3, 107921774: 3, 112375922: 3, 112134112: 3, 200305867: 3, 200245769: 3, 107072217: 3, 200057419: 3, 110152422: 3, 111426811: 3, 107002071: 3, 200408941: 3, 200452607: 3, 112028027: 3, 111624586: 3, 111878504: 3, 200825839: 3, 112066146: 3, 110454932: 3, 110689679: 3, 105961696: 2, 106403737: 2, 106957118: 2, 106139012: 2, 106202599: 2, 106271309: 2, 106807311: 2, 106897206: 2, 106449525: 2, 107851075: 2, 109472534: 2, 107492957: 2, 106647777: 2, 111781359: 2, 110813639: 2, 111844655: 2, 111824829: 2, 111841723: 2, 110294685: 2, 111414778: 2, 112091056: 2, 108121411: 2, 109328345: 2, 109884427: 2, 200155809: 2, 200244052: 2, 200296165: 2, 200125380: 2, 111810451: 2, 108050314: 2, 200372430: 2, 200267314: 2, 111204599: 2, 200120733: 2, 110452119: 2, 109575088: 1, 200665016: 1}"

Start by stick clipping and pulling through a steep bouldery intro. Clip the piton and figure out the tricky and straight up difficult crux move.

Although a bit on the short side, the line is lovely, following a striking orange and mica streak through dark rock.  Start left of the first bolt by stepping off large boulders and move right to gain a rest on the slab.  Then move up and left on small crimps and tackle the kneebar crux, a stab out left from an oppressive sloper. Kundalini is actually a type of yoga involving tense, muscular poses, and that's exactly what the route requires.  After the crux, the moves get progressively easier, though still interesting, through the small roof to the chains.","{111902978: 4, 112425011: 4, 110446085: 4, 107183979: 4, 107759564: 4, 107477790: 4, 107602549: 4, 110813639: 4, 110365118: 4, 106876126: 4, 200391175: 4, 111181604: 4, 106967283: 3, 111204599: 3, 200257412: 3, 109328345: 3, 106922041: 3, 106913999: 3, 108245758: 3, 108364795: 3, 109371843: 3, 108181716: 3, 112512805: 3, 111443138: 3, 111741206: 3, 12345: 3, 107166848: 3, 105981136: 3, 106024037: 3, 106440358: 3, 12525: 3, 106646308: 3, 105938601: 3, 105906559: 3, 106425299: 3, 106397425: 3, 106538248: 3, 106108710: 3, 110264932: 3, 106011053: 2, 106125724: 2, 108032974: 2, 105879342: 2, 10610: 2, 109467833: 2}"

Use the prominent flake to make progress up the massive overhang.  Would be a great inverted layback if there were feet with which to oppose.  Be more creative, unless you're a campusing mutant.

Head up the right wall on super crimpy holds then up and left in to the corner proper and use pods and pockets to get to the wicked nice rest ledge. Rest up cause it gets harder.

The route involves power and some very balancy and technical moves.    Stick clip the first bolt and bust in to the steep part, big moves on really good holds. Move through this quickly so not to pump yourself out. Some interesting moves lead to a good, sharp, horn hold leading up to a few pinches a possible, knee-bar rest and a final, thin section that I've seen done many ways.

That section is the power crux. sit at the rest and get recharged for the technical crux while looking up and wondering how you will pull it off. Clip a pin from the ledge with a long sling climb up and place a small cam in the crack in the roof (finger-size). Head up and right under the roof awkwardly to clip another bolt and a few more moves on small crimps and a pocket to the chains.    A little slab technique is helpful on the upper crux. I used a palm on the roof and a few small holds in the corner as well. Very interesting and perplexing route.

The moves are fun, easy to work, and the falls are clean.","{106716166: 4, 105832216: 4, 106494505: 4, 105906559: 4, 106876126: 4, 105937220: 4, 107759564: 4, 106569219: 4, 107665229: 4, 105938601: 4, 105898385: 4, 105895298: 4, 106440358: 4, 106378848: 4, 105890286: 4, 106486112: 4, 106720416: 4, 106901918: 4, 106702886: 4, 106842434: 4, 106985791: 4, 106807311: 4, 106646308: 4, 107066178: 4, 106928886: 4, 107102487: 4, 107878732: 4, 107969579: 4, 106922041: 4, 107574666: 4, 106890022: 4, 106397425: 4, 108181716: 4, 106449525: 4, 107178254: 4, 106423391: 4, 106043058: 4, 106915218: 4, 108512985: 4, 106071538: 4, 109107529: 4, 108245758: 4, 108266600: 4, 109635553: 4, 109090508: 4, 109316126: 4, 107639861: 4, 108075297: 4, 109648338: 4, 108843325: 4, 109272971: 4, 108651062: 4, 110365118: 4, 109317339: 4, 107457259: 4, 107941619: 4, 106936938: 4, 111902978: 4, 108290010: 4, 105791468: 4, 107739229: 4, 109970676: 4, 110919494: 4, 106741264: 4, 112174414: 4, 110675365: 4, 110668667: 4, 112322643: 4, 111741206: 4, 106895019: 4, 109230273: 4, 109638995: 4, 113126252: 4, 111181604: 4, 109031629: 4, 200066680: 4, 110293668: 4, 109255473: 4, 105798365: 4, 110621264: 4, 110470284: 4, 110877362: 4, 111961457: 4, 112225055: 4, 111777299: 4, 111468613: 4, 111278312: 4, 111460857: 4, 106967283: 4, 107841551: 4, 200084964: 4, 200056643: 4, 112107114: 4, 108027731: 4, 200067404: 4, 107100666: 4, 107169450: 4, 112527602: 4, 109230058: 4, 112077176: 4, 112042073: 4, 107852661: 4, 110756813: 4, 110172496: 4, 108625148: 4, 111502816: 4, 107533665: 4, 200074903: 4, 200107036: 4, 200335317: 4, 110262051: 4, 200278987: 4, 200182951: 4, 112207022: 4, 200407762: 4, 200602398: 4, 107355157: 4, 200257412: 4, 110970484: 4, 200828456: 4, 200316373: 4, 200833892: 4, 200253783: 4, 107841428: 4, 200040702: 4, 111204599: 4, 111546553: 4, 111160230: 4, 112166649: 4, 200325236: 4, 105890157: 3, 10610: 3, 105879342: 3, 105885115: 3, 106030548: 3, 107655644: 3, 105943577: 3, 106403737: 3, 107418055: 3, 106011053: 3, 12525: 3, 105886022: 3, 106271741: 3, 106347294: 3, 106202599: 3, 106125724: 3, 106633117: 3, 106187478: 3, 106710887: 3, 106487539: 3, 106273389: 3, 106561728: 3, 106134707: 3, 106610440: 3, 105945019: 3, 105963968: 3, 106455989: 3, 105941791: 3, 107217576: 3, 106736847: 3, 106775653: 3, 108087249: 3, 108145511: 3, 107628457: 3, 109101477: 3, 109172640: 3, 109252997: 3, 109392078: 3, 108188613: 3, 109371843: 3, 108362846: 3, 106538248: 3, 109219225: 3, 108085357: 3, 106536458: 3, 108709053: 3, 107226876: 3, 107801617: 3, 107002071: 3, 106108710: 3, 107085584: 3, 106146571: 3, 106647777: 3, 106889145: 3, 110813639: 3, 110259196: 3, 108638725: 3, 107009084: 3, 109383300: 3, 107174265: 3, 109692317: 3, 110294685: 3, 108032974: 3, 111844655: 3, 108232287: 3, 112128898: 3, 107764394: 3, 112230384: 3, 111841723: 3, 111649446: 3, 107260705: 3, 111781359: 3, 200084000: 3, 200175107: 3, 108047997: 3, 108364795: 3, 107453284: 3, 200266142: 3, 109585594: 3, 200296165: 3, 11509: 3, 112810423: 3, 111344408: 3, 200336149: 3, 109040038: 3, 200060331: 3, 107481504: 3, 108943993: 3, 200374248: 3, 107711888: 3, 110689679: 3, 110739544: 3, 200229308: 3, 108301940: 3, 200253647: 3, 111951400: 3, 200359801: 3, 200063563: 3, 110524225: 3, 200116803: 3, 200595483: 3, 200488767: 3, 200319558: 3, 112028027: 3, 110122418: 3, 200057419: 3, 200711420: 3, 111878504: 3, 200743333: 3, 106189019: 3, 109467833: 3, 111443138: 3, 105927660: 2, 107166848: 2, 105981136: 2, 106054402: 2, 109575088: 2, 106038528: 2, 110166994: 2, 110592577: 2, 108367150: 2, 109328345: 2, 107059069: 2, 109884427: 2, 107183979: 2, 200422946: 2, 200665016: 2}"
Social Promotion,111188145.0,Sport,105876699.0,5.12d,75.0,1.0,2.5,2.0,"  Social Promotion is likely the hardest route at Bonsai, and has a very separate style from the typical Rumney route. After you shake off the pump from A Slice of Life, give this one a try!  From a large jug at the second to last bolt of A Slice of Life move the right via bouldery moves on crimps to a massive horn jug and a fixed draw in the middle of a very steep face.

Everything I saw looked like it needed a chainsaw""    That almost sums it up. Though I did find it, climb it, and even convinced a friend to follow it purely for laughs. We didn't bring a chainsaw but could have used it. The description can't get across the silliness of climbing this line which is fun in it's own way. Most won't get the point but for those who do, here is a description.    I started by climbing a tree, slinging a branch for pro, before stepping on to a slab with 3 inch thick moss and struggling not to slip until i could scramble to a dead tree. Climbed over the dead tree and on to a ledge. The corner is obscured by a good size conifer tree. I stepped around the tree placed a small cam and started up the corner which would indeed feel 5.5 if it was clean and dry, it was not. From a stance i fiddled in funky gear and made a slippery step up and left to a small stance. I slung a small tree growing from the top of the corner then used it to gain the bushy ledge above. Grabbing fist fulls of brush i dragged my self on to the ledge laughing (which is why I do this sort of thing, it's a good laugh). From there, there was a surprisingly trick move through small bushes in to a fingerlock in the only piece of exposed rock and another fist full of plants to a tree belay :)    it would be possible to continue up the slab above for 30ft to the top but we just walked off to the right.","{105906559: 0, 108245758: 0}"

When the RCA secured the land I went there right away to get after this thing and found Ward had put an anchor above the climb. I respectfully backed down and put up some other stuff but kept my eye on it until Ward graciously gave me the okay to get after it.  Figuring out the movement was so exciting as every section felt both challenging and playful. Kneebars, partial inversion, crazy core tension and a very interesting exit on to a slab, there is so much substance in this little climb. I had the feeling it would be spectacular and I was not let down. I would give it 4 stars if it was a little longer.  Start on a giant jug, use some trickery to gain a crimp and a decent hold. Kneebar out right (you will likely want a pad). Use the knee bar to get to the roof and in to a pocket, move right under the roof with difficulty and considerable core tension. At the lip you get very good holds and it seems like it souldn't be so hard but gravity is high as you attempt to surmount the slab above and scamper to the anchor.  youtube.com/watch?v=6HM85xZ…","{108235470: 4, 200222930: 4, 112166649: 4, 112568619: 4, 108245758: 4, 105906559: 3}"

It was a little moist when I did it so perhaps next time it will go a little better. Apparently it is always wet in the spring but I'm thinking it will be really sweet in the fall.    Climb the steep wall with some trickery to gain nice fingerlocks in a short crack. As the wall steepens above the holds get better and the trick is just getting to them.

Stick clip the first bolt and step across the gap to get established on the climb. Make very awkward progress up the steep ramp heading up and right. The climbing involves balance and utilizing slopers and awkward holds to the second bolt. It gets a little easier from here.

For some reason once I had thought of it I had to do it. I couldn't get it out of my head. After all I don't climb to be serious and cool, I climb cause it's fun. This route is quite fun.     Basically it is a 4 route link up from the lowest part of the cliff to the summit climbing mostly previously climbed rock but adding about 20 feet of new stuff. Climb the super fun opening moves of Storm Troopers, then enjoy some new rock heading left to gain the lay down rest on The Caged. After your nap get in to the crux sequence by pulling a really fun interesting couple of moves in to the top of Jedi Mind Tricks. I continued over to the top of Obi-wan and fought crazy rope drag to the top. You don't have to if you don't want to that was just my vision for a long route on a short cliff. If you prefer you can just clip the Jedi chains.

For a relatively short climb, you will get a great variety of movements and techniques out of it....   A steep, strong start leads to a great foot hold out right where you rest a minute and figure out this cruxy section (jamming and fingerlocking will help) as you get over the bulge, but most people just keep pulling till the angle eases up a bit....    A short slab leads to a crack finish up awesome super grippy rock....    There is often a line for this route...though it's worth the wait, you are at Rumney, there are tons of killer 5.9s out there... Climb a few and come back on the way out when the line is gone and the sunset light makes the view breathtaking....","{105906559: 4, 105832216: 4, 10610: 4, 107430471: 4, 105879342: 4, 105938601: 4,

Figure some gear and climb the corner to a really fun move exiting the corner. I recommend continuing up Electric Socks, it's fun and has a better anchor.    Do be aware that this climb could be as dangerous for the belayer as it is for the leader. Watch for loose blocks!","{108245758: 3, 109581799: 3, 105906559: 2, 105885115: 0}"

The opening sequence is deceptive but if you work it all out it goes really well. After picking your way through the steeper beginning section you move on to a lower angle and quite enjoyable upper wall. Make your way up to a comfortable ledge near the top of the cliff and clip that anchor.  This route is much better than I had expected. Thanks mark!

Ravens have a long memory of individuals who bother them and will sometimes try to bomb you with rocks.","{108222002: 4, 106358784: 4, 108521517: 4, 106486112: 4, 106590583: 4, 108323817: 4, 110762698: 4, 200561363: 4, 110259196: 4, 110216439: 4, 112846385: 4, 200152826: 4, 106075659: 4, 107419765: 4, 105906559: 4, 107694526: 4, 10186: 4, 110575489: 3, 110262256: 3, 111655010: 3, 112823201: 3, 110970484: 3, 109581799: 3, 107901211: 3, 200074903: 3, 109467833: 3, 111344408: 3, 105859360: 3, 111825461: 3, 110317485: 3, 111142184: 3, 112365589: 3, 110968380: 3, 108245758: 3, 108181716: 3, 200844267: 3, 105898385: 3, 106177913: 3, 105885115: 3, 107126711: 3, 106870859: 3, 106726952: 3, 106349052: 3, 106529776: 3, 106340439: 3, 109269951: 3, 105832216: 3, 109027015: 3, 110712867: 3, 109317339: 3, 107852661: 3, 106834913: 3, 108364795: 2, 111849990: 2, 107346586: 2, 106426493: 2, 110452119: 2, 200357400: 2, 110591893: 2, 112134112: 2, 105961696: 2, 106306579: 2, 106971875: 2, 108145511: 2, 108912469: 2, 110906588: 2, 111806499: 2, 107739229: 2, 106588964: 2, 200078875: 2, 106380993: 2, 106767622: 2, 200067100: 2, 111031033: 2, 111719938: 2, 106134707: 1, 106720416: 1, 200010403: 1, 106347294: 1, 112086555: 1, 106897206: 1, 108076266: 1, 111546553: 1, 111841723: 1, 112042073: 0, 200053341: 0}"

It is a very recognizable route, dominant and steep, bulging over the top of a 55 or so foot slab. The slab section is 5.7, enjoyable, following a neat-looking dike that tapers the further up you get.  Pull up onto the steep after clipping the anchors for the .7 with an extended sling and pull on the biggest jugs that could ever exist for about four or so moves. The mid-section is where it starts to get harder, traverse left a couple of moves (while realizing that there's a lot of exposure up here). Pulling up out of the steepest part of the route is grunty, and finish up on a couple of more technical moves. It is a beautiful route.","{106716166: 4, 106702886: 4, 106876126: 4, 107475857: 4, 107183979: 4, 105981136: 4, 105885115: 4, 106075659: 4, 106441684: 4, 106139012: 4, 106361272: 4, 106440358: 4, 106347294: 4, 105970326: 4, 106486112: 4, 105906559: 4, 105895298: 4, 106720416: 4, 106842434: 4, 107099715: 4, 105963968: 4, 106807311: 4, 106125724: 4, 106646308: 4, 106360234: 4, 106239262: 4, 106449525: 4, 109101477: 4, 109317339: 4, 105926739: 4, 108245758: 4, 108266600: 4, 109451035: 4, 108270237: 4, 107621814: 4, 108075297: 4, 106538248: 4, 106423391: 4, 107574666: 4, 108790842: 4, 110970484: 4, 108087249: 4, 109638995: 4, 111824829: 4, 110259196: 4, 106936938: 4, 106108710: 4, 106425299: 4, 110294685: 4, 112086555: 4, 111488411: 4, 112174414: 4, 110856294: 4, 110668667: 4, 109383300: 4, 108121411: 4, 108367150: 4, 109472534: 4, 107801617: 4, 200136973: 4, 110762698: 4, 110739544: 4, 200074903: 4, 110942549: 4, 108032974: 4, 107561580: 4, 112549869: 4, 106922041: 4, 107102487: 4, 108181716: 4, 200057419: 4, 110592577: 4, 111935346: 4, 109018792: 4, 111460857: 4, 112142591: 4, 200374248: 4, 106967283: 4, 111810451: 4, 110172496: 4, 200129067: 4, 106985791: 4, 110689679: 4, 111278312: 4, 107708116: 4, 109648338: 4, 111741206: 4, 200267314: 4, 111181604: 4, 200488767: 4, 110262051: 4, 200316373: 4, 200150489: 4, 112276558: 4, 106913999: 4, 112207022: 4, 200154262: 4, 200246689: 4, 105832216: 4, 200257412: 4, 200711420: 4, 200209467: 4, 111129685: 4, 107852661: 4, 111204599: 4, 110746025: 4, 200296165: 4, 108739681: 4, 111160230: 4, 106189019: 4, 110591893: 4, 200295870: 4, 109467833: 4, 111443138: 4, 200278987: 4, 106344939: 3, 107969579: 3, 107260705: 3, 108085357: 3, 107176257: 3, 109328345: 3, 109884427: 3, 105964192: 3, 111841723: 3, 111692889: 3, 106485796: 3, 200665016: 3, 107655644: 2, 106403737: 2}"

Hot Head,106013514.0,Sport,105931460.0,5.10c,0.0,1.0,2.0,49.0,"Not my favorite route here. The slab climbing is good, the top out is good, but oh the crux sucks. It's not particularly hard, just very crunched up and awkward if you don't think your moves out, at least for me and everyone else that I've seen, maybe you'll have a more enjoyable experience.  Climb up the bolt line to the left of Black Slabbath and to the right of the huge Dyke leading up to Giant Man. At the top of the slab you can clip the anchors and then lower off having ticked a great 5.9, or put an extended draw on the anchor and pull over the lip into the crunched up cave. Awkwardly make your way to the right. Make good use of extended draws or slings here otherwise the rope drag gets pretty heavy beyond this point. After working out to a comfortable rest on the right, climb the cool ramp on the right to the crack in the face on the left. Hopefully you got the route clean so you won't have to do the crux again. I recommend lowering off to the first anchor and re-routing the rope if you plan to clean your gear on rappel or as you are lowered as the wear on the rope can be heavy and cleaning can be tough from the top anchors.   Also, be aware of other climber in the area, particularly on Black Slabbath as you will be climbing above them and potentially lowering off onto them.","{105890157: 3, 110906588: 3, 108178915: 3, 107852661: 3, 107698881: 3, 107739229: 3, 111824864: 3, 107051495: 3, 200121608: 3, 113489466: 3, 200101052: 3, 107174265: 3, 107419765: 3, 111278312: 2, 105832216: 2, 200423818: 2, 110317485: 2, 200268120: 2, 107346586: 2, 110262051: 2, 112134112: 2, 106897206: 2, 105875389: 2, 112463509: 2, 110580188: 2, 106486112: 2, 105885115: 2, 105906559: 2, 107434457: 2, 108933008: 2, 106125724: 2, 108245758: 2, 107621814: 2, 106726952: 2, 106876126: 2, 106971875: 2, 106417094: 1, 200409215: 1, 105933166: 1, 105963968: 1, 110462676: 1, 111810451: 1, 106720416: 1, 111841723: 1, 111488411: 1, 106449525: 1, 109018792: 1, 105943577: 1, 107851075: 1}"

Wildly-exposed climbing interesting fun moves on good holds; it would be hard to find anything negative to say about this climb (except maybe that it is an exfoliating death trap). Its main feature is a crazy rock fin jutting out 80 feet above the ground. You will learn to love this feature or you will find yourself catching big air.    Starting on less-interesting, moderate moves you will eventually gain a stance looking up at the business, which is the last 50 feet of the climb. Follow the bolts heading up and right on crimps and underclings until you are following the very edge of the rock fin. At this point, you will be forced to smear on small foot holds right on the edge of the flake with nothing under you for what seems to be a long, long way.

The nasty chimney corner seemed the only plausible passage out of the gully and up to the roof above, so Ryan took the lead with the drill strapped to him, and added two bolts on the way up through the wet chimney (5.8).

With positive gear placements most of the way through, it still has the potential for a clean traditional ascent with one short section of pg-13 climbing.      There two main intimidation factors to this climb.  The first is a large cammed block with a gnarly shark's fin protruding its top (""Pinky Toe of Fate??"") the use of which is absolutely necessary to make your way into the roof.  The first ascent made very delicate use of this block, and after passing it, attempted to break it or dislodge it via foot with no success.  Subsequent ascents have hauled on the block to reach up into the ceiling, and its camming structure as well rock strength at the fin seem very strong.  With the large juggy nature of the fin, it presents itself as merely psychological rather than physical intimidation.  The second intimidation factor is the crux traverse around to the face.  Fixing a draw on bolt number six is helpful, because you can clip before making the move around the corner onto the face with no risk besides a clean air drop.

Definitely.","{106588964: 3, 107898897: 3, 107878732: 3, 108050314: 3, 108276722: 3, 109105073: 3, 107803888: 3, 109006073: 3, 108179333: 3, 106054710: 3, 110259196: 3, 112010408: 3, 200324531: 3, 108106981: 3, 109371990: 3, 107734238: 2, 107783414: 2, 107470987: 2, 107207686: 2, 106306579: 2, 106417094: 2, 105913936: 2, 106430658: 2, 106710887: 2, 106834913: 2, 105941791: 2, 105941782: 2, 106860568: 2, 107555169: 2, 107430471: 2, 107257835: 2, 108073727: 2, 107852661: 2, 108181716: 2, 108167549: 2, 106360234: 2, 107651072: 2, 108188495: 2, 108595560: 2, 109077850: 2, 109272253: 2, 108590756: 2, 108245758: 2, 107942262: 2, 110459495: 2, 108138324: 2, 108436633: 2, 109692317: 2, 111816794: 2, 107494185: 2, 111868072: 2, 110494556: 2, 111872948: 2, 111902978: 2, 106876126: 2, 111844655: 2, 111181604: 2, 108266600: 2, 110231237: 2, 112100767: 2, 109026046: 2, 106741264: 2, 106990659: 2, 112255338: 2, 111657818: 2, 110762698: 2, 111650569: 2, 111142184: 2, 109683196: 2, 112365589: 2, 111573930: 2, 112846385: 2, 112025952: 2, 107327535: 2, 113164188: 2, 112230384: 2, 112091216: 2, 200259024: 2, 106858324: 2, 110756813: 2, 200150489: 2, 109414386: 2, 111878504: 2, 107739229: 2, 200437181: 2, 200374248: 2, 110524225: 2, 200485328: 2, 110915247: 2, 200423818: 2, 105832216: 2, 200086388: 2, 200129067: 2, 200825839: 2, 106702886: 1, 105938601: 1, 105906559: 1, 105885115: 1, 107617264: 1, 105886022: 1, 107838499: 1, 106103271: 1, 105898385: 1, 105910878: 1, 106054402: 1, 106074233: 1, 106125724: 1, 106426493: 1, 106134707: 1, 106486112: 1, 106615429: 1, 105890157: 1, 106751248: 1, 106397425: 1, 108244717: 1, 107851075: 1, 108157281: 1, 107698881: 1, 106709875: 1, 108894743: 1, 107746838: 1, 106423391: 1, 108923341: 1, 109581799: 1, 111150658: 1, 106917454: 1, 110315255: 1, 108290010: 1, 111968804: 1, 112164950: 1, 107346586: 1, 108200547: 1, 111414778: 1, 107265370: 1, 111921737: 1, 112051710: 1, 111277314: 1, 111733036: 1, 200101052: 1, 200074903: 1, 112797688: 1, 200157044: 1, 113437089: 1, 200296165: 1, 109467833: 1, 112166651: 1, 112568619: 1, 200249961: 1, 106538248: 1, 110985244: 1, 200392328: 1, 107222279: 1, 112859539: 1, 105943577: 0, 106253664: 0, 107126711: 0, 106108710: 0, 106967283: 0, 106421544: 0, 110900723: 0, 108177813: 0, 106928959: 0}"
Clip a Dee Doo Dah,105888037.0,Sport,105876645.0,5.3,300.0,2.0,3.1,500.0,"Two Rumney climbers were out for a hike one day. They headed up to the higher reaches of the mountain in a search for potential new routes. After bushwacking for a while, they scrambled up a low angle dirty slab in their tennis shoes in order to check out some rock above.     They unknowingly made the first ascent of what was to become Clip a Dee Doo Dah.     Locate the now cleaner large slab on the left side of Jimmy Cliff. A line of bolts rises from the lowest point of the wall and heads more or less straight upward. The climb offers two pitches of friction moves on incredibly grippy stone.     Many 5.13 climbers regularly romp up this climb because the setting is so beautiful. To descend, turn left at the top and follow a trail to the base.","{106764476: 4, 106970957: 4, 10610: 4, 107473975: 4, 105832216: 4, 105906559: 4, 105943577: 4, 106876126: 4, 105885115: 4, 107430471:

After 'they don't make a budge rock wafers' move right around on the the edge of the outside corner by a horizontal foot crack to escape from ceiling crack directly ahead in the corner. Here finish up the 'Jimmy Crack Corner' last anchor (a army surplus ring piton) . On the downer side there is lots of lichen and on the coolest side are the wafer wedged rocks in the corner to lay back on.    Unnoticed solo free climbed this west side of the Crack Corn outcrop. I had some nervous excitement from it at first from the lichen until I thought about it and understood the foot placements were being provided for and I could relax, stop trying to make them with my hands because there are reoccurring openings for my feet. The climb went faster than before and then it was over.    I passed a short v crack that goes directly up the right corner side wall, near where I started from at the birch tree. The V groove crack I free soloed this year its short and isn't much better than the other way up.","{106178530: 0, 105890157: 0}"

The fact that it is similar to Junco and Lonesome Dove means it is going to kick ass.","{106540977: 4, 106615429: 4, 106932322: 4, 108099184: 4, 106423391: 4, 107745631: 4, 108463738: 4, 109581799: 4, 112116639: 4, 109683196: 4, 110340063: 4, 200084964: 4, 108943993: 4, 200213605: 4, 110739544: 4, 200640718: 4, 106990659: 3, 106751248: 3, 106764476: 3, 107571792: 3, 107268430: 3, 105906559: 3, 105832216: 3, 10186: 3, 107475857: 3, 105839151: 3, 107032446: 3, 106103271: 3, 107512961: 3, 106096336: 3, 106235763: 3, 105899248: 3, 105843822: 3, 106549436: 3, 106134707: 3, 106239262: 3, 106707814: 3, 106486112: 3, 106593234: 3, 106784159: 3, 105890157: 3, 106860568: 3, 107126711: 3, 107944543: 3, 106441684: 3, 107555169: 3, 106928886: 3, 108193208: 3, 107985789: 3, 108195048: 3, 107257835: 3, 108181716: 3, 108338368: 3, 108222002: 3, 106360234: 3, 108188495: 3, 107620610: 3, 106588555: 3, 108711756: 3, 109077850: 3, 109199664: 3, 108202763: 3, 107740836: 3, 107748535: 3, 107169450: 3, 109597965: 3, 109638995: 3, 109349710: 3, 108547663: 3, 108265416: 3, 107803888: 3, 105859360: 3, 106397425: 3, 108521517: 3, 108085357: 3, 109648338: 3, 106936938: 3, 106538248: 3, 107687967: 3, 110592577: 3, 108276722: 3, 106579529: 3, 107820617: 3, 111066391: 3, 109371843: 3, 110317485: 3, 106108710: 3, 109328345: 3, 111902978: 3, 108290010: 3, 107412430: 3, 107629960: 3, 109505100: 3, 107876007: 3, 112010408: 3, 111857342: 3, 110224429: 3, 112338943: 3, 110211008: 3, 111682044: 3, 112365589: 3, 108029322: 3, 111278312: 3, 112846385: 3, 200083597: 3, 112255797: 3, 112079214: 3, 200091344: 3, 112189841: 3, 200063336: 3, 112140841: 3, 111822624: 3, 112926469: 3, 109017895: 3, 111047210: 3, 112134112: 3, 112340080: 3, 200283698: 3, 109301302: 3, 111344408: 3, 108235470: 3, 200324531: 3, 200063563: 3, 112149244: 3, 106527045: 3, 112480961: 3, 108106981: 3, 106646308: 3, 112166651: 3, 112172937: 3, 106858324: 3, 200145579: 3, 200129067: 3, 200160322: 3, 112354658: 3, 200366582: 3, 7128541: 3, 200399381: 3, 200253316: 3, 200844267: 3, 200469253: 3, 200120733: 3, 200711420: 3, 108148725: 3, 200691002: 3, 106853290: 2, 107532062: 2, 107694526: 2, 105927660: 2, 107434457: 2, 105943577: 2, 106876126: 2, 107838499: 2, 107066178: 2, 105898385: 2, 106075659: 2, 105801876: 2, 106347294: 2, 106358364: 2, 106125724: 2, 105885115: 2, 106710887: 2, 105963968: 2, 106897206: 2, 107085584: 2, 107723439: 2, 106719610: 2, 106971875: 2, 106098789: 2, 107851075: 2, 107630444: 2, 106957118: 2, 108200086: 2, 105913936: 2, 107529337: 2, 108894743: 2, 108367150: 2, 108245758: 2, 108266600: 2, 106967283: 2, 107739229: 2, 106210225: 2, 111181604: 2, 108245344: 2, 111909917: 2, 111091265: 2, 111968804: 2, 109230273: 2, 109692317: 2, 200051409: 2, 112051710: 2, 107883961: 2, 109414386: 2, 200159460: 2, 200321317: 2, 200319558: 2, 109467833: 2, 200187667: 2, 200219050: 2, 200319717: 2, 107346586: 2, 110336734: 2, 110689679: 2, 200302765: 2, 112042073: 2, 200124802: 2, 200407762: 2, 200292349: 2, 200183282: 2, 200825839: 2, 200074424: 2, 107492957: 1, 107688970: 1, 107639861: 1, 111414778: 1, 200252514: 1, 200372430: 1}"

Jimmy Crack Corn,106892515.0,Trad,105876645.0,5.6,200.0,4.0,0.5,4.0,"The first pitch goes up diagonally to the beginning of the broken rock area. this first section isn't bolted and there isn't gear but the climbing isn't bad. Maybe the start to finish could stay this way on the first pitch. I free solo it or bring up a rope via right sided rock ramp to trees. Lots of secure foot holds on the rock. No pro for the first 40 ft. first time wasn't sure how easy. Climb is (5.2) zone. The dirt at the trees is okay to reach the rock to step off of onto the face (5.4) but belay first. Near top of face I ended here at a stopper crack and for rappel also 2 bolts. I came back and met Lee Hansche before I got started going up again from the step off. Lee's been somewhere up here before.    Today I went the rest of the way to the top. First on some dry moss before the forest left of the belay higher up. Not good. I bolted some good rock headwall left of where I went up (2 bolts). It'll be better but way harder to climb over on the left side of that wall. It has lichen left of the bolts and after the lichen and rock (5.6) there are oak trees for belay. It's tight foot space and decent enough. My accomplishment, I packed up and walked up to next wall (a boxed in section where the oak trees end). the next belay. I was packed ready for going home with my rock shoes on. I went up the middle and stayed that way until I backed off and proceeded fully loaded left into the steep. I climbed up the boxed in corner wall until I could move left and up on thin flakes crux (5.5) for 12ft. Then out under an awesome ceiling by a difficult access made onto grass for feet first and then a bush ledge. Up from here is the crack in the forest of lichen available to climb. That wonderful crack for me and walls covered in lichen were not a problem. I payed attention to how carefully I stepped out to get this 20ft. (5.3) crack event done. There are harder options to be had lower and up now. The first time I went leftward up so that I could head rightward up until I stepped over a six inch fissure cornered to a two ft. fissure. Cool and after that basically the climb was done 40ft? I headed left towards Clip-a-dee-doo-dah to go down. I'm psyched to do this climb without the drill. I will carry a small trad. rack.  Including the dirt ramps this climb will go up 200ft. from where it starts. Central part of the boxed in corner goes nowhere. The climb still has committing run outs. There are climbers below this climb and the rock quality of the third pitch inside wall flakes start out weak flakey edged rock and gets stronger the higher up you go. These flakes are a little runout.","{105890157: 1, 106178530: 1, 106967283: 0, 105906559: 0}"

Lady and the Tramp,106057108.0,Sport,105876645.0,5.4,250.0,2.0,2.6,168.0,The newer bolted route on the slabs at the left end of Jimmy Cliff.  One step more challenging than its neighbor to the left but still quite moderate and fun.     Pitch 1: Climb the slab following nice new bolts to the comfortable ledge with bolt anchor.     pitch 2: This pitch continues up and a little left over a bulge or 2 that make you think more than any of the other routes on the slabs.  Follow bolts to anchors at the top.     This route was a good addition since Clipity is fairly popular and can get clogged on a busy day.,"{106764476: 4, 106486112: 4, 106720416: 4, 106773417: 4, 109212991: 4, 106917454: 4, 112118431: 4, 111888705: 4, 108894876: 4, 111511868: 4, 110980157: 4, 200154540: 4, 107830036: 4, 200425297: 4, 111916761: 4, 106469016: 3, 107573329: 3, 107473975: 3, 107702396: 3, 106178530: 3, 105922881: 3, 106257523: 3, 106306579: 3, 106358364: 3, 106600250: 3, 106590583: 3, 106886078: 3, 106971875: 3, 107126711: 3, 106890805: 3, 107450109: 3, 108093743: 3, 107740836: 3, 108011499: 3, 106767880: 3, 107373999: 3, 105913936: 3, 108894743: 3, 107852661: 3, 107107345: 3, 106745162: 3, 108245758: 3, 108547663: 3, 109545197: 3, 106967283: 3, 107385412: 3, 108179333: 3, 107686628: 3, 107763339: 3, 109410883: 3, 111642674: 3, 108290010: 3, 110522591: 3, 111520764: 3, 109581184: 3, 108187175: 3, 109324282: 3, 109086735: 3, 112066146: 3, 111136253: 3, 109136692: 3, 108222002: 3, 107090485: 3, 112411512: 3, 110762698: 3, 111811598: 3, 112507024: 3, 108985245: 3, 112480961: 3, 200096522: 3, 107873850: 3, 109280499: 3, 200074903: 3, 111999314: 3, 107346586: 3, 110989228: 3, 113164188: 3, 108181716: 3, 111737844: 3, 200312793: 3, 200312756: 3, 200041302: 3, 110756813: 3, 200032274: 3, 111004308: 3, 111610436: 3, 200101052: 3, 106788981: 3, 200374248: 3, 200485328: 3, 112138817: 3, 200402086: 3, 200523527: 3, 111203516: 3, 200358908: 3, 108048090: 3, 200249961: 3, 106567319: 2, 107629960: 2, 106868421: 2, 105906559: 2, 105943577: 2, 107340581: 2, 105980259: 2, 106074233: 2, 106020029: 2, 106715896: 2, 106751248: 2, 106822110: 2, 105890157: 2, 107266915: 2, 106679659: 2, 106860568: 2, 106134707: 2, 106928886: 2, 106417094: 2, 108050314: 2, 107701820: 2, 107430471: 2, 108462136: 2, 107782738: 2, 109523045: 2, 107739229: 2, 107942262: 2, 108323817: 2, 106722338: 2, 106054710: 2, 110327172: 2, 111974624: 2, 105816622: 2, 106193141: 2, 108179890: 2, 109163797: 2, 111657818: 2, 111344408: 2, 111573930: 2, 108406663: 2, 106421544: 2, 200078875: 2, 200109224: 2, 106440310: 2, 200157044: 2, 107783937: 2, 200296165: 2, 112042073: 2, 111837902: 2, 108981414: 2, 112207022: 2, 107851075: 2, 112261455: 2, 110985244: 2, 110530156: 2, 109057647: 2, 200395157: 2, 112401943: 2, 200469947: 2, 200366582: 2, 200815206: 2, 110591893: 2, 111142184: 2, 107253738: 1, 107499312: 1, 108073727: 1, 110409351: 1, 107336862: 1, 111875474: 1, 106990659: 1}"
Lonesome Dove,105879126.0,Sport,105876645.0,5.10a,0.0,1.0,3.6,728.0,"Lonesome Dove climbs the blunt arete on the right side of the cliff. It is a fairly sustained slab route. I thought the crux was right around the second or third bolt. Above this, the climbing remains sustained, working up small edges and small holds. The last moves getting to the anchors are interesting. You can either go the right and undercling a large flake or use an easy crack system to the left. Fun route that is worth the wait.","{106985791: 4, 107429770: 4, 106822110: 4, 106970957: 4, 106928886: 4, 107119375: 4, 106764476: 4, 107256302: 4, 107268430: 4, 105876485: 4, 105832216: 4,

Clip the first couple bolts on Drilling for Dollars 5.8 and rather than breaking left on that route climb straight up the corner (trad gear) to the anchor of To Love Honor and Belay. Some interesting balance moves on the upper section.

The climbing is a cool combination of stemming and awkward positioning.     You may encounter some loose rock, but it is easy to avoid.      This route is a fairly new addition to the crag and is a good way to help deal with the crowds that can gather here on busy days.

Pine Tree Crack,106057097.0,Trad,105876645.0,5.4,250.0,1.0,2.5,59.0,"A really fun and super moderate trad climb. A good place to practice the techniques you will need on multi-pitch slab climbs on cliffs like Whitehorse, such as rope management and switching over belays.     Pitch 1: Start at a nice perch at the base of the slab on the left. Go up smooth sticky slab then up a natural stair case in the rock (good placements at the top of bulge). Continue up slabs and cracks toward a nice crack above. Climb the crack until it is necessary to break right on the slab and up to the tree belay.     Pitch 2: A short pitch up the slab above the tree to the top. Belay from trees.     What I like to do when I'm teaching multi-pitch climbing and belay techniques is to break the route in to 3 or 4 short pitches to get max experience in changeovers and building trad anchors. There are a bunch of spots to do this.","{108222002: 4, 107740836: 4, 200084964: 4, 111692304: 4, 107852661: 3, 108736383: 3, 110317485: 3, 108257055: 3, 109586477: 3, 108188613: 3, 111919506: 3, 111914048: 3, 109410883: 3, 106679659: 3, 107346586: 3, 112116113: 3, 110327172: 3, 108181716: 3, 200232501: 3, 111610436: 3, 200469947: 3, 106538248: 3, 106554048: 3, 106590583: 3, 105906559: 3, 107870857: 3, 107702396: 3, 106469016: 3, 105943577: 2, 106440310: 2, 105922881: 2, 106928886: 2, 111700011: 2, 107493129: 2, 200101052: 2, 106074233: 2, 110524225: 2, 200402086: 2, 107552617: 2, 106917454: 2, 200423818: 2, 107532062: 2, 108011499: 2, 106306579: 2, 106417094: 2, 108245758: 2, 107126711: 2, 106967283: 2, 110452119: 2, 105890157: 2, 111204114: 2, 107340026: 2, 106103271: 2, 109711410: 2, 111031033: 2, 106588964: 2, 112134112: 2, 200335317: 2, 106751248: 1}"

Move up direct to move across left to lesser angled foot ledges and go up to reach the rock protrusion ahead left. Crux  awkwardly over it and move up right to move back left at the boulder. The creepy boulder is solid enough and I used it solidly to move left. Above left of the boulder is a break in the wall. High up through this break are good handholds. Move through the break to the main cliff easily. High right step up on a narrow ledge. Crux to get to the pine tree midway up the cliff. Problematic tree climbing with a backpack on. There are really good cracks and I avoided the tree as much as possible. Great location standing above the tree. Climb up and go farthest left to the outside corner edge. Across is Lonesome Dove cliff. Climb the steeply angled outside corner (5.4) exposed and protection would be a slung horn. The higher rock on the horn is solidly stacked but eerily there. After that a short slab to the top. Route doesn't look good from the ground but is mostly clean rock climbing after 40ft.     Some days I get the gumption to free solo on sight climbs. So I did. Poor protection at the start up and through the break to the main cliff (40ft) After that the pro is decent. After the climb, climb higher and reach cairn.

The gully is a direct line between Clip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah and Lady and The Tramp. The gully is fun but has a sense of adventure.    The line climbs independently through the first pitch, but I would suggest using the first belay station of Lady and The Tramp so you have a safe belay for bringing up your second.     P1: climb up the low angle gully using whatever protection you can (its sparse at best). When you can traverse right to Lady and The Tramp belay. This pitch is all trad protected.    P2: Step back left into the gully and climb up until you meet up with Lady and The Tramp when it breaks left. When you hit the bolts of Lady and The Tramp you have two options: 1) finish up The second half of P2 of Lady and The Tramp (recommended with trad and bolted protection) or 2) keep going straight up the dirty gully to thrash through the brush to belay from one of the many trees.

Best climb of the four on the right side of the alcove.","{107347962: 4, 106054710: 4, 112229180: 4, 200600982: 4, 107573329: 3, 107256302: 3, 105996406: 3, 106271741: 3, 106257523: 3, 106421243: 3, 106600250: 3, 106715896: 3, 106834913: 3, 106469016: 3, 106860562: 3, 107629487: 3, 108110667: 3, 108134066: 3, 108050314: 3, 108867086: 3, 108462136: 3, 108436633: 3, 109284277: 3, 108547663: 3, 110431518: 3, 110445741: 3, 108138324: 3, 107745631: 3, 110522591: 3, 110974445: 3, 109581799: 3, 110317485: 3, 109135839: 3, 111031033: 3, 107000115: 3, 110842632: 3, 110494556: 3, 107929356: 3, 111169936: 3, 109324282: 3, 109026046: 3, 110750765: 3, 111181604: 3, 200067962: 3, 200095778: 3, 106679659: 3, 106788981: 3, 200123481: 3, 112086555: 3, 110989228: 3, 112160410: 3, 110735872: 3, 106440310: 3, 112338674: 3, 200101052: 3, 200074903: 3, 111825461: 3, 200220295: 3, 200312793: 3, 200154910: 3, 106433664: 3, 200349206: 3, 107768989: 3, 110452119: 3, 200485328: 3, 110530156: 3, 113077588: 3, 200469253: 3, 106191055: 3, 200591925: 3, 200253316: 3, 200634716: 3, 200568481: 3, 112401943: 3, 106434727: 2, 106970957: 2, 107268430: 2, 107629960: 2, 107336862: 2, 10186: 2, 105906559: 2, 107434457: 2, 105943577: 2, 106178530: 2, 106912253: 2, 107740836: 2, 107838499: 2, 105938601: 2, 107470987: 2, 106590583: 2, 106103271: 2, 106124998: 2, 106358364: 2, 106399334: 2, 106417094: 2, 106426859: 2, 105922881: 2, 106720416: 2, 106125724: 2, 106486112: 2, 106205646: 2, 105890157: 2, 106971875: 2, 106928959: 2, 107126711: 2, 107430471: 2, 107898897: 2, 107723439: 2, 106312507: 2, 108049103: 2, 106868421: 2, 108145511: 2, 106397425: 2, 106360234: 2, 108188495: 2, 107852661: 2, 105913936: 2, 108595560: 2, 107492957: 2, 109020715: 2, 108222065: 2, 108157281: 2, 109090889: 2, 109157864: 2, 109105073: 2, 106561728: 2, 107698881: 2, 107727480: 2, 108202763: 2, 108222002: 2, 109027015: 2, 109090119: 2, 108245758: 2, 108265416: 2, 109545197: 2, 110262256: 2, 110459495: 2, 106967283: 2, 109006073: 2, 109692317: 2, 107942262: 2, 110638625: 2, 110705741: 2, 111142184: 2, 111091265: 2, 111783002: 2, 110315255: 2, 111902978: 2, 108290010: 2, 106876126: 2, 111974624: 2, 112010408: 2, 110356941: 2, 106917454: 2, 111656243: 2, 110395141: 2, 108301940: 2, 110580188: 2, 107346586: 2, 106990659: 2, 111857342: 2, 111682044: 2, 110762698: 2, 112846385: 2, 200076325: 2, 112025952: 2, 113164188: 2, 107059069: 2, 112149244: 2, 111328484: 2, 200170409: 2, 108257055: 2, 200167620: 2, 106210225: 2, 200157044: 2, 200265615: 2, 111004308: 2, 109526908: 2, 200150489: 2, 112166651: 2, 107699201: 2, 200374248: 2, 112568619: 2, 111878504: 2, 200437181: 2, 112261455: 2, 110739544: 2, 111844655: 2, 109371990: 2, 200432921: 2, 200078875: 2, 110915247: 2, 107739229: 2, 200423818: 2, 105832216: 2, 200129067: 2, 200297969: 2, 110591893: 2, 200825839: 2, 200551938: 2, 200469646: 2, 107851075: 2, 106751248: 1, 105839151: 1, 106075659: 1, 105898385: 1, 106306579: 1, 106134707: 1, 106239262: 1, 107969579: 1, 108894743: 1, 106709875: 1, 108244717: 1, 107169450: 1, 106538248: 1, 107100666: 1, 109317339: 1, 112138817: 1, 112255338: 1, 111573930: 1, 108200547: 1, 112051710: 1, 109932626: 1, 106646308: 1, 200319717: 1, 200408941: 1, 200574265: 1}"

When Pigs Fly,106865476.0,Trad,105876645.0,5.6,100.0,1.0,1.3,3.0,This is an old style climb in an old style area across from Jimmy Cliff. The moves up are  similar to the climbs on the right side of the main cliff. The climbing is a little bit dirty. This climb offers ramps and some wonderful rock protrusions. Plenty of exposure on it. High up moves to start with are high up. A wonderful view after the climb.    A difficulty increase variation to this climb awaits on the same fixed protection a left sided climb on the first three bolts. This variation is on clean black rock and run out distance. The ceiling ahead below the upper slab can also be pulled on up the left side for added difficulty. I would call the whole variation 'Pigs On The Wing'.    We really enjoyed our climb. Finally my daughter got to be in on one of my first ascents in a new area. The crux is getting past the second bolt and the ceiling below the upper slab. The upper slab can be skipped by a nice alternative finish. Go right before slab and pass a pine tree at (5.5) to join up later the regular finish.,"{105890157: 2, 106178530: 2, 106967283: 0}"

This route climbs the left, then the right side of the striking arete/roof via technical and satisfying moves.      Begin on the face directly below the arete with a ramp-like feature to your right.  Ascend up, then make a couple exciting moves left beneath a low roof to a mantle shelf.  Next, climb up the orange face, trending right until you are on good, but not great, holds beneath the right side of the roof.  Look right around the corner once you are below the roof and clip a bolt.  Make an exciting step around right onto the upper face and climb to the top.

The description of the area is accurate. It is unblemished of any bolts and pitons. It is a place for a climber to become one with nature as all the other acsents have been.

From the anchors head left and up a steep face, then make a pumpy traverse right under a roof before pulling it and tackling the final steepness to gain a nice belay ledge.    If you want to keep the adventure going, belay here and continue up The Thing for a third pitch. If stopping, you are a little too high to simply lower to the Iron Man ledge unless you have a 70m. You will have to do it in two drops, using the Thin Man Anchors. Alternatively, rapping off the Via Ferrata anchors 20 feet over, on the right side of the belay ledge, will get you down with a 60m in one drop.

Once the crack is passed, the climbing remains pumpy until a great kneebar can be found. Rest here and then negotiate The Cave, a square cutout in the rock.

Fear of Abraham,106098583.0,Trad,105874223.0,5.6,0.0,1.0,1.8,49.0,Placing gear in schist is often tricky due to the strange grain of the rock. I recommend practicing placing gear at Rumney on routes like this because when you get out on granite or sandstone the gear seems so obvious and easy to place in comparison. It's also a great route to warm up on if you are getting on the routes in the 5.8 to 5.10 range that are found in the vicinity.     Climb the left facing left leaning crack/flake below the big ledge at Main Cliff's central area just right of the leaning boulder. After laying back and finger locking you will get to a few moderate face moves that lead to a nice stance and the 2 bolt anchor. The cool texture on the first half of the route make for really nice foot options.The gear can be tricky but solid.,"{200371045: 4, 105906559: 3, 108463738: 3, 110705741: 3, 109324282: 3, 111982697: 3, 106297463: 3, 112401943: 3, 107346586: 2, 106397425: 2, 106953219: 2, 108245758: 2, 106957265: 2, 110638625: 2, 200293863: 2, 110317485: 2, 200232501: 2, 107739229: 2, 105913936: 2, 105922881: 2, 106306579: 2, 106486112: 2, 106868421: 2, 107555169: 2, 106113062: 2, 108222002: 2, 107852661: 2, 106971875: 2, 200445602: 1, 106646308: 1, 105832216: 1, 200265615: 1, 200469947: 1, 112207022: 1, 106191055: 1, 200150170: 1, 112176219: 1, 109692317: 1, 106967283: 1, 106360234: 1, 110756813: 1, 10610: 1, 106876126: 1, 110155662: 1, 110592577: 1, 105885115: 1, 111610436: 1, 105816622: 1, 112166651: 1}"
Going Nuts,106289049.0,Sport,105874223.0,5.13b,0.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,"Previously called Soup To Nuts and graded 5.12c this route suffered the loss of THE key hold on the route. A big jug in the steep wall. Over the past 5 years numerous people have tried to figure out a sequence through the nearly blank wall. I myself inspected the route at least 5 times before being able discover a solution. Due to the severity of the change to the route and the years it took to see another ascent I thought it was appropriate to re-name it. The new solution is unfortunately a bit height dependent but all the same I am glad that the line has been proven possible again as a line of useless bolts is a sad thing on a pretty wall.  Pitch one: 5.7 Climb the first pitch of Rock Du Jours to the two bolt anchor.  Pitch 2: Follow eye bolts up and left from the anchor then out right to a slab ledge below a steep bulge. Hand traverse up and right along a good ledge beneath the bulge to a solid clipping hold and get ready for a short but stouts series of moves on crimps (V7/8?). My sequence from the jug used a minuscule right hand side-pull with an equally tiny thumb catch. With my left foot on the ledge I used a left hand under-cling crimp to shift left and do a big (height dependent) move with the left hand to a hold in an awkward undercling/sidepull position. With some intense core engagement I went up right hand to a ""jug"" matched it and moved right and back into the same finish the original route continued on. This is a series of edges that after what you just climbed, will feel pretty mellow. Difficulty continues to ease as you move up and on to the anchor of Rock Du Jours.","{105906559: 2, 105885115: 2}"

Goldbug,105963695.0,Sport,105874223.0,5.10d,0.0,1.0,2.6,171.0,This is the corner climb between Know Ethics(5.10d) and Gold Digger(5.8+). It shares the hard technical nature of its neighbor to the left without being quite as hair raising (for some reason Know Ethics can be a bit heady).     As with all the climbs in this section start up easy ground on good holds for the first 20 or so feet and get nestled in to the corner where the business happens. Solid stemming and trust in your feet are a must on this one. Work your way somewhat awkwardly up the well protected crux corner to a stance above. At this point you meet up with Gold Digger (5.8+) right before its crux. Instead of going out right like that route you want to make a few more hard moves straight up and on to the anchors.,"{105913936: 4, 106306579: 4, 107409316: 4, 108358223: 4, 107852661: 4, 106449525: 4, 110705741: 4, 108463738: 4, 111902978: 4, 112230384: 4, 200136973: 4, 111871900: 4, 7058825: 4, 105890157: 3, 106876126: 3, 105943577: 3, 105839151: 3, 106075659: 3, 106764476: 3, 107540375: 3, 105832216: 3, 105898385: 3, 105938601: 3, 106125724: 3, 10610: 3, 105899248: 3, 106134707: 3, 106054402: 3, 106971875: 3, 107347295: 3, 106917454: 3, 106928886: 3, 106397425: 3, 107257835: 3, 108003242: 3, 108181716: 3, 108276722: 3, 106239262: 3, 107630444: 3, 107620610: 3, 106538248: 3, 107729640: 3, 108014034: 3, 109638995: 3, 108245758: 3, 107617264: 3, 108193208: 3, 109692317: 3, 108082584: 3, 111091265: 3, 111066391: 3, 110138155: 3, 111142184: 3, 108967041: 3, 108857621: 3, 105859360: 3, 111682044: 3, 111909917: 3, 110365118: 3, 107629960: 3, 109467833: 3, 108032974: 3, 106990659: 3, 112352056: 3, 108324210: 3, 200101883: 3, 107820434: 3, 112079214: 3, 112365589: 3, 106647777: 3, 109328345: 3, 111888281: 3, 200151025: 3, 200152826: 3, 110762698: 3, 112387855: 3, 111022013: 3, 112207022: 3, 110714075: 3, 200263422: 3, 110756813: 3, 111810451: 3, 112164950: 3, 110942549: 3, 110494556: 3, 200129067: 3, 111071864: 3, 110262051: 3, 200277103: 3, 200145579: 3, 200325096: 3, 200060911: 3, 200084683: 3, 109406130: 3, 107169450: 3, 105906559: 2, 105879342: 2, 105963968: 2, 107470987: 2, 106103271: 2, 107655644: 2, 106271741: 2, 106347294: 2, 106229076: 2, 106358364: 2, 106145409: 2, 106710887: 2, 106486112: 2, 106158262: 2, 106670299: 2, 106702886: 2, 107126711: 2, 106860568: 2, 106868421: 2, 107555169: 2, 107851075: 2, 106417094: 2, 107178254: 2, 106967283: 2, 109006252: 2, 108367150: 2, 109324282: 2, 109608840: 2, 108200547: 2, 109371843: 2, 108726865: 2, 106957265: 2, 107492957: 2, 107942262: 2, 106251687: 2, 107820617: 2, 106108710: 2, 108222002: 2, 108290010: 2, 111081279: 2, 108652563: 2, 108301940: 2, 107346586: 2, 109383300: 2, 110900723: 2, 107327535: 2, 111777299: 2, 107260705: 2, 200159460: 2, 109884427: 2, 200006438: 2, 112823201: 2, 112846385: 2, 109017895: 2, 107085584: 2, 200319558: 2, 200101052: 2, 111167972: 2, 107711888: 2, 110739544: 2, 109648338: 2, 111878504: 2, 107739229: 2, 111844655: 2, 106646308: 2, 111181604: 2, 200063563: 2, 110591893: 2, 200399381: 2, 200604841: 2, 200316373: 2, 107796034: 1, 105961696: 1, 108145511: 1, 111841723: 1}"

Head up following the eyebolts up the steep face which is climbed for the most part on very straight forward crimps. The first crux is about halfway up the crimp section where the feet sort of aren't where you want them (kind of missing a right foot). Just paste your foot and go. ""Thank god"" crimps above this hard move give you a shake out and get you to the sloper finish. Once you mantel, the anchor awaits.

Many a climber has lowered off only to say, ""That was the hardest 5.10 I have ever done.""    Though desperate, the climb is well protected with bolts. Climb up easy schist until below the orange corner. A hard pull deposits you into the corner at which point it might be helpful to think, ""palms."" And maybe ""stems."" Continue up the corner until it is possible to move left. You probably want to get out of the corner at this point anyway.     A hard move then leads back right, across the top of the corner, back into the gray schist. Easier moves give way to the anchor that, unlike almost every route on the wall, does not have quick clips.

Peanut Man,105874232.0,Sport,105874223.0,5.12a,75.0,1.0,3.4,152.0,"Peanut Man climbs up the center of Main Cliff proper. Scramble from the ground (easy class four) and gain the raised ledge. Belay at an eyebolt on the far right side of the ledge.     The climb starts out with fun, insecure, 5.10ish climbing up steep orange corners. After passing a piton (it's not necessary to clip this) it is possible to rest off a jug at the top of the orange rock. From here, the rock turns to schist, and if you think that the bulge threatens over you like a black raincloud, then you are entirely correct.    The bulge presents the crux of the route--an upward stab into the obvious undercling. The difficulties continue, however, as the holds turn into slopers, leaving the climber grasping for purchase on the rounded topout. A few easier moves lead to the anchors.    Many shorter people think this climb is harder. A long reach helps a great deal on the final topout.      Note: Peanut Man got the big upgrade (from 11d to 12a) because of a hold breaking on October 18, 2010.","{106011053: 4, 106239262: 4, 106030548: 4, 107002071: 4, 107294932: 4, 105898385: 4, 106440358: 4, 105938601: 4, 106347294: 4, 106273389: 4, 106670299: 4, 106842434: 4, 106702886: 4, 106646308: 4, 106775653: 4, 107377680: 4, 106360234: 4, 106616366: 4, 107852661: 4, 108276722: 4, 105926739: 4, 108340305: 4, 108245758: 4, 108266600: 4, 108181716: 4, 106538248: 4, 108188613: 4, 106536458: 4, 108082584: 4, 107492957: 4, 106108710: 4, 107941619: 4, 11509: 4, 107574666: 4, 111150658: 4, 110259196: 4, 110813639: 4, 106075659: 4, 107260705: 4, 108166735: 4, 111278312: 4, 106922041: 4, 200223489: 4, 106890179: 4, 108222002: 4, 200148250: 4, 108394010: 4, 111030282: 4, 111781359: 4, 111181604: 4, 109317339: 4, 107169450: 4, 112439618: 4, 110446085: 4, 200056643: 4, 110262051: 4, 110756813: 4, 200063563: 4, 200488767: 4, 200602398: 4, 107533223: 4, 107355157: 4, 200257412: 4, 106957265: 4, 109406130: 4, 109255473: 4, 111878504: 4, 106189019: 4, 200319717: 4, 112207022: 4, 108032974: 4, 109467833: 4, 10610: 3, 105832216: 3, 105885115: 3, 107655644: 3, 105891399: 3, 105906559: 3, 107628457: 3, 105963968: 3, 105943577: 3, 106876126: 3, 106139012: 3, 106151063: 3, 12525: 3, 106271741: 3, 106486112: 3, 105890157: 3, 106720416: 3, 106125724: 3, 105879342: 3, 107126711: 3, 106134707: 3, 107178254: 3, 108003242: 3, 105960152: 3, 106971875: 3, 107085584: 3, 108726865: 3, 107469950: 3, 107457259: 3, 106397425: 3, 109638995: 3, 107009084: 3, 106578430: 3, 108290010: 3, 109648338: 3, 110668667: 3, 112142214: 3, 109692317: 3, 111741206: 3, 109383300: 3, 108367150: 3, 109328345: 3, 109371843: 3, 108364795: 3, 200136973: 3, 109585594: 3, 107183979: 3, 112797688: 3, 110430741: 3, 112322643: 3, 111364728: 3, 110675365: 3, 108943993: 3, 107711888: 3, 107102487: 3, 200253647: 3, 107346586: 3, 111710269: 3, 200319558: 3, 200057419: 3, 112352056: 3, 200359801: 3, 107858105: 3, 200060911: 3, 200828456: 3, 200316373: 3, 200743333: 3, 200665016: 3, 7128541: 3, 106967283: 3, 200711420: 3, 106492500: 2, 107969579: 2, 109101477: 2, 109006073: 2, 110900723: 2, 105798365: 2, 111841723: 2, 106146571: 2, 109884427: 1}"

Many have trusted the smear and have stood up, only to encounter thirty feet of hyper technical smearing and edging. Many others, however, have taken the whip.

Just right of Gold Digger, climb up to an easy right leaning scrambly ramp to get you up on the buttress, then, using a bucket sidepull, step up a little left onto the wall proper, then angle up right into a nice corner, following the eyebolts to an excellent belay ledge. 5.7 (Breaking off left and following another corner with regular hangered bolts is a 5.7 way to get to the second pitch anchor of Goldbug, and the start of The Thang)Pitch 2 Now for the main course! Head out left on the big flake system past a couple bolts. Stay low on the flakes and keep traversing until you are about 8 feet past the last bolt in the overhang and it starts to feel scary, then mantel and head up a short slab to a notch with an overhang above. Note - It can be confusing with the bolts on the slab. There is a bolt out left after doing the initial flake traverse from the belay (reg hanger) from an old project. Don't let it pull you off route. Stick with the fat galvanized glue-ins through there, but also don’t break right too early into Going Nuts or you will quickly be into 13 territory.Once up the short slab, undercling and reach the top of the overhang and hand traverse right until you can mantel over. Get a shake, then head right around the arete into the exposure and up. Finishes straight up on flakes to a bolted anchor. From here, lower (don't rap) back to the belay.  You will need to get a little swing going or carefully get pulled in to get back to the belay, as the wall overhangs some. Have the second clean the route and tram back to you.From the mid  belay you can just get down to the base the way you came with a 60m rope. Be especially careful of loose stones on your descent and while pulling the rope as there are usually people below. This route is a great outing with excellent positioning and views of the Main Cliff and the Baker River valley below.The 2nd pitch leader should be comfortable with 5.9 as the traverse moves off the first anchor are relatively stiff and intimidating (good positive holds though ;-)  The top anchor is out of sight and good hearing from the mid belay, so have your routine worked out and well communicated before you head off.","{106486112: 4, 106134707: 4, 106358784: 4, 106942612: 4, 107222279: 4, 107257835: 4, 108222002: 4, 107688321: 4, 106957265: 4, 107698881: 4, 108287262: 4, 108363423: 4, 107852661: 4, 108311593: 4, 107739229: 4, 107969579: 4, 108598790: 4, 106978267: 4, 105816622: 4, 107929356: 4, 108032974: 4, 111982697: 4, 111167972: 4, 200067677: 4, 110293668: 4, 112134112: 4, 110315255: 4, 112322643: 4, 111657384: 4, 110274904: 4, 200221078: 4, 110762698: 4, 112261455: 4, 200113951: 4, 106529776: 4, 110714075: 4, 107783414: 4, 200450654: 4, 200107036: 4, 110712867: 4, 113187400: 4, 109393254: 4, 200604841: 4, 111741206: 4, 200057419: 4, 7128541: 4, 112091056: 4, 200358728: 4, 108844858: 4, 106726952: 3, 105885115: 3, 105906559: 3, 107579039: 3, 107492957: 3, 105898385: 3, 106271741: 3, 106561728: 3, 106720416: 3, 106125724: 3, 107051495: 3, 105890157: 3, 106702886: 3, 107126711: 3, 107555169: 3, 106876126: 3, 106360234: 3, 108188495: 3, 108200086: 3, 107942262: 3, 107574666: 3, 106990659: 3, 108608330: 3, 109586477: 3, 108245758: 3, 109545197: 3, 110459495: 3, 109692317: 3, 108437225: 3, 107723931: 3, 105943577: 3, 109316126: 3, 107740836: 3, 108547663: 3, 110863417: 3, 106407009: 3, 110705741: 3, 109269951: 3, 110317485: 3, 108245344: 3, 106967283: 3, 108436785: 3, 111089776: 3, 110471998: 3, 112010408: 3, 111181604: 3, 111824829: 3, 110395141: 3, 111298824: 3, 111875474: 3, 108200547: 3, 107723439: 3, 107346586: 3, 109383300: 3, 200063563: 3, 110262256: 3, 108252197: 3, 108290010: 3, 107851075: 3, 200101052: 3, 200142768: 3, 108181716: 3, 107481755: 3, 107260705: 3, 111888281: 3, 110942549: 3, 200064982: 3, 106868421: 3, 113512015: 3, 106306579: 3, 200056643: 3, 106922041: 3, 109017895: 3, 109585594: 3, 112147878: 3, 200264338: 3, 107232890: 3, 107768989: 3, 112207022: 3, 200078397: 3, 106538248: 3, 200249056: 3, 111666789: 3, 107419765: 3, 200319558: 3, 110494556: 3, 111844655: 3, 200298255: 3, 200437181: 3, 6312246: 3, 111169936: 3, 200245769: 3, 110591893: 3, 105818656: 3, 111650569: 3, 200145579: 3, 200407762: 3, 111426811: 3, 110152422: 3, 200314873: 3, 109406130: 3, 200183282: 3, 200711420: 3, 112166649: 3, 107548227: 3, 200395157: 3, 107169450: 3, 107796034: 2, 105832216: 2, 106239262: 2, 106151063: 2, 108139891: 2, 107628457: 2, 105859360: 2, 106417094: 2, 111066391: 2, 110138155: 2, 106662131: 2, 110259196: 2, 111841723: 2, 107876007: 2, 106210225: 2, 112846385: 2, 112030796: 2, 109033018: 2, 112051710: 2, 200230025: 2, 200219050: 2, 200296165: 2, 200154262: 2, 106146571: 2, 107085584: 2, 112117203: 2, 200462073: 2, 200145352: 2, 107682885: 1, 106600250: 1, 107820617: 1, 111081279: 1, 111610436: 1, 109884427: 1, 200196315: 1, 200249961: 1, 108159187: 0, 111414778: 0}"

Basically don't plan on any movement on this thing being inconsequential.  The route was first climbed by Kevin Donovan as a top rope variation. After community discussion I (Lee Hansche) helped Kevin bolt it. He came back the next day and climbed through all of the hardest climbing and fell on an easier move in the upper roof due to a hold breaking.

After the initial boulder problem, rest on the slab. Here, Rocket Man moves left into a lower angled corner. Don't let this angle fool you, as the corner holds some hyper-technical 5.12+ slab climbing.    At the top of the corner, a good edge provides a respite before the crux bulge. A huge incut jug sits above the bulge. Now, how are you to get from the edge to the jug? Most people dyno. This is not a technical deadpoint. It's more like a most-points-off jump with feet flying in the air followed by a considerable outward swing. It is possible to move left and bypass the dyno, but this may involve double thumb underclings. Really.    From the jug, a few taxing high step moves lead to the pump crux: a big move out left to a gaston-jug. Many end the route here by clipping the double bolts and moving right to a no-hands stance. This completes an ascent of ""Rocket Boy"" 5.13c/d.     To ascend the full Rocket Man, continue on easier climbing, past a 5.12ish roof to the top of the cliff. The rock quality degrades quickly, which in my eyes, makes the full Rocket Man less classic. Since it is possible to fully recover on the no-hands stance at the end of Rocket Boy, this seems a logical ending.     The full Rocket Man (all the way to the top) may only have had a few ascents.","{10610: 4, 106492500: 4, 105885115: 4, 105964192: 4, 108032974: 4, 106108710: 4, 111181604: 4, 200378501: 4}"

Either work the crack with your right hand and the arete with your left as you hug your way through the crux stabbing the slots with precision. Or, climb the crack with a super sequency collection of strong moves and tough jams (if you are good in cracks this seems easier, but not easy by a long shot).

More technical moves lead to another hanging slab and the last true rest on the route. From here, a long move up and right to a rail may stymie climbers with less reach. The technical moves continue until a big, energy sapping, deadpoint out right allows exit from the corner.     The schist overhang above is classic Rumney: weird, insecure climbing on steep rock. I have been told that a neck/shoulder scum under the roof offers a good rest. I never could find it and felt instead like my body was being pressed lengthways in a vice. There have also been rumors of a knee bar rest here--never could find that one either. Thin Man ends at an anchor on the upper ledge, about ten feet left of Peanut Man's anchors.

This will leave you on a much more comfortable ledge  and in a much better position for the 2nd pitch.","{110700033: 4, 108245758: 4, 106876126: 4, 107901211: 4, 109193524: 4, 110638625: 4, 111779719: 4, 111919506: 4, 111696814: 4, 112090791: 4, 112116639: 4, 109156558: 4, 200061302: 4, 111167972: 4, 109581799: 4, 200151702: 4, 200105749: 4, 111716091: 4, 200230025: 4, 200289394: 4, 200056643: 4, 200297969: 4, 109410883: 3, 106868421: 3, 107740836: 3, 106419027: 3, 106957265: 3, 106788981: 3, 105906559: 3, 107430471: 3, 109545197: 3, 108547663: 3, 109268194: 3, 107632893: 3, 106397425: 3, 111078134: 3, 108990414: 3, 106178530: 3, 108048090: 3, 109212991: 3, 111204114: 3, 108323817: 3, 111142184: 3, 109086735: 3, 110317485: 3, 110705741: 3, 107985832: 3, 108189638: 3, 108222002: 3, 106917454: 3, 111902978: 3, 111546553: 3, 111911639: 3, 111169936: 3, 110762698: 3, 105816622: 3, 108145511: 3, 112066146: 3, 109324282: 3, 110522591: 3, 111298824: 3, 112164950: 3, 106134707: 3, 111136253: 3, 106793247: 3, 112038160: 3, 111031033: 3, 112509814: 3, 105943577: 3, 110459495: 3, 112463509: 3, 106306579: 3, 106679659: 3, 200044847: 3, 110293668: 3, 107494185: 3, 111657384: 3, 112365589: 3, 106610663: 3, 112134112: 3, 110164501: 3, 111163750: 3, 200074903: 3, 200078875: 3, 112926469: 3, 111777806: 3, 110735872: 3, 111969490: 3, 107346586: 3, 112116113: 3, 112846385: 3, 109017895: 3, 108181716: 3, 111825461: 3, 106552384: 3, 112261455: 3, 200265615: 3, 107691094: 3, 111077991: 3, 200296165: 3, 200312793: 3, 111916761: 3, 107419765: 3, 112823201: 3, 110199810: 3, 200253280: 3, 106967283: 3, 200078397: 3, 109057647: 3, 109585594: 3, 200129067: 3, 113077522: 3, 110052234: 3, 110985244: 3, 200514843: 3, 107739229: 3, 112138370: 3, 107108243: 3, 200041302: 3, 112401943: 3, 200935928: 3, 106561728: 2, 107852661: 2, 107492957: 2, 108652563: 2, 110724330: 2, 107412430: 2, 106192059: 2, 107085584: 2, 108276722: 2, 108200547: 2, 108367353: 2, 110365118: 2, 111682044: 2, 111914048: 2, 111974624: 2, 108755979: 2, 112324365: 2, 200061631: 2, 112174305: 2, 112340080: 2, 109692317: 2, 110409351: 2, 112079214: 2, 200101052: 2, 200142768: 2, 112411512: 2, 112322643: 2, 110315255: 2, 110900723: 2, 111426811: 2, 107059376: 2, 112843761: 2, 112166651: 2, 111610436: 2, 200064120: 2, 106125724: 2, 200319558: 2, 200157044: 2, 112502336: 2, 200154262: 2, 111857342: 2, 107768989: 2, 200107036: 2, 110712867: 2, 111844655: 2, 110452119: 2, 200334316: 2, 200423818: 2, 200325096: 2, 200564551: 2, 200584602: 2, 200390866: 2, 200711420: 2, 200840998: 2, 110923255: 2, 110591893: 2, 107917066: 1, 107469950: 1, 111136212: 1, 111968804: 1, 111841723: 1, 111414778: 1, 106421544: 1, 112245330: 1, 200294199: 1, 200314873: 1}"

Honestly the fact that it eases off after the crux is a draw for me at times. It's nice to do a challenging route without having to be on edge for 10 minutes straight. If you want to get above the crowds for a bit take a spin on this one.  Climb up on the right side of the bolt line passing a small overhang and work up so you are standing on a small ledge just below the bigger overhang. clip the bolt on the roof. Make wild and fun moves out the short roof and on to the true crux, a three move sequence,  as you establish yourself above the overhang. From here the difficulty eases off considerably but it stays super fun. Work your way over and around a series of bulges with excellent exposure until you hit the final headwall. Make a few juggy but slightly steep moves past one more bolt and on to the anchor just below the true top of the cliff.  The 4th bolt, right at the crux is strenuous to clip but it is helpful for working the crux. On a redpoint attempt you might prefer to clip it at your waist after doing the crux. Seems like the falls would be safe.","{105906559: 3, 106957265: 3, 200283710: 3, 200145579: 3, 200169513: 1}"

Start by walking up a slab moving right to left. Clip a bolt mantel an easy ledge. The bulge above is one of the 5.7 moves, It is best to stay right, in line with the bolt pulling a balancy mantle into a corner. It can be tempting to move around to the left but the climbing isn't as interesting, rock is looser and bolt is farther away. Up the corner on easy ground to the base of a right facing corner with a layback crack.

Pull that and make a few easy moves around to the right of a small roof and back to the left to the chains on a slab.,"{110705741: 3, 108222002: 3, 105943577: 3, 108245758: 3, 107629960: 3, 112086555: 2, 111181604: 2, 107346586: 2, 106868421: 2, 111414778: 2, 109017895: 2, 108200547: 2, 200319717: 2, 111844655: 2, 110712867: 2, 109406130: 2, 106108710: 2, 106702886: 2, 105906559: 2, 106103271: 2, 105980259: 2, 106020029: 2, 106125724: 2, 106561728: 2, 106957265: 2, 107852661: 2, 106971875: 2, 111902978: 2, 107851075: 2, 108142770: 2, 110923255: 2, 111841723: 1, 106895019: 1}"

Wendell's Route,106057531.0,Trad,106018085.0,5.6,200.0,1.0,1.3,4.0,I know nobody is surprised when i say that i love a route that no one has ever heard of let alone climbed... But this is one more to add to the list... Sure there are better routes to climb at Rumney but why not climb them all and if your going to climb them why not enjoy your self... This is likely to be the first route at Rumney and i think it was a great pick for the times following a weakness up the full height of Main Cliff with a hair raising finish...    Pitch 1: Start as for White Toad (5.7) climbing a vegetated corner and when you get to the first pin where WT breaks right continue up and then left following the path of least resistance... Follow a wide crack up and left on slabby rock (I once heard a not to confident party cursing that they wanted a wide cam here but i didn't use one)... This will bring you to the Charity Case anchor...    Intermission: You might want to move the belay to the base of the next pitch... I think there is one bolt and some nut/tcu placements there... This is not so much a pitch as a walk on a ledge... You can run the 1st pitch out to here but then it's quite long...    Pitch 2: Wendell's second pitch starts roughly under the finish of Rock Du Jours going up 20-25 feet then heading right on a more obvious line following cracks and face holds past fixed pins and a few tricky placements. The climbing here is moderate... Just below the top you will get to a steep section where you have to traverse right (crux) in a very exposed position under some roofs that have a gunks like quality where you find your way around things rather than blasting through them... These moves are my reason for loving this route... The upper crux moves are protected by old pins but you may be able to get other gear in as well...    Lower off with a 60m rope freehanging down to the ledge and belay the follower from the charity case anchor... Have them clean the route and lower down to you...,"{109136692: 2, 105906559: 1, 108245758: 1, 106967283: 1}"
White Toad,106018089.0,Trad,106018085.0,5.7,180.0,3.0,2.7,51.0,"One of my favorite moderates at Rumney due to its fun climbing and killer exposure. If you like a feeling of adventure with your sport cragging, this climb is for you. Look for the white toads that this route is named for--they sneek up on you. If there is something smooshy in the crack you reach in to its likely to be a white toad.    Pitch 1: Start in a somewhat dirty corner up the hill from the harder sport routes in this section. Stem your way up about 20 feet to a fixed pin. Clip the pin and step out right on to a face (5.7) head straight up on nice rock with good gear to a stance under a steep section. Place a good hand sized cam above and avoid the steep stuff by traversing right along a flake then back left to a tricky move (5.7) to gain a nice belay alcove with 2 bolts. If you gain the ledge directly its about 5.9.    Pitch 2: I normally do the variation called Dead Toad (5.8) which goes out left and is all bolted. The original route however heads up the slab ramp on the right (5.6) with minimal gear then back left following bolts to a great exposed belay ledge directly above the first belay. 2 bolt anchor.     Pitch 3: This pitch is all bolted and is super exposed and fun. Climb straight up above the belay ledge following bolts until you get to a blank steep slab move right here (the farther right you go the easier. I think a few holds broke making it more attractive to go right) then back left and over a steep challenging bulge (5.7) and on to the chains at the top.    Most people lower back to the ledge from the top pitch as you would for most sport routes. Then the second can clean the route and you can pull the rope. One 60m rope stretch will get you to the ground from the second belay. Tie stopper knots in the rope ends just to be safe.","{107740836: 4, 110259196: 4, 107852661: 4, 112010408: 4, 109407684: 3, 107107345: 3, 108245758: 3, 108363423: 3, 109585728: 3, 106967283: 3, 107363666: 3, 110705741: 3, 107212540: 3, 200129067: 3, 108943993: 3, 111779719: 3, 110712867: 3, 200263054: 3, 105913936: 3, 109157864: 3, 105980259: 3, 107753769: 3, 106020029: 3, 10186: 3, 106408472: 3, 106306579: 3, 106971875: 3, 105906559: 3, 108222002: 3, 107555169: 3, 106486112: 3, 106590583: 3, 106702886: 3, 200445602: 2, 200423818: 2, 108048090: 2, 112261455: 2, 112176219: 2, 107346586: 2, 112042073: 2, 107492957: 2, 106253664: 2, 106125724: 2, 110471998: 2, 112164950: 2, 110148121: 2, 111914048: 2, 112066146: 2, 112134112: 2, 111610436: 2, 109272971: 0}"

The flow of movement on Beginner's Route is as good as any.... It's a great way for an advanced climber to warm up slow, or a beginner to hone their skills....    The climb follows a crack in a left-facing corner up a slab...mostly you stay on your feet and use the crack and a few face holds for balance...there are two comfortable rest ledges where you can load up gear placements if you are new and want some practice...at the top you climb a 10 ft slab to the quick clips....    Rumney trad climbs are few and far between, and the ones that are there often get overlooked.... Don't miss this one. A small rack is plenty, and if you don't have gear, you can climb Bolt Line (a 5.8 sport climb just to the left) and step right at the top to set up a top rope on Beginners....

Bolt Line,105923805.0,Sport,105907984.0,5.8,70.0,1.0,2.5,323.0,Bolt Line is one of the longer climbs at the Meadows and offers approximately 70 feet of fairly sustained climbing at the grade.

The crux is making an airy move left on big holds then pulling the rest of the buldge.","{106096336: 4, 105899248: 4, 106306579: 4, 106358364: 4, 105812807: 4, 106215535: 4, 111779719: 4, 108346584: 4, 111796230: 4, 200096522: 4, 200111641: 4, 200064982: 4, 109526908: 4, 200168968: 4, 200462592: 4, 200462073: 4, 110452119: 4, 200869247: 4, 107228100: 3, 105943577: 3, 105906559: 3, 105961696: 3, 105969895: 3, 106397425: 3, 107852661: 3, 107651072: 3, 106134707: 3, 106141117: 3, 107941356: 3, 106876126: 3, 107655644: 3, 106271741: 3, 106230078: 3, 106103271: 3, 106358784: 3, 106257523: 3, 105832216: 3, 106386213: 3, 106347294: 3, 106113062: 3, 110522591: 3, 106555971: 3, 106150571: 3, 106600250: 3, 106486112: 3, 106408472: 3, 106590583: 3, 106767622: 3, 106125724: 3, 106764476: 3, 106593234: 3, 105889415: 3, 106075659: 3, 106097553: 3, 106746412: 3, 106643379: 3, 106430658: 3, 106117267: 3, 106860568: 3, 106971875: 3, 106928959: 3, 107126711: 3, 106928886: 3, 106957265: 3, 107702396: 3, 108139891: 3, 108145511: 3, 108147849: 3, 108193208: 3, 108217726: 3, 107373999: 3, 107630444: 3, 107363666: 3, 106360234: 3, 108265416: 3, 108188495: 3, 106588555: 3, 108521517: 3, 107711888: 3, 106957540: 3, 108157281: 3, 107740836: 3, 109076559: 3, 106449525: 3, 107604888: 3, 107768989: 3, 107698881: 3, 108202763: 3, 107682885: 3, 109337092: 3, 108867086: 3, 108335441: 3, 109073630: 3, 109268194: 3, 107852925: 3, 109585728: 3, 109340692: 3, 108245758: 3, 109648338: 3, 108200547: 3, 108436633: 3, 107842362: 3, 108148725: 3, 107739229: 3, 108110667: 3, 109856891: 3, 109856888: 3, 110724330: 3, 110456388: 3, 106662131: 3, 110915283: 3, 110619733: 3, 110942549: 3, 110964025: 3, 107917066: 3, 108276722: 3, 107287218: 3, 110148121: 3, 111295731: 3, 110705741: 3, 111066391: 3, 111414778: 3, 111650615: 3, 108310475: 3, 111169936: 3, 110566063: 3, 110751062: 3, 111181604: 3, 110356941: 3, 111004308: 3, 111854408: 3, 107790662: 3, 109052547: 3, 111081279: 3, 111298824: 3, 111914048: 3, 112164950: 3, 109483250: 3, 107346586: 3, 112322643: 3, 112338943: 3, 110762698: 3, 106423391: 3, 111811598: 3, 112365589: 3, 108189638: 3, 111821697: 3, 112312149: 3, 112174305: 3, 108121411: 3, 200056643: 3, 108406663: 3, 107745631: 3, 112255797: 3, 112210382: 3, 108290010: 3, 200133279: 3, 111333328: 3, 200136973: 3, 112189841: 3, 200040802: 3, 110580188: 3, 109585594: 3, 108181716: 3, 200064120: 3, 108257055: 3, 200105953: 3, 200101052: 3, 200256906: 3, 200265615: 3, 107183979: 3, 200227731: 3, 200274695: 3, 200296165: 3, 200159460: 3, 110712867: 3, 110756813: 3, 200078875: 3, 200064270: 3, 110494556: 3, 109169640: 3, 110454201: 3, 106679659: 3, 111626403: 3, 200129067: 3, 107507531: 3, 200403574: 3, 200450654: 3, 112340080: 3, 200374248: 3, 200107036: 3, 200428840: 3, 200485328: 3, 109568693: 3, 200063563: 3, 112004169: 3, 110923255: 3, 200152635: 3, 200248995: 3, 200401423: 3, 200342646: 3, 106180018: 3, 112207022: 3, 200416944: 3, 200259729: 3, 112915750: 3, 200069147: 3, 200561363: 3, 111281190: 3, 110791169: 3, 200711420: 3, 108106981: 3, 200160054: 3, 200946477: 3, 200589074: 3, 106702886: 2, 107635859: 2, 107699201: 2, 105839151: 2, 106417094: 2, 105887867: 2, 107743379: 2, 106762873: 2, 105898385: 2, 106868421: 2, 105913936: 2, 106205646: 2, 105963968: 2, 105890157: 2, 106784159: 2, 106576182: 2, 106646308: 2, 107085584: 2, 106054402: 2, 107563431: 2, 108062894: 2, 106591213: 2, 108244717: 2, 108168761: 2, 108222002: 2, 107492957: 2, 105953793: 2, 108301940: 2, 108652563: 2, 107169450: 2, 109090119: 2, 105885115: 2, 107763339: 2, 108252197: 2, 109711410: 2, 107477790: 2, 107385412: 2, 105859360: 2, 109324282: 2, 106917454: 2, 108367353: 2, 110841071: 2, 111682044: 2, 107412430: 2, 108742211: 2, 110259196: 2, 112010408: 2, 111970633: 2, 107032446: 2, 109383300: 2, 112045434: 2, 111150658: 2, 110631955: 2, 111857342: 2, 111841723: 2, 110900723: 2, 112215667: 2, 109340724: 2, 110689679: 2, 108525788: 2, 107059069: 2, 110262256: 2, 111657384: 2, 111921737: 2, 111142184: 2, 112050112: 2, 112459347: 2, 200151702: 2, 112225055: 2, 108166735: 2, 200163324: 2, 106440310: 2, 109017895: 2, 113237721: 2, 111610436: 2, 200142768: 2, 200319558: 2, 200319717: 2, 112142591: 2, 107851075: 2, 111357648: 2, 200074903: 2, 200307237: 2, 106529776: 2, 200154262: 2, 110985244: 2, 113187400: 2, 200315966: 2, 200542963: 2, 200294199: 2, 110591893: 2, 110875851: 2, 106922041: 2, 200469947: 2, 200060911: 2, 200840998: 2, 200249961: 2, 109932626: 2, 200267777: 2, 106561728: 1, 106751248: 1, 105941782: 1, 107969579: 1, 108323817: 1, 109101477: 1, 108048090: 1, 107377680: 1, 106967283: 1, 110619029: 1, 109692317: 1, 108085357: 1, 112042073: 1, 109393254: 1, 111825461: 1, 108943993: 1, 200268309: 1}"
Hold Me aka The Move,107580693.0,Sport,105907984.0,5.13a,0.0,1.0,0.3,3.0,"Not a classic but but worth doing if... Well, say you have already done everything else at the cliff but you find your self there and yer looking for a hard time. The flow of the route was surprisingly cool once I figured it out. A few of the holds are a bit uncomfortable but if you dig hard crimping you will like it.   In the book it mentions hard clips, the only tough clip would be the 3rd clip but once the draws are in place it wasn't too bad.     The 1st section is tricky and a bit hard, say V4, then you get a good rest (almost no hands). I climbed up and clipped bolt #3 then went back to rest. From here you will encounter hard crimping leading to an undeniable crux move (hence the name). I solved it with a dyno off of a razor crimp. That part is about about V7 in my opinion. It's easy to clip the 4th bolt here and figure your way over the lip to the slab above (the lip encounter could use a little scrubbing). Climb the slab past a pin and a bolt to end at the shared anchor with Lies and Propaganda.    This route was misnamed The Move in the latest guidebook.    Ps. the rock is funky, a little sharp but it was all solid... over and out.","{105906559: 1, 106108710: 0, 200324531: 0}"
Lies and Propaganda,105923839.0,Sport,105907984.0,5.9,55.0,1.0,2.6,307.0,"Lies and Propaganda is deservedly one of the most popular 5.9s at Rumney.  In late 2005, a large flake fell off the bottom of the route that upped the difficulty level a bit.  The initial moves to the second bolt are steep and pumpy, with the crux coming right after the second bolt.  The climbing eases a bit in the middle, and then finishes through a fun, juggy overhang.  After pulling through the overhang, work around to the right and climb the final short slab to the anchors.  Fun climb, and worth the wait.","{105795015: 4, 12345: 4, 105839151: 4, 106762873: 4, 106096336: 4, 106600250: 4, 107842362: 4, 109218536: 4, 108110667: 4, 111546553: 4, 112322643: 4, 112174305: 4, 112210382: 4, 200087637: 4, 111779719: 4, 200064982: 4, 200107036: 4, 200078397: 4, 200152635: 4, 110262051: 4, 200462592: 4, 200946477: 4, 106726952: 3, 105963968: 3, 106408472: 3, 107635859: 3, 10186: 3, 10610: 3, 105906559: 3, 107434457: 3, 107699201: 3, 107682885: 3, 107060717: 3, 105961696: 3, 106957265: 3, 105997912: 3, 106686976: 3, 106417094: 3, 105887867: 3, 106028942: 3, 106117267: 3, 106876126: 3, 107655644: 3, 106868421: 3, 106306579: 3, 106103271: 3, 106378848: 3, 106075659: 3, 106358784: 3, 105832216: 3, 106358364: 3, 106347294: 3, 106434727: 3, 106386213: 3, 106150571: 3, 106113062: 3, 106031999: 3, 106486112: 3, 106134707: 3, 105889415: 3, 106844475: 3, 106205646: 3, 106897206: 3, 106971875: 3, 107126711: 3, 106860568: 3, 107347295: 3, 106928886: 3, 106397425: 3, 108139891: 3, 107085584: 3, 108193208: 3, 108217726: 3, 107563431: 3, 108244717: 3, 107870857: 3, 108087249: 3, 107630444: 3, 108362846: 3, 108222002: 3, 106360234: 3, 105913936: 3, 108265416: 3, 106588555: 3, 107921774: 3, 108711756: 3, 108323817: 3, 107711888: 3, 108157281: 3, 108202763: 3, 109076559: 3, 107604888: 3, 107169450: 3, 107698881: 3, 109337092: 3, 106538248: 3, 106586268: 3, 108652563: 3, 109073630: 3, 107620610: 3, 108245758: 3, 109648338: 3, 110416235: 3, 107739229: 3, 109856891: 3, 109856888: 3, 107477790: 3, 106662131: 3, 109268194: 3, 110457315: 3, 110863417: 3, 108276722: 3, 110763740: 3, 107852661: 3, 111066391: 3, 110365118: 3, 111414778: 3, 110315255: 3, 111169936: 3, 111700905: 3, 107412430: 3, 110259196: 3, 110751062: 3, 112010408: 3, 107745631: 3, 111968804: 3, 111167972: 3, 109383300: 3, 112045434: 3, 112166087: 3, 109483250: 3, 106990659: 3, 110631955: 3, 200056643: 3, 110689679: 3, 110356941: 3, 108525788: 3, 108290010: 3, 200133279: 3, 109371843: 3, 200142768: 3, 111866796: 3, 112365589: 3, 109585594: 3, 200151702: 3, 110762698: 3, 110735872: 3, 106679659: 3, 110942549: 3, 108166735: 3, 108257055: 3, 106440310: 3, 109017895: 3, 111871900: 3, 200101052: 3, 110274904: 3, 109526908: 3, 111357648: 3, 200422992: 3, 106529776: 3, 107507531: 3, 110452119: 3, 111692889: 3, 200248995: 3, 112042073: 3, 110712867: 3, 200294199: 3, 200434459: 3, 106922041: 3, 112166651: 3, 112207022: 3, 200094136: 3, 200602398: 3, 200365518: 3, 200840998: 3, 200267777: 3, 200561363: 3, 109932626: 3, 200337611: 3, 200825839: 3, 200711420: 3, 200469646: 3, 200253316: 3, 200370951: 3, 200589074: 3, 106702886: 2, 105941791: 2, 105927660: 2, 105943577: 2, 105829522: 2, 105969895: 2, 107768862: 2, 107492957: 2, 105898385: 2, 107579039: 2, 106230078: 2, 106125724: 2, 107660333: 2, 106767622: 2, 106423391: 2, 105890157: 2, 106764476: 2, 106430658: 2, 106590583: 2, 106646308: 2, 107336862: 2, 108050314: 2, 107969579: 2, 107839581: 2, 106054402: 2, 108099571: 2, 108062894: 2, 106957540: 2, 108301940: 2, 109101477: 2, 109090119: 2, 107763339: 2, 107377680: 2, 108436633: 2, 108200547: 2, 108252197: 2, 107629960: 2, 110211008: 2, 109692317: 2, 105859360: 2, 107009084: 2, 108100269: 2, 106108710: 2, 109269951: 2, 107917066: 2, 106014521: 2, 108367353: 2, 111650615: 2, 106561728: 2, 111181604: 2, 110580188: 2, 107929356: 2, 110841071: 2, 111682044: 2, 111844655: 2, 111841723: 2, 111970633: 2, 111142184: 2, 111081279: 2, 111824829: 2, 107032446: 2, 111150658: 2, 107346586: 2, 111710111: 2, 112411512: 2, 110900723: 2, 109230273: 2, 109638995: 2, 112312149: 2, 108121411: 2, 107327535: 2, 112255797: 2, 107059069: 2, 112810997: 2, 111921737: 2, 112050112: 2, 112038160: 2, 108181716: 2, 200064120: 2, 111777299: 2, 110262256: 2, 113237721: 2, 112797688: 2, 200259024: 2, 110165451: 2, 200159460: 2, 109467833: 2, 200064270: 2, 200268309: 2, 107851075: 2, 110494556: 2, 110454201: 2, 111626403: 2, 110807699: 2, 200394465: 2, 200296165: 2, 112340080: 2, 110985244: 2, 200074903: 2, 113187400: 2, 107116940: 2, 200485328: 2, 109414386: 2, 7073220: 2, 110591893: 2, 110875851: 2, 111825461: 2, 200314873: 2, 200227731: 2, 108106981: 2, 106751248: 1, 105885105: 1, 108145511: 1, 107555169: 1, 107742566: 1, 107561935: 1, 110705741: 1, 108085357: 1, 108364795: 1, 200183282: 1, 106967283: 0}"

Just did it today and though it was a bit wet it was sharp enough to keep me on. Overall i thought it was a nice addition but i did feel that it was a bit sketchy going to the chains. It looked like if you blew one of the last moves you could hit the ledge below (like on Bonehead to the left). Thats why I put PG13, post your opinions if you disagree.    Climb the mossy slab start as for beginners/ Bonehead Roof. Head straight up the face on sharp holds following stainless steel eyebolts. The crux happens low and is painful on the fingers but there are lots of foot options to make the holds work. At about the 4th bolt the climbing eases up and you will soon be on a large ledge. Head up and right through a notch clipping your last bolt and step awkwardly to the right to another nice ledge. I would have liked another bolt here. Make a couple moves to the quick clips and say hurray!","{106486112: 3, 111181604: 3, 107257835: 3, 108244717: 3, 112189841: 3, 109545197: 3, 108162192: 3, 107745631: 3, 107842362: 3, 108028939: 3, 110471998: 3, 108760211: 3, 110756813: 3, 106347294: 3, 107629960: 3, 200372430: 3, 109406130: 3, 106103271: 3, 108032974: 3, 111063806: 2, 110315426: 2, 110816178: 2, 109230273: 2, 110900723: 2, 109340724: 2, 107059069: 2, 108301940: 2, 107346586: 2, 106957265: 2, 107116940: 2, 111357648: 2, 200154262: 2, 108981414: 2, 107085584: 2, 107183979: 2, 110762698: 2, 200141465: 2, 107727480: 2, 200264338: 2, 110262256: 2, 200006438: 2, 105832216: 2, 110942549: 2, 108245758: 2, 106191055: 2, 106876126: 2, 106134707: 2, 105913936: 2, 106125724: 2, 105890157: 2, 107134664: 2, 106306579: 2, 108222002: 2, 108106981: 2, 106588555: 2, 108087249: 2, 105859360: 2, 106971875: 2, 111900208: 2, 107942262: 2, 110259196: 2, 109711410: 2, 106928886: 2, 105906559: 2, 105943577: 2, 111091265: 2, 112340080: 1, 106646308: 1, 106702886: 1, 200267777: 1, 112276558: 1, 106719610: 1, 108276722: 1, 112010408: 1, 107851075: 1, 106397425: 1, 107739229: 1, 200064120: 1, 107602549: 1, 107969579: 1, 107126711: 1, 111776352: 1, 110062671: 1, 111779719: 1, 200259729: 0}"

A nice long single pitch of mostly juggy but interesting steep climbing. Yet another quality 5.10 at Rumney.  The original trad line started up near Rhino Buckets and followed the corner pretty much to the top of the cliff. The line was recently retro-bolted and follows a slightly different line beginning down left to avoid some wet spots and follow the best rock. Just look for the line of bolts to the left of Rhino-buckets and climb away. Beta for the top - Once you clip the last bolt, traverse left on the horizontal, then layback the nice arete until you can reach the incut jugs back right - more fun and avoids the thin, dirtier moves you run into going strait up from the ledge on the right.  It has always been a great route... now the masses will know it too...  This is one of my favorite routes at the meadows.","{106423391: 4, 106486112: 4, 108436633: 4, 110456388: 4, 111181604: 4, 106662131: 4, 108032974: 4, 108981462: 4, 108640722: 4, 110580188: 4, 200111641: 4, 111825461: 4, 111779719: 4, 200064982: 4, 107183979: 4, 112247638: 4, 110985244: 4, 200179659: 4, 200129067: 4, 200294199: 4, 110262051: 4, 110452119: 4, 200145579: 4, 110756813: 4, 107533223: 4, 200267777: 4, 107727480: 4, 200462073: 4, 200040901: 4, 105906559: 3, 107126711: 3, 105885115: 3, 106397425: 3, 106957265: 3, 108202763: 3, 107621295: 3, 10610: 3, 108244717: 3, 108222002: 3, 108894743: 3, 108245758: 3, 105913936: 3, 106108710: 3, 105943577: 3, 105859360: 3, 107969579: 3, 107492957: 3, 109269951: 3, 107621814: 3, 107851075: 3, 110317485: 3, 108276722: 3, 109959108: 3, 111066391: 3, 109645277: 3, 111650615: 3, 110454932: 3, 106889145: 3, 111900208: 3, 108652563: 3, 108832516: 3, 110841071: 3, 108760211: 3, 107852661: 3, 108742211: 3, 107516695: 3, 110259196: 3, 107602549: 3, 107169450: 3, 112010408: 3, 111091265: 3, 110354839: 3, 108473722: 3, 108323817: 3, 112180124: 3, 107790662: 3, 112213686: 3, 106536923: 3, 107346586: 3, 108802410: 3, 200064521: 3, 106306579: 3, 109393254: 3, 110471998: 3, 112312149: 3, 107745631: 3, 200078442: 3, 200052634: 3, 112810997: 3, 200114064: 3, 110262256: 3, 200142768: 3, 112050112: 3, 112189841: 3, 110172496: 3, 108181716: 3, 112038160: 3, 112042073: 3, 200038144: 3, 112797688: 3, 111657384: 3, 110762698: 3, 111796230: 3, 200227731: 3, 106647777: 3, 200259729: 3, 109884427: 3, 109467833: 3, 200078875: 3, 108943993: 3, 200101052: 3, 200253783: 3, 108301940: 3, 200150489: 3, 108981414: 3, 109406130: 3, 112142591: 3, 112166651: 3, 200296165: 3, 108200547: 3, 200289394: 3, 109648338: 3, 111626403: 3, 200074903: 3, 108028939: 3, 200437181: 3, 110494556: 3, 200374248: 3, 200107036: 3, 200185377: 3, 200238291: 3, 109414386: 3, 200381053: 3, 200248105: 3, 200536699: 3, 110591893: 3, 106538248: 3, 112207022: 3, 200595483: 3, 106928959: 3, 107108243: 3, 113460078: 3, 105832216: 3, 110739544: 3, 200711420: 3, 7128541: 3, 111650569: 3, 200040702: 3, 109932626: 3, 111844655: 3, 200183282: 3, 200211276: 3, 111777299: 3, 110791169: 3, 200591925: 3, 106590583: 3, 108106981: 3, 200825839: 3, 200395157: 3, 106189019: 3, 105898385: 3, 200183967: 3, 108478107: 3, 200954771: 3, 200160054: 3, 106876126: 2, 108157281: 2, 105890157: 2, 106449525: 2, 106561728: 2, 106868421: 2, 107739229: 2, 109711410: 2, 110365118: 2, 109371843: 2, 110396163: 2, 109328345: 2, 109102869: 2, 107412430: 2, 111841723: 2, 112077859: 2, 106741264: 2, 110294685: 2, 109483250: 2, 106280222: 2, 112322643: 2, 112169001: 2, 110293668: 2, 107327535: 2, 113164188: 2, 112365589: 2, 111277314: 2, 200155809: 2, 111142184: 2, 106967283: 2, 111692889: 2, 200159460: 2, 107085584: 2, 110062671: 2, 109788726: 2, 200268309: 2, 200154262: 2, 110689679: 2, 106146571: 2, 106646308: 2, 106054402: 2, 112028027: 2}"

Another route to test your beginnerish skills on without having to suffer any hiking.    Climb the beginning slab directly or stem in the corner to the right. Repeat this all the way to the top pretty much. You either climb the face or stem the corner past bolts and pins to the quick clips up and to the right.    A good rest in the corner at the halfway mark can suck in a nervous newbie and they might have a hard time stepping back out on to the route.","{106408932: 4, 109444640: 4, 112100950: 4, 200136973: 4, 200151702: 4, 200064982: 4, 200450654: 4, 200542963: 4, 107253738: 3, 106513867: 3, 106469016: 3, 106590583: 3, 107702396: 3, 108273975: 3, 106967283: 3, 110433236: 3, 107793593: 3, 110363121: 3, 110259196: 3, 110356941: 3, 109383300: 3, 112180124: 3, 111900976: 3, 200056643: 3, 112210382: 3, 200087637: 3, 106679659: 3, 112834425: 3, 200041302: 3, 110341322: 3, 200324531: 3, 109526908: 3, 111626403: 3, 111119242: 3, 200337035: 3, 200561363: 3, 200873496: 3, 200704601: 3, 107228100: 2, 107635859: 2, 106957265: 2, 105906559: 2, 107852661: 2, 106876126: 2, 106306579: 2, 106358364: 2, 106380993: 2, 106113062: 2, 106386213: 2, 106555971: 2, 106674236: 2, 106764476: 2, 106784159: 2, 106757064: 2, 106971875: 2, 105890157: 2, 106928886: 2, 107266915: 2, 106868421: 2, 108011499: 2, 105835839: 2, 107363666: 2, 108157281: 2, 106397425: 2, 105913936: 2, 110522591: 2, 107698881: 2, 109337092: 2, 109073630: 2, 108048090: 2, 109523045: 2, 109090119: 2, 107373999: 2, 108245758: 2, 106788981: 2, 110724330: 2, 107385412: 2, 110735872: 2, 110619733: 2, 108100269: 2, 109324282: 2, 110964025: 2, 108367353: 2, 110638625: 2, 108200547: 2, 110705741: 2, 106917454: 2, 110706284: 2, 111414778: 2, 111784826: 2, 108188495: 2, 111779719: 2, 110580188: 2, 111169936: 2, 111520764: 2, 111181604: 2, 111004308: 2, 111970633: 2, 12023: 2, 111298824: 2, 111737844: 2, 107346586: 2, 110631955: 2, 112411512: 2, 110762698: 2, 108827034: 2, 112895635: 2, 112247638: 2, 112115244: 2, 112312149: 2, 200054289: 2, 108406663: 2, 108290010: 2, 109585594: 2, 109692317: 2, 200163324: 2, 200312793: 2, 200078875: 2, 200101052: 2, 109169640: 2, 200074903: 2, 200129067: 2, 200160054: 2, 200315966: 2, 200297969: 2, 200342646: 2, 112207022: 2, 200222515: 2, 110454201: 2, 200416944: 2, 200584602: 2, 200469646: 2, 106567319: 1, 106417094: 1, 106134707: 1, 106751248: 1, 107126711: 1, 108217726: 1, 108244717: 1, 107064260: 1, 108222002: 1, 107604888: 1, 107682885: 1, 107657353: 1, 106653468: 1, 105885115: 1, 107377680: 1, 108736383: 1, 112164950: 1, 111167972: 1, 111841723: 1, 112215667: 1, 111610436: 1, 111921737: 1, 200133279: 1, 111825461: 1, 106440310: 1, 200265615: 1, 200000618: 1, 200302765: 1, 110712867: 1, 200485328: 1, 111650569: 1, 200469947: 1, 200840998: 1, 200168968: 1, 110591893: 1, 107711888: 0}"
Rhino Bucket,105961410.0,Sport,105907984.0,5.10a,0.0,1.0,2.4,169.0,"For me, this climb was one I did once and tried to forget. The climb is awkward in the way it climbs up the sequence of ledges and you are always clipping a bolt strangely.     Clipping the anchors is by far the crux of this climb and shouldn't be attempted by a leader who isn't comfortable at the grade.     (*Added for clarification*- I am simply stating that the final holds are pumpy and awkward to reach. As a fall from the anchors while pulling up slack would be very painful, I suggest someone who's limit is 5.10 try this climb on TR to find the holds and become comfortable with them before s/he tries to lead this one.)    By the way, RhinoBUCKETS is a big of a misnomer. The holds on this route aren't all buckets, some of them can be difficult to hold on to for the grade, especially at the anchor. Although, there is a Rhino-shaped hold on the climb. It is a huge jug that resembles a rhino's horn if looked at the right way.(The previous sentence was added Post-Comment, thank you Chris Duca)","{106411080: 4, 107742566: 4, 110456388: 4, 110259196: 4, 110813639: 4, 107876007: 4, 200485328: 4, 200542963: 4, 110262051: 4, 110452119: 4, 107272204: 3, 105943577: 3, 105906559: 3, 106075659: 3, 106306579: 3, 106103271: 3, 106378848: 3, 106347294: 3, 106707814: 3, 106408472: 3, 106358364: 3, 106423391: 3, 106698297: 3, 106932322: 3, 108145511: 3, 108167549: 3, 108193208: 3, 106719610: 3, 107630444: 3, 108362846: 3, 106538248: 3, 106616366: 3, 107629960: 3, 109101477: 3, 106647777: 3, 107768989: 3, 107768945: 3, 108245758: 3, 105859360: 3, 108148725: 3, 109711410: 3, 109269951: 3, 108110667: 3, 107602549: 3, 110619029: 3, 107126711: 3, 111181604: 3, 110433236: 3, 110396163: 3, 111546553: 3, 107169450: 3, 108032974: 3, 106536923: 3, 109483250: 3, 107745631: 3, 110356941: 3, 112365589: 3, 110762698: 3, 107346586: 3, 200259729: 3, 111779719: 3, 109388986: 3, 107507531: 3, 200063563: 3, 200374248: 3, 200574265: 3, 200145579: 3, 200416944: 3, 200602398: 3, 105832216: 3, 107727480: 3, 200040702: 3, 108106981: 3, 200294199: 3, 106189019: 3, 200325236: 3, 105898385: 3, 106702886: 2, 106030548: 2, 106486112: 2, 105887867: 2, 106971875: 2, 106117267: 2, 106096336: 2, 106113062: 2, 106031999: 2, 106386213: 2, 105889415: 2, 105890157: 2, 107347295: 2, 106646308: 2, 106561728: 2, 107085584: 2, 107257835: 2, 107851075: 2, 108087249: 2, 106588555: 2, 105913936: 2, 106876126: 2, 108157281: 2, 106449525: 2, 105885115: 2, 108202763: 2, 108244717: 2, 106535286: 2, 107739229: 2, 107492957: 2, 110365118: 2, 106108710: 2, 108276722: 2, 111066391: 2, 107723439: 2, 106897206: 2, 107929356: 2, 108742211: 2, 108473722: 2, 110471998: 2, 106990659: 2, 108222002: 2, 111841723: 2, 110816178: 2, 108290010: 2, 111142184: 2, 106397425: 2, 110580188: 2, 108181716: 2, 109017895: 2, 200101052: 2, 111657384: 2, 200296165: 2, 109467833: 2, 111649446: 2, 200078875: 2, 109788726: 2, 109406130: 2, 112142591: 2, 109648338: 2, 200074903: 2, 109414386: 2, 107852661: 2, 106054402: 2, 200124802: 2, 106967283: 2, 200060911: 2, 112276558: 2, 200408941: 2, 112028027: 2, 111443138: 2, 111844655: 2, 200129067: 2, 200462073: 2, 200040901: 2, 106928886: 1, 105839151: 1, 106957265: 1, 107655644: 1, 106151063: 1, 106125724: 1, 106417094: 1, 107969579: 1, 109393254: 1, 109102869: 1, 111900208: 1, 110262256: 1, 111810451: 1, 110459495: 1, 109884427: 1, 107116940: 1, 112042073: 1}"

Starting with low-angle climbing typical of the easier Meadows climbs, you overcome a bulge at no harder than 5.10 gaining a ledge. Rest up then embark upon the cruxy second half of the route taking the path of least resistance up the slightly overhanging orangeish rock. From the rest ledge, move up and right to a bolt a super crimpy crux will test your fingers as you start, but the true crux for most lies at the end. After 5.11ish climbing past crimps and jugs, you clip the last bolt and traverse right. A few crimpy, pumpy holds guard a hidden jug which marks the end of your struggle and the beginning of your celebration. You have climbed one of THE classic 5.12s at Rumney.     This route was originally done with only 2 bolts, when the guide book was published it had 9 and now there are eleven.

You can avoid the direct roof move by going around to the right at 5.8...,"{109444640: 4, 107579237: 3, 106358364: 3, 106928959: 3, 107842362: 3, 109444514: 3, 109454067: 3, 109648338: 3, 108257055: 3, 110211008: 3, 108736383: 3, 107745631: 3, 111755066: 3, 112038160: 3, 112210382: 3, 108525788: 3, 200096522: 3, 109324282: 3, 112045434: 3, 200041302: 3, 200064982: 3, 200312793: 3, 111136253: 3, 7123072: 3, 200271452: 3, 200145579: 3, 200498039: 3, 107635859: 2, 106917454: 2, 107032446: 2, 106397425: 2, 105906559: 2, 105943577: 2, 106125724: 2, 106134707: 2, 106113062: 2, 106590583: 2, 106103271: 2, 106347294: 2, 105889415: 2, 105963968: 2, 106430658: 2, 106469016: 2, 105890157: 2, 106860568: 2, 106764476: 2, 108093743: 2, 107723439: 2, 108145511: 2, 108193208: 2, 108217726: 2, 108273975: 2, 108222002: 2, 108188495: 2, 106876126: 2, 107852661: 2, 108477749: 2, 108652563: 2, 109337092: 2, 106586268: 2, 109340692: 2, 108245758: 2, 105913936: 2, 108200547: 2, 107739229: 2, 107723931: 2, 109692317: 2, 110724330: 2, 107385412: 2, 107942262: 2, 107074658: 2, 109268194: 2, 110365118: 2, 107287218: 2, 107000115: 2, 110582478: 2, 108290010: 2, 111980925: 2, 108032974: 2, 112050112: 2, 111968804: 2, 109026046: 2, 109383300: 2, 108436633: 2, 112322643: 2, 111857342: 2, 112134885: 2, 110762698: 2, 112312149: 2, 112174305: 2, 109280499: 2, 106788981: 2, 111280577: 2, 111167972: 2, 200040802: 2, 110580188: 2, 107346586: 2, 200150525: 2, 200151702: 2, 106679659: 2, 110942549: 2, 111969490: 2, 110454201: 2, 110270698: 2, 110989228: 2, 200105953: 2, 200283698: 2, 111779719: 2, 107921774: 2, 106554217: 2, 200280402: 2, 200078875: 2, 111573930: 2, 112166651: 2, 200101052: 2, 106484669: 2, 200281228: 2, 111626403: 2, 200281875: 2, 111650569: 2, 107691094: 2, 110942763: 2, 200228539: 2, 200160054: 2, 110923255: 2, 200248995: 2, 108100269: 2, 105832216: 2, 200430991: 2, 200416944: 2, 200462592: 2, 111844655: 2, 108943993: 2, 200370951: 2, 106762873: 1, 106306579: 1, 106751248: 1, 106205646: 1, 106417094: 1, 107126711: 1, 108244717: 1, 106360234: 1, 107492957: 1, 107373999: 1, 107377680: 1, 106967283: 1, 107477790: 1, 106662131: 1, 111181604: 1, 111914048: 1, 110900723: 1, 111414778: 1, 109410883: 1, 111657384: 1, 200123481: 1, 200105749: 1, 112365589: 1, 111825461: 1, 106793247: 1, 112259761: 1, 106868421: 1, 107085584: 1, 110181635: 1, 112172937: 1, 110712867: 1, 200124802: 1, 110591893: 1, 108073727: 0, 110356941: 0, 200064120: 0}"
Easy Terms,105923640.0,Sport,105907981.0,5.8,45.0,1.0,2.0,191.0,"Easy Terms is a fun, moderate climb.  Like many of the routes here, the first bolt is a little high, but easy to get to.  The route zig-zags back and forth across the face, making the next move not always obvious.  The crux is a relatively smooth stretch between the first and second bolts, with some additional strenuous moves below the third bolt.  Above the third bolt the climbing eases significantly to the anchors.","{112210382: 4, 106928959: 3, 10186: 3, 107651072: 3, 105899248: 3, 106306579: 3, 106358364: 3, 105913936: 3, 106698297: 3, 107253738: 3, 107844469: 3, 109444640: 3, 110387428: 3, 107842362: 3, 110638625: 3, 110705741: 3, 111169936: 3, 110259196: 3, 111755066: 3, 110155662: 3, 110828030: 3, 112115244: 3, 200151702: 3, 112428357: 3, 106679659: 3, 200105953: 3, 200154540: 3, 107691094: 3, 200342646: 3, 200498039: 3, 200054270: 3, 106726952: 2, 105906559: 2, 106928886: 2, 106915263: 2, 105961696: 2, 105839151: 2, 105997912: 2, 105887867: 2, 106762873: 2, 106117267: 2, 107492957: 2, 106347294: 2, 106113062: 2, 106469016: 2, 106555971: 2, 106590583: 2, 106103271: 2, 105889415: 2, 106430658: 2, 105890157: 2, 106486112: 2, 106853290: 2, 106971875: 2, 107126711: 2, 107347295: 2, 106397425: 2, 108193208: 2, 108217726: 2, 107291614: 2, 108244717: 2, 108137876: 2, 106588555: 2, 108222002: 2, 108188495: 2, 108933008: 2, 106876126: 2, 107540375: 2, 108157281: 2, 108652563: 2, 106586268: 2, 107373999: 2, 108245758: 2, 109648338: 2, 107377680: 2, 106967283: 2, 107739229: 2, 107852661: 2, 106788981: 2, 107473980: 2, 107074658: 2, 109268194: 2, 108100269: 2, 109692317: 2, 106662131: 2, 110547878: 2, 108367353: 2, 108346584: 2, 108290010: 2, 111741538: 2, 110365118: 2, 111163750: 2, 111980925: 2, 110751062: 2, 111181604: 2, 109052547: 2, 111081279: 2, 106793247: 2, 106917454: 2, 112164950: 2, 111796230: 2, 110631955: 2, 111857342: 2, 112134885: 2, 110762698: 2, 111900976: 2, 112463509: 2, 112312149: 2, 200074903: 2, 200078875: 2, 107327535: 2, 106421544: 2, 108525788: 2, 107059069: 2, 111280577: 2, 111921737: 2, 109324282: 2, 110262256: 2, 107346586: 2, 111825461: 2, 110942549: 2, 110989228: 2, 109017895: 2, 200167620: 2, 111779719: 2, 109932626: 2, 200312793: 2, 111004308: 2, 200351074: 2, 200101052: 2, 200064270: 2, 200142768: 2, 110452119: 2, 112166651: 2, 200338734: 2, 200485328: 2, 110689679: 2, 111650569: 2, 110985244: 2, 200228539: 2, 200160054: 2, 112375922: 2, 200264338: 2, 111626403: 2, 200248995: 2, 110915247: 2, 200314873: 2, 105832216: 2, 200063563: 2, 200416944: 2, 200129067: 2, 200840998: 2, 200194815: 2, 200946477: 2, 200370951: 2, 107635859: 1, 105943577: 1, 105938601: 1, 106417094: 1, 106751248: 1, 106205646: 1, 108195048: 1, 108323817: 1, 108595560: 1, 109014097: 1, 107169450: 1, 108200547: 1, 110356941: 1, 111142184: 1, 111921579: 1, 111824829: 1, 111546553: 1, 112213686: 1, 112050112: 1, 111414778: 1, 112922257: 1, 107745631: 1, 112365589: 1, 110454201: 1, 106868421: 1, 107085584: 1, 110181635: 1, 112172937: 1, 107768989: 1, 110942763: 1, 110923255: 1, 200294199: 1, 200462592: 1, 110591893: 1, 107555169: 0, 110900723: 0}"

The guide book says that everything below the anchors is 5.6, with the last 5.7 mantle above the anchors.","{109444640: 4, 112180124: 4, 111684926: 4, 105899248: 3, 106358364: 3, 106600250: 3, 106469016: 3, 108195048: 3, 107051650: 3, 106586268: 3, 107763339: 3, 109897147: 3, 111921579: 3, 111854408: 3, 111181604: 3, 110155662: 3, 111900976: 3, 112922257: 3, 112064732: 3, 200038840: 3, 112210382: 3, 200081629: 3, 200154540: 3, 200064982: 3, 200324531: 3, 111136253: 3, 200129067: 3, 112375922: 3, 200248995: 3, 200271452: 3, 200342646: 3, 111849990: 3, 200145579: 3, 200222515: 3, 200409226: 3, 200704601: 3, 200498039: 3, 106764476: 2, 106726952: 2, 10186: 2, 105906559: 2, 106134707: 2, 105801390: 2, 105961696: 2, 105839151: 2, 106486112: 2, 107492957: 2, 107878732: 2, 106306579: 2, 106103271: 2, 106399334: 2, 106075659: 2, 106380993: 2, 106426493: 2, 106113062: 2, 106555971: 2, 106698297: 2, 106590583: 2, 106767622: 2, 105889415: 2, 105963968: 2, 106822110: 2, 105890157: 2, 106860568: 2, 106853290: 2, 107347295: 2, 106397425: 2, 108093743: 2, 108145511: 2, 106917454: 2, 108193208: 2, 108217726: 2, 107385412: 2, 108273975: 2, 107291614: 2, 107783414: 2, 108222002: 2, 106360234: 2, 108188495: 2, 105913936: 2, 106876126: 2, 109101477: 2, 108202763: 2, 108375710: 2, 107782738: 2, 106653468: 2, 109006073: 2, 109340692: 2, 108245758: 2, 107377680: 2, 110387428: 2, 108048090: 2, 110452119: 2, 106967283: 2, 108257055: 2, 107723931: 2, 106788981: 2, 109692317: 2, 110724330: 2, 110044455: 2, 108736383: 2, 110522591: 2, 107942262: 2, 106423391: 2, 110638625: 2, 107287218: 2, 108652563: 2, 108367353: 2, 110582478: 2, 111917126: 2, 108290010: 2, 111741538: 2, 111980925: 2, 110751062: 2, 111968804: 2, 109052547: 2, 109383300: 2, 111546553: 2, 107373999: 2, 111796230: 2, 110631955: 2, 112322643: 2, 108162192: 2, 111277314: 2, 111811598: 2, 112115244: 2, 106679659: 2, 112463509: 2, 111821697: 2, 112312149: 2, 200074903: 2, 200078875: 2, 107327535: 2, 106421544: 2, 108525788: 2, 200096522: 2, 111280577: 2, 111921737: 2, 107897881: 2, 112365589: 2, 110580188: 2, 107346586: 2, 111204267: 2, 112045434: 2, 106793247: 2, 110942549: 2, 200041302: 2, 200064120: 2, 110454201: 2, 111167972: 2, 109017895: 2, 200167620: 2, 111779719: 2, 200265615: 2, 109451199: 2, 107921774: 2, 106816129: 2, 108235470: 2, 106554217: 2, 200280402: 2, 200312793: 2, 200154910: 2, 111004308: 2, 111573930: 2, 107085584: 2, 200351074: 2, 200101052: 2, 112166651: 2, 106484669: 2, 200281228: 2, 111626403: 2, 110315255: 2, 200485328: 2, 108552179: 2, 110762698: 2, 200078397: 2, 200228539: 2, 112038160: 2, 200294199: 2, 107739229: 2, 200593892: 2, 110915247: 2, 108100269: 2, 105832216: 2, 200160054: 2, 200584602: 2, 200416944: 2, 111844655: 2, 106589007: 2, 112207022: 2, 200150170: 2, 200946477: 2, 108943993: 2, 107253738: 2, 107336862: 1, 105943577: 1, 106125724: 1, 106751248: 1, 106430658: 1, 106971875: 1, 107126711: 1, 106417094: 1, 106719610: 1, 108087249: 1, 108244717: 1, 107870857: 1, 107852661: 1, 107742566: 1, 108200086: 1, 109090889: 1, 109014097: 1, 107222279: 1, 107169450: 1, 107852925: 1, 107477790: 1, 106662131: 1, 111050831: 1, 111414778: 1, 111081279: 1, 111810451: 1, 111914048: 1, 112164950: 1, 112050112: 1, 107745631: 1, 111610436: 1, 109324282: 1, 200105749: 1, 110262256: 1, 200040802: 1, 108200547: 1, 106868421: 1, 111825461: 1, 200264338: 1, 110181635: 1, 111650569: 1, 200541836: 1, 200574265: 1, 200469947: 1, 200168968: 1, 110591893: 1, 200121608: 1}"

However, once you are off the ground this climb becomes quiet fun and moves very well over great Rumney schist. This climb finishes on some very fun moves on underclings while traversing across a bulge to the anchors.","{106740419: 4, 106764476: 3, 107130713: 3, 106358364: 3, 105801390: 3, 106113062: 3, 107842362: 3, 108416778: 3, 108375710: 3, 109444640: 3, 109006073: 3, 110863417: 3, 106662131: 3, 106423391: 3, 111741538: 3, 108367353: 3, 111546553: 3, 111796230: 3, 107327535: 3, 108525788: 3, 111825461: 3, 200064982: 3, 110452119: 3, 7123072: 3, 200228539: 3, 112401943: 3, 200946477: 3, 107540375: 2, 106726952: 2, 107635859: 2, 105961696: 2, 105839151: 2, 107878732: 2, 106103271: 2, 106378848: 2, 106411080: 2, 106380993: 2, 106426493: 2, 105932490: 2, 106469016: 2, 105889415: 2, 106430658: 2, 105890157: 2, 106381547: 2, 106971875: 2, 107347295: 2, 106646308: 2, 106397425: 2, 108139891: 2, 107257835: 2, 107870857: 2, 107783414: 2, 108188495: 2, 105913936: 2, 106449525: 2, 106876126: 2, 107852661: 2, 107169450: 2, 108477749: 2, 109337092: 2, 109340692: 2, 108245758: 2, 106586268: 2, 107377680: 2, 108200547: 2, 108436633: 2, 105859360: 2, 110582478: 2, 107929356: 2, 107298231: 2, 110923255: 2, 111844655: 2, 112050112: 2, 111968804: 2, 109383300: 2, 106917454: 2, 107373999: 2, 112038160: 2, 107090485: 2, 111857342: 2, 111277314: 2, 112463509: 2, 200096522: 2, 110762698: 2, 110454201: 2, 109585594: 2, 107921774: 2, 200101052: 2, 112166651: 2, 200064270: 2, 200437181: 2, 200338734: 2, 200078447: 2, 105832216: 2, 200469253: 2, 200462592: 2, 200604841: 2, 200314873: 2, 200337611: 2, 200498039: 2, 112207022: 2, 200160054: 2, 107336862: 1, 105943577: 1, 105906559: 1, 106576182: 1, 106486112: 1, 106134707: 1, 106075659: 1, 106054402: 1, 105885115: 1, 106306579: 1, 106150571: 1, 106125724: 1, 106347294: 1, 106561728: 1, 106751248: 1, 107085584: 1, 106360234: 1, 107602549: 1, 107477790: 1, 107739229: 1, 108257055: 1, 107851075: 1, 106967283: 1, 111181604: 1, 111081279: 1, 111414778: 1, 107745631: 1, 112365589: 1, 107346586: 1, 112259761: 1, 106868421: 1, 110181635: 1, 110712867: 1, 110942763: 1, 112091216: 1, 200152635: 1, 111167972: 1, 200825839: 1, 108981414: 1, 110591893: 1, 107126711: 1, 111888991: 0, 110985244: 0}"

No Money Down is a Gunks like climb that starts in a corner on the left end of The Meadows and goes over a beautiful roof (this was the farthest route left when the last guide was published).... Starting up the corner you climb about 35 feet up on awkward but moderate horizontal edges.... Rest briefly and head up to the roof toward a weird horn and a hueco.... Pull over the roof and, just when you think it's over, you hit the crux.... All the holds seem to be at odd angles, your feet leave something to be desired, and it can be reachy for smaller climbers...but don't despair, one or two moves to the left will deliver the chains....    This was a mostly trad route with one bolt at the crux, but it got bolted recently... So now it is for anyone and everyone to try....","{106358784: 4, 106113062: 4, 106740608: 4, 109218536: 4, 106045498: 4, 107745631: 4, 110259196: 4, 108436633: 4, 112386569: 4, 111810534: 4, 200271452: 4, 200462073: 4, 200370327: 4, 106928886: 3, 106397425: 3, 107540375: 3, 106726952: 3, 107620610: 3, 106876126: 3, 105906559: 3, 105832216: 3, 105886022: 3, 106075659: 3, 106103271: 3, 106378848: 3, 106306579: 3, 106421243: 3, 105913936: 3, 106340439: 3, 106074233: 3, 106150571: 3, 106031999: 3, 106698297: 3, 106358364: 3, 106561728: 3, 106740419: 3, 105890157: 3, 106486112: 3, 106381547: 3, 106971875: 3, 106702886: 3, 106751248: 3, 108096611: 3, 107723439: 3, 108167549: 3, 108181716: 3, 107291614: 3, 107663290: 3, 106588555: 3, 108362846: 3, 108222002: 3, 107870857: 3, 106360234: 3, 108188495: 3, 107764394: 3, 107604975: 3, 109101477: 3, 107852661: 3, 108157281: 3, 107621814: 3, 106586268: 3, 108245758: 3, 106917454: 3, 106535286: 3, 108265416: 3, 109269951: 3, 110211008: 3, 109692317: 3, 107287218: 3, 110365118: 3, 107917066: 3, 107698881: 3, 107412430: 3, 107000115: 3, 111066391: 3, 110728444: 3, 109264747: 3, 111181604: 3, 111783002: 3, 106889145: 3, 106662131: 3, 108652563: 3, 111700905: 3, 109340692: 3, 107298231: 3, 111909917: 3, 111682044: 3, 111163750: 3, 112010408: 3, 108032974: 3, 109648338: 3, 109467833: 3, 106957265: 3, 111824829: 3, 109026046: 3, 107602549: 3, 112037097: 3, 111468613: 3, 111796230: 3, 109483250: 3, 110900723: 3, 112332863: 3, 112230384: 3, 111278312: 3, 110293668: 3, 111039775: 3, 112210382: 3, 111280577: 3, 111169936: 3, 111277314: 3, 110172496: 3, 112425011: 3, 108693865: 3, 200054289: 3, 110270698: 3, 109414386: 3, 109585594: 3, 106922041: 3, 109017895: 3, 111928487: 3, 200057050: 3, 106210225: 3, 200064982: 3, 109142435: 3, 108235470: 3, 110262256: 3, 200159460: 3, 200154910: 3, 107680416: 3, 112166651: 3, 111502816: 3, 111626403: 3, 200129067: 3, 200437181: 3, 110942549: 3, 200281875: 3, 111649446: 3, 200107036: 3, 7073220: 3, 111031033: 3, 200393504: 3, 110712867: 3, 108552179: 3, 112091216: 3, 110923255: 3, 200381053: 3, 112038160: 3, 200294199: 3, 111849990: 3, 110262051: 3, 200124802: 3, 110915247: 3, 200145579: 3, 110756813: 3, 200078447: 3, 110762698: 3, 7050333: 3, 111844655: 3, 200604841: 3, 200060331: 3, 200469253: 3, 200840998: 3, 200825839: 3, 200856584: 3, 200430991: 3, 200798343: 3, 109683196: 3, 105943577: 2, 105839151: 2, 106271741: 2, 105885115: 2, 106411080: 2, 106134707: 2, 106426493: 2, 106347294: 2, 106710887: 2, 105886426: 2, 105963968: 2, 106430658: 2, 106646308: 2, 106762873: 2, 107969579: 2, 107839581: 2, 106719610: 2, 108073727: 2, 108244717: 2, 108062894: 2, 106449525: 2, 106423391: 2, 108148725: 2, 107178254: 2, 108202763: 2, 106538248: 2, 109472534: 2, 109111514: 2, 107377680: 2, 106108710: 2, 107477790: 2, 107739229: 2, 107492957: 2, 105859360: 2, 107851075: 2, 107942262: 2, 110375948: 2, 108276722: 2, 109328345: 2, 108832516: 2, 108290010: 2, 107929356: 2, 110841071: 2, 107801617: 2, 107009084: 2, 111968804: 2, 109383300: 2, 112128898: 2, 112322643: 2, 110816178: 2, 108121411: 2, 108200547: 2, 111841723: 2, 107327535: 2, 109324282: 2, 108364795: 2, 107346586: 2, 200067404: 2, 106868421: 2, 111692889: 2, 200296165: 2, 111344408: 2, 200078875: 2, 109369300: 2, 108301940: 2, 112207022: 2, 110689679: 2, 200074903: 2, 200374248: 2, 111546553: 2, 110942763: 2, 200063563: 2, 110985244: 2, 112042073: 2, 107085584: 2, 200060911: 2, 111142184: 2, 107711888: 2, 110739544: 2, 200833892: 2, 200395157: 2, 200145352: 2, 200711420: 2, 110591893: 2, 107126711: 2, 200057419: 2, 10610: 1, 105898385: 1, 106054402: 1, 106125724: 1, 108711756: 1, 107842362: 1, 111414778: 1, 107183979: 1, 200302765: 1, 106967283: 1, 107222279: 1, 7132986: 0}"

If you like sharp, powerful, bouldery climbing dig in...    Climb the moderate start up a juggy vertical face that is much like the start of No Money Down... The big difference between this climb and that one is that once you get to the roof this crux is about V5 rather than the V1 or V2 that gets you to the chains on No Money Down (5.10c)... A good jug before the roof lets you rest a little (though you might not need it) before pulling in to some powerful moves out a roof and a rounded bulge... The holds are sharp and keeping your feet on requires some core strength... There looks to be many options for a sequence through the crux... I've even heard that a knee bar is possible (but i havent found it), however you get it done, have fun with it...    I use an undercling left on the roof, then a pocket with a thumb catch right, to a pretty good but very sharp left hand hold and a big move with a right leg drop-knee to a crimp before getting my hands over the top via a couple smaller moves...

Before Smokestack climb the face right of a diagonal crack (long vintage soft angle pin) and stopper placements that splits the wall. Continue up ramp that terminates at cracks.    That ended our first day creating this route. It had too much rope drag! Came back and set up a rappel to bolt the bottom face. Now Sam's had a direct start to the horizontal crack and a pin was added near the top of the cliff. Bill and I returned and the crux went fine but I screwed up the sequence at the pin and fell before clipping it. Huge air drop. I had the bolt kit on me and placed a bolt below the last pin on the lead before I finished the climb. Retrospade has chalk on the same face holds as 'Sam Spade' does. They look like Siamese Twins. Maybe Sam Spade went into obscurity with it's gag, vintage pin relic. The pin was fine.    Today that's the only thing left on this route that's original are the bolts and pins because of Tom's declaration that 'Retrospade' is a separated from 'Sam Spade' climb from ours.

This section involves tiny crimps, sidepulls, underclings, and even slopers...even clipping the chains presents a challenge cause the hard climbing won't let up once it starts....","{106096336: 4, 107663772: 4, 107852661: 4, 107629487: 4, 108110667: 4, 107412430: 4, 111692304: 4, 107260705: 4, 106922041: 4, 109388986: 4, 200175729: 4, 200430991: 4, 200267777: 4, 106971875: 3, 106716166: 3, 106717690: 3, 105906559: 3, 105839151: 3, 105938601: 3, 106957118: 3, 105885115: 3, 106039986: 3, 105933166: 3, 105899248: 3, 106103271: 3, 105832216: 3, 106378848: 3, 106125724: 3, 106650513: 3, 106399472: 3, 106834913: 3, 106358784: 3, 105963968: 3, 107126711: 3, 107969579: 3, 108226496: 3, 108244717: 3, 107851075: 3, 107630444: 3, 108222002: 3, 106397425: 3, 106702886: 3, 107698881: 3, 107540375: 3, 105960152: 3, 109006073: 3, 108245758: 3, 108290010: 3, 106441684: 3, 106853290: 3, 107602549: 3, 106251687: 3, 106967283: 3, 106423391: 3, 110317485: 3, 106215535: 3, 111872948: 3, 105859360: 3, 112100767: 3, 107346586: 3, 109076559: 3, 111882861: 3, 111810451: 3, 111181604: 3, 108032974: 3, 111682044: 3, 108029322: 3, 111142184: 3, 107723439: 3, 112079214: 3, 109255473: 3, 108436633: 3, 105875389: 3, 112091216: 3, 200152657: 3, 109585594: 3, 108200547: 3, 110454327: 3, 109328345: 3, 111657384: 3, 107680416: 3, 110534118: 3, 111344408: 3, 200154262: 3, 106339890: 3, 200319558: 3, 109909065: 3, 106957265: 3, 112404909: 3, 110689679: 3, 112340080: 3, 109017895: 3, 110942763: 3, 200122418: 3, 112172937: 3, 200057419: 3, 200323065: 3, 107790662: 3, 110762698: 3, 200145579: 3, 111825461: 3, 113460078: 3, 110739544: 3, 200084683: 3, 200406385: 3, 200469253: 3, 106670299: 3, 112207022: 3, 200169513: 3, 107169450: 3, 200171228: 3, 200605163: 3, 200840998: 3, 106486112: 2, 106054402: 2, 107619140: 2, 106876126: 2, 10610: 2, 105898385: 2, 106134707: 2, 106031999: 2, 106151063: 2, 106145409: 2, 105890157: 2, 106864388: 2, 106646308: 2, 108145511: 2, 107085584: 2, 108181716: 2, 106588555: 2, 107628457: 2, 107394785: 2, 107492957: 2, 109101477: 2, 106913999: 2, 108894743: 2, 106108710: 2, 106538248: 2, 108301940: 2, 111902978: 2, 111909917: 2, 109102869: 2, 110224429: 2, 200051409: 2, 111278312: 2, 110942549: 2, 109884427: 2, 108943993: 2, 106210225: 2, 200319717: 2, 200296165: 2, 111781359: 2, 112354371: 2, 110985244: 2, 108827034: 2, 200159460: 2, 107891721: 2, 107108243: 2, 200954771: 2, 105943577: 1, 109333124: 1, 108276722: 1, 111841723: 1}"

The rock is interesting with quartz deposits making for some cool moves.  Climb the first moderate boulder problem off the ground to a nice rest before the crux bulge (its only 10 feet up but I never refuse a rest when offered one). Head up and left on jugs till they run out, clip a bolts and head up in to the business. Most people favor a sneaky undercling to gain a good right hand to get situated on the steeps. A few more powerful moves get you to a mid way ledge. Milk the rest and work your way up the corner above laying back and making some sequency moves to gain the slightly sloping lip (this might be tough if you are pumped). Find the good holds and clip the chains. Topping out is fun and sometimes easier than hanging to clip.  This might be a good 5.12 to do as your first if it fits your style.

The grade is whatever you think the start of B-b-buttress is; 9+ if you climb to the left of the first bolt and keep on your feet.","{107108243: 4, 110762698: 4, 200267777: 4, 200129067: 4, 110739544: 4, 106306579: 4, 106957265: 4, 112810423: 4, 111871900: 4, 200539551: 4, 108911162: 4, 110452119: 4, 200154262: 4, 111666789: 3, 110812900: 3, 111077991: 3, 106191055: 3, 106339890: 3, 107169450: 3, 200041302: 3, 106125724: 3, 109230273: 3, 200143675: 3, 111849990: 3, 112375922: 3, 200437181: 3, 106646308: 3, 110923255: 3, 111844655: 3, 107699201: 3, 200319558: 3, 112166651: 3, 111655010: 3, 110262256: 3, 108222002: 3, 111181604: 3, 106486112: 3, 111909917: 3, 106134707: 3, 107346586: 3, 110317485: 3, 105943577: 3, 107688321: 3, 105906559: 3, 106561728: 3, 106419027: 3, 107629960: 3, 109692317: 3, 200244052: 3, 105885115: 3, 108032974: 3, 106868421: 3, 111468613: 3, 109317339: 3, 106876126: 3, 106662131: 3, 107739229: 3, 111142184: 3, 108245758: 3, 112142591: 2, 106397425: 2, 108943993: 2, 112797688: 2, 111841723: 2, 200259024: 2, 108323817: 2, 112365589: 2, 108200547: 2, 107851075: 2}"

Most routes at the NW Territories cant hold a candle to this awesome 100 ft long low angle dance capped with a super fun corner.    This climb was retro-bolted and it seems like a good thing to me.   It saw no use as a trad climb and now it sees some use as a sport climb. There was even a little chalk on it the other day when i did it.    Start by clipping a bolt from a low ledge and pulling a boulder problem over a block to get on to the main buttress. The boulder problem is the hardest your muscles will work the whole time you are on the route but be prepared for your brain to get pumped as you think your way through the route finding above. Dance your way up the low angle face climbing for 70 feet or so to a stance below a corner. Stem the corner to a tricky but easy step left and clip the anchors with a little effort (you might wish they were a foot lower).    60m ROPE NEEDED TO LOWER OFF!!! ,"{106075659: 4, 105906559: 4, 106720416: 4, 107166148: 4, 105890157: 4, 108145511: 4, 108110667: 4, 107852661: 4, 110522591: 4, 106397425: 4, 10610: 4, 106417094: 4, 111142184: 4, 112010408: 4, 108290010: 4, 112174305: 4, 112030796: 4, 106679659: 4, 107327535: 4, 108189638: 4, 109932626: 4, 105816622: 4, 106764476: 4, 200101052: 4, 110739544: 4, 110756813: 4, 110762698: 4, 200115753: 4, 110985244: 4, 200602398: 4, 200711420: 4, 200267777: 4, 107688321: 3, 105885115: 3, 106134707: 3, 106426493: 3, 106358364: 3, 106971875: 3, 107253475: 3, 108245758: 3, 108894743: 3, 106538248: 3, 106853290: 3, 106868421: 3, 108222002: 3, 106957265: 3, 106662131: 3, 108148725: 3, 109897147: 3, 106967283: 3, 107126711: 3, 110317485: 3, 105943577: 3, 107346586: 3, 105859360: 3, 110262256: 3, 106486112: 3, 107629960: 3, 109324282: 3, 111181604: 3, 112176985: 3, 108323817: 3, 109371843: 3, 106876126: 3, 111278312: 3, 111716091: 3, 108364795: 3, 111657384: 3, 107169450: 3, 109585594: 3, 110812900: 3, 200143675: 3, 106306579: 3, 200263422: 3, 112404909: 3, 108181716: 3, 107783414: 3, 107768989: 3, 110807699: 3, 111884710: 3, 200397150: 3, 200265615: 3, 107851075: 3, 107691094: 3, 107232890: 3, 111650569: 3, 110216439: 3, 200395157: 3, 112142591: 3, 200057419: 3, 106191055: 3, 200305867: 3, 112261455: 3, 200448715: 3, 113077522: 3, 110459495: 3, 107727480: 3, 108540743: 3, 111844655: 3, 200339376: 3, 200129067: 3, 200463147: 3, 106125724: 2, 105963968: 2, 106423391: 2, 107739229: 2, 109269951: 2, 109317339: 2, 107942262: 2, 111841723: 2, 109692317: 2, 108200547: 2, 106646308: 2, 112042073: 2, 200154262: 2, 200406385: 2, 110591893: 2, 200452607: 2, 107969579: 1, 108551353: 1}"

The Crusher,106200868.0,Sport,105884545.0,5.11d,80.0,1.0,3.7,91.0,"Possibly the most classic hard 11 at Rumney?  You be the judge.  While you are climbing this route, remember that it's been climbed barefoot!    This route has multiple sections of hard climbing, all of which offer very unique flow over stunning rock features with eye-popping exposure.    Start this affair on a slab of rock below the steep trail that heads to upper Orange Crush, beneath the roof capping a left-facing corner.     Reach over the void, clip the first bolt and easily traverse over to the corner.  Make technical (but not physically difficult) moves rightward across the face to gain the arete, and a stance.      Step back onto the arete, master this, then tackle the steep, but short face with stout, fingery moves, high feet, and an interesting reach to the looming edge of the overhang above. Pull over the bulge and gain the nice ledge shared with multiple other routes.     Move back left onto the upper face and climb through some steep rock on positive holds to an easy mantle, depositing you at comfortable stance at the base of the crux.    (Get a good shake, as the climbing above is sustained, and is considered the techinical crux of the route.)    Delicately move up the slabby face to a very distinct India-shaped hold.

Start up the nice steep wall playing find-the-jugs. Move right around a corner awkwardly to a stance (harder for shorties). At this point you want to travers right under a steep wall and as you head right and the ground below falls away you feel way exposed. This traverse is scrunchy and yes harder for tall people (evening the score of difficulty for the route). At the end of the traverse you can milk an amazing airy rest stance before entering the money section of the climb, steep hauling on fantasy jugs that just don't end if you choose the traditional finish traversing back left following the weakness to the anchors.

I love it""  Between Predator and the second pitch of Tropicana, 5.11 big steep moves on big holds takes you up high off the Tropicana ledge,. Nearing the top, you can step right and get a good shake, then step down and left to attack the final crux bulge. The climb there changes character to powerful dynamic crimping, slopers and balance moves.  great positioning  With a 70 m rope and some slings on the first pitch and the mid belay anchor to keep the rope running well, this can be linked on top of the first pitch of Orange Crush 5.9 and is a great, really fun long pumpy route. If using this for a warm-up for the harder nearby routes, usually at least the very top has fixed draws, so you can skip the final 5.12 bit if you wish.  This route often suffers from seepage, but as long as you can keep your feet out of it, a little water shouldn't be a problem on the 5.11 part, with the holds being so good. This is also a great barefoot climb. If you come off, you just fly into space.

The line of jugs over your head may feel rather slippery due its extreme popularity (and if you opt NOT to used the feet on the opposing roof to your right...hint, hint!), but don't let that dissuade you--this route is super fun! As one steps from the massive spike that marks the beginning of this route, engaging and sequential moves are encountered all the way to the chains.   The real crux of the route comes about midway out the roof when you are forced to either deadpoint off a hidden letterbox slot or finesse your way on atrociously slopey edges.  Either way you'll end up grappling with a two-handed jug that looks curiously like a gaping Piranha mouth! Finish by surmounting a small roof and traversing right under the final overhang to a couple of pumpy, and airy, moves to the chains.  After you clip the anchors, you will lower off about 40 to 50 feet out from the belayer, so be careful of the looming tree branches below you and the steep bank you will ultimately lower on to.

Fun face climbing.","{106876126: 4, 109101477: 4, 107768989: 4, 110377615: 4, 109581799: 4, 110267985: 4, 200129768: 4, 111163750: 4, 200136973: 4, 107260705: 4, 200105749: 4, 200187667: 4, 108375637: 4, 112207022: 4, 200101052: 4, 7128541: 4, 200711420: 4, 106567319: 3, 107464151: 3, 105933166: 3, 105906559: 3, 106868421: 3, 107852661: 3, 106600250: 3, 106097553: 3, 106590583: 3, 106706501: 3, 106764476: 3, 107085584: 3, 107740836: 3, 108181716: 3, 106486112: 3, 109136692: 3, 107630444: 3, 108222002: 3, 108933008: 3, 108178915: 3, 108547663: 3, 110044455: 3, 106397425: 3, 111142184: 3, 109392078: 3, 107574666: 3, 110970484: 3, 110582478: 3, 107851075: 3, 108290010: 3, 111902978: 3, 108367353: 3, 109324282: 3, 108324210: 3, 111573930: 3, 111181604: 3, 112509814: 3, 107602549: 3, 109467833: 3, 200054289: 3, 112423730: 3, 105943577: 3, 112146574: 3, 107346586: 3, 111825461: 3, 111278312: 3, 106957265: 3, 106440310: 3, 200041302: 3, 200078875: 3, 200312793: 3, 106720416: 3, 112166651: 3, 109692317: 3, 109070886: 3, 200168968: 3, 200074903: 3, 200253647: 3, 105898385: 3, 200297969: 3, 200154262: 3, 200536699: 3, 200445602: 3, 200145579: 3, 200150170: 3, 200191836: 3, 200678844: 3, 109406130: 3, 200253316: 3, 200358728: 3, 200160054: 3, 106860568: 2, 106860562: 2, 105885115: 2, 106971875: 2, 106103271: 2, 106113062: 2, 106125724: 2, 106306579: 2, 106555971: 2, 106873131: 2, 106718918: 2, 106592409: 2, 106358364: 2, 105890157: 2, 106916096: 2, 106455989: 2, 107126711: 2, 106360234: 2, 107492957: 2, 107657353: 2, 108257055: 2, 106967283: 2, 109284031: 2, 108245758: 2, 108200547: 2, 106134707: 2, 109581377: 2, 111087111: 2, 111919506: 2, 111911639: 2, 109545197: 2, 107739229: 2, 110317485: 2, 111875474: 2, 111917126: 2, 112411512: 2, 110762698: 2, 112480961: 2, 111921737: 2, 109585594: 2, 200129067: 2, 111167972: 2, 112322643: 2, 110262256: 2, 200157044: 2, 111716091: 2, 200222531: 2, 108106981: 2, 106646308: 2, 200541836: 2, 200425133: 2, 200374248: 2, 200485328: 2, 107253738: 2, 105832216: 2, 200873496: 2, 200244148: 2, 200580231: 2, 200395157: 2, 110591893: 2, 108096611: 1, 109608840: 1, 110671153: 1, 111844655: 1, 110985244: 1}"
The Original Orange Crush,106495191.0,Trad,105884545.0,5.8,150.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"What follows is the historical description. See Orange Crush - retrobolted for the modern version as it is now climbed.    The original climb was done to breach the left or west side of this cliff. It was a difficult lead to get gear into. Another one of those contrived gear placements routes where falling wasnt optional at the beginning and near to the top of the first pitch. It took a long time to put the gear in near the end of the first pitch while water continuously dripped on my head. I eventually grew weary of the situation. I had to to get over the short head wall bulge left of me, up to the belay ledge. Bill followed up and made the headwall look easy by moving further to the left than I had. We rappelled from there because he was intimidated by the steepness ahead of us. Bill and I named the climb, Orange Crush after the soda and lichen on the cliff, but we were drinking Orangina on that day, and because if I had fallen anywhere on that pitch the gear would likely have failed. I would have been crushed by the fall by the rocks below this pitch. After that I rappelled down to check out the climbing above the first pitch and placed pitons in a precarious place to what would become the direct finish to Orange Crush (Chinese Water Torture). I also placed one pin on the second pitch of Orange Crushs soon to be second pitch. Then Tom Bowker came with me to finish the intimidating steep walls above the first pitch, Bill and I did. I led the whole climb moving right and up for the 2nd pitch and doing the third pitch almost in the dark that had difficult gear placements. Then I came to the hardest move on the climb. After that it was finished. Tom was mentally challenged climbing it and taking the gear out finishing the climb in the dark.     The climb begins directly above or ahead to where the new staircase has been placed. Once on the rock traverse right awkwardly (5-6) clipping (you have to be kidding me) pins. After the traverse move up into vegetated area with some decent protection. From there move up and left to a notch and finagle some opposition protection into the rock cavities. Move up and left over bulge (5-7+) or move further left to the v-groove (5-6). Belay on the long horizontal ledge. Move right to the inside corner facing left and climb it to the second belay ledge (5-8-). From this ledge move up and left to overhanging set of bulges. Go through these bulges surprisingly easy (5-6) and well protected but it was strenuous to create the opposition placements of small wires necessary. After the bulges enter the brown dike. Run it out a little until in the center of the dike is a vertical pocket (5-8). Originally a weird looking angle pin was nailed into it. Later the pin was removed because a Tri-cam fit more securely. This is an awfully scary spot but the fear can be diminished if you'll look to the left, there is a good sloped hold for your left hand to grasp onto (slightly dirty, blow on it first). Make a high step up and move left off of the dike to make a belay or continue up to the blueberry ledges above this cliff. If you go to the top hearing each other is difficult.      I very much enjoyed this climb. I enjoyed it's steepness at a moderate grade. I climbed it regularly. All of the climbers that liked clean rock besides Tom Bowker didn't do this route. I don't recall anyone else leading it then, though. This will never be a climb for a (5-8) is your highest ability as a traditional climber. The falls in many places would be injurious regardless of whether the protection held or not.","{105906559: 2, 106178530: 2, 105885115: 2}"

Predator,105884551.0,Sport,105884545.0,5.13b,0.0,1.0,4.0,67.0,"You have seen images of this unmistakeable overhanging prow in magazines, on guidebook covers, and in climbing videos. You have wondered where this amazing piece of rock could possibly exist.    The climb is called The Predator and it exists at Orange Crush.    Long and steadily overhanging, but with few stopper moves, Predator is a popular first 13b. However, getting to the base is involved. Climb the first pitch of Tropicana (11a) and belay at two eye bolts on a perfect flat ledge. It is also possible to access this ledge from the left, starting up The Crusher and traversing straight around the corner to the ledge. If one pulls on bolts, it's possible to do this in approach shoes (5.6 A0).       After getting a vote of confidence from your belayer, it's time to head upward. The start holds a few 5.10ish moves and the climbing quickly turns to 5.8 jug hauling. A sit-down rest provides an opprtunity to regroup and consider the hanging prow. Though actually about 45 degrees overhanging, the perspective from the rest suggests that the prow is much steeper. A hard pull gains the prow after which crimps and deadpoints continue until the final crux sequence.     This crux involves a big deadpoint, or for style points, a most-points off dyno to a jug. Energy sapping moves on the arete proper lead to the lip. The topout, though mentally and physically taxing, is recommended by some and required by others. The choice is yours, but you are the one who has to look yourself in the mirror in the morning.  youtube.com/watch?v=jtrg4Va…","{7128541: 4, 109884427: 4, 111841723: 4, 200296165: 4, 106125724: 4, 107561202: 4, 200259232: 4, 109371843: 4, 200175107: 4, 107801617: 4, 106538248: 4, 112935042: 4, 110166994: 4, 108270237: 4, 109090667: 4, 109467833: 4, 110446085: 4, 107102487: 4, 200518479: 4, 200057419: 4, 108398478: 4, 107711888: 4, 200246689: 4, 108245758: 4, 111181604: 4, 111878504: 4, 110262051: 4, 200209467: 4, 200253647: 4, 108181716: 4, 110859486: 4, 110689679: 4, 108032974: 4, 110294685: 4, 106347294: 4, 109101477: 4, 106702886: 4, 106215535: 4, 106153684: 4, 107026497: 4, 106646308: 4, 12525: 4, 105885115: 4, 106440358: 4, 106206960: 4, 105943577: 4, 105906559: 4, 10610: 4, 108512985: 4, 107991333: 4, 106425299: 4, 110943022: 4, 106876126: 4, 11509: 4, 107941619: 4, 108276722: 4, 111150658: 4, 106492500: 4, 106108710: 4, 110970484: 4, 109165306: 4, 109355903: 4, 105938601: 4, 109575088: 4, 107056968: 3, 106532847: 3, 107327605: 3}"

I like to clip the second bolt, as there is a tough move above the first and I am affraid of hitting the deck, but it is a little bit high and hard to reach with a stick clip, so bring a long stick.  If your stick is somewhat inadequate (hehe) it's pretty easy to clip the bolt if you traverse from the left (start of Black Mamba) but I feel that you would need to lower off to do the opening moves.

Now I highly recommend it.","{200383321: 4, 108363879: 4, 106103271: 4, 106647777: 4, 200230025: 3, 106912253: 3, 110750765: 3, 200602398: 3, 106967283: 3, 112411512: 3, 110262256: 3, 110293668: 3, 106397425: 3, 107739229: 3, 107473980: 3, 111181604: 3, 109102869: 3, 111844655: 3, 106879280: 3, 112354658: 3, 105832216: 3, 106378848: 3, 106538248: 3, 7073220: 3, 200063563: 3, 112010408: 3, 108290010: 3, 106423391: 3, 105879342: 3, 106347294: 3, 105945019: 3, 106125724: 3, 106486112: 3, 105898385: 3, 105943577: 3, 106876126: 3, 107743379: 3, 105839151: 3, 106720416: 3, 105906559: 3, 106134707: 3, 107969579: 3, 106903165: 3, 109648338: 3, 107851075: 2, 106646308: 2, 110294685: 2, 111063806: 2, 108245758: 2, 106011053: 2, 107400819: 2, 106922041: 2, 107346586: 2, 105885115: 2, 107492957: 2, 107085584: 2, 105890157: 2, 108625148: 1}"

It's also a bit longer than it looks.    Climb the chimney clipping bolts on the left past some bad rock to a good stance continue up the chimney as the rock gets better clip bolts on the right. Many options for beta i ended up pulling a corkscrew move which is always fun.

Centerfold,106071424.0,Trad,105898430.0,5.4,0.0,1.0,0.7,7.0,"More popular and more fun as an ice climb, i recommend waiting till it freezes to climb it. The climbing is actually pretty cool but there are a few BIG down sides. It is quite vegetated, wet, muddy, and on top of all this its pretty poorly protected oh and a few loose rocks. If you mess up on this climb chances are you will hurt your self and a few people below since this is a crowded cliff most days. If you do choose to climb it make sure there is no one below you and you are up for a poorly protected adventure.    Start under Egg McMeadows and follow easy holds up and right in to the vegetated grove to the right of that climb. Climb poorly protected but moderate rock till you get a stance and place some gear under a steeper wall. Move left on dirty slab and up to a dirt/mud gully.

Chloe's Breakfast Special,105900343.0,Sport,105898430.0,5.8,70.0,1.0,2.5,165.0,"Its dirty appearance doesn't do it justice--this route is two-star quality as both an end-of-day warm-down, or a nice, early morning warm-up.      Start up low-angle rock at the right end of the cliff, about 10 feet from the stepped, left-facing corner and just right of the dirty gully. (Don't be confused--Chloe's is the third line of bolts left of the corner!!).  Clip a couple of bolts while wandering up the slab, clip another bolt at your face, then pass over a quartz dike and step into the climb proper.  From here, the route takes you up a fairly innocuous-looking face, littered with great edges, surprise incuts, positive footholds, and fabulous positioning.  You will encounter one mantle shelf at about mid-height, then another about 10 feet from the anchors.      Despite the number of holds in your face, Chloe's hides a killer sequence of movements that, once unlocked, flows beautifully.  Quick clips at the top.

In the winter it is a really cool ice climb called Franky Lee.    Follow flakes using a bunch of layback moves with nice jugs between. Good footwork will pay off if this route is at your limit.

A good route to keep you climbing while you wait for other climbs to open up.","{200151702: 4, 106698297: 3, 106271741: 3, 105913936: 3, 106399472: 3, 106408932: 3, 106869562: 3, 106873076: 3, 108240824: 3, 109006073: 3, 108463738: 3, 111546553: 3, 110259196: 3, 200056643: 3, 112293388: 3, 111914864: 3, 111716091: 3, 108314447: 3, 200471628: 3, 200337035: 3, 108048090: 3, 106764476: 2, 107516555: 2, 106726952: 2, 106535235: 2, 107740836: 2, 107464151: 2, 107434141: 2, 107430471: 2, 107852661: 2, 107651072: 2, 107688321: 2, 107727693: 2, 106207073: 2, 106219552: 2, 106868421: 2, 106378848: 2, 106257523: 2, 106358364: 2, 106434727: 2, 106113062: 2, 106469016: 2, 106600250: 2, 106347294: 2, 106417094: 2, 106767622: 2, 106590583: 2, 106205646: 2, 105941791: 2, 106860568: 2, 106928886: 2, 107064260: 2, 106397425: 2, 107336862: 2, 108093743: 2, 108145511: 2, 108147849: 2, 108193208: 2, 107702396: 2, 105835839: 2, 106679659: 2, 107942262: 2, 108362846: 2, 106360234: 2, 108188495: 2, 108245630: 2, 108416778: 2, 108157281: 2, 107656321: 2, 108462136: 2, 107768989: 2, 108652563: 2, 106521221: 2, 108993984: 2, 108207363: 2, 107842362: 2, 108736383: 2, 109268194: 2, 107763339: 2, 108363423: 2, 107830036: 2, 108257055: 2, 108245758: 2, 106586268: 2, 109897147: 2, 109856888: 2, 110724330: 2, 108252197: 2, 107917066: 2, 108179333: 2, 108367353: 2, 110317485: 2, 109135839: 2, 110547878: 2, 109193524: 2, 106917454: 2, 111822433: 2, 108323817: 2, 110327172: 2, 111917126: 2, 111902978: 2, 107929356: 2, 111972941: 2, 110363121: 2, 109454067: 2, 111520764: 2, 107169450: 2, 111970633: 2, 108473722: 2, 110580188: 2, 111004308: 2, 111737844: 2, 111796230: 2, 112232532: 2, 110631955: 2, 110762698: 2, 112324365: 2, 111280577: 2, 112922257: 2, 111181604: 2, 112797688: 2, 112064732: 2, 200038840: 2, 112174305: 2, 111229703: 2, 112210382: 2, 200096929: 2, 107327535: 2, 112341216: 2, 113317393: 2, 200074903: 2, 113453662: 2, 109324282: 2, 200129067: 2, 112411512: 2, 111850821: 2, 200067404: 2, 112011389: 2, 110989228: 2, 200041302: 2, 108112688: 2, 110750765: 2, 200163324: 2, 107318493: 2, 109017895: 2, 200057050: 2, 200167620: 2, 200064982: 2, 200265615: 2, 200101052: 2, 112042073: 2, 7128541: 2, 200032274: 2, 200075761: 2, 200078875: 2, 106306579: 2, 109414386: 2, 112207022: 2, 111136253: 2, 110454201: 2, 111626403: 2, 200485328: 2, 110712867: 2, 200499719: 2, 107851075: 2, 200320317: 2, 200497261: 2, 112038160: 2, 200342646: 2, 113077522: 2, 200297969: 2, 200416944: 2, 200177688: 2, 200314873: 2, 200222515: 2, 105832216: 2, 200208380: 2, 112025175: 2, 112401943: 2, 200651605: 2, 200253316: 2, 200512846: 2, 107253738: 2, 106567319: 1, 105906559: 1, 106912253: 1, 105829522: 1, 105971523: 1, 105839151: 1, 105938601: 1, 106762873: 1, 10186: 1, 105943577: 1, 107743379: 1, 106075659: 1, 107492957: 1, 106299993: 1, 106399334: 1, 105801390: 1, 106125724: 1, 106486112: 1, 106751248: 1, 106134707: 1, 105889415: 1, 105890157: 1, 106822110: 1, 105811645: 1, 106971875: 1, 107126711: 1, 106957265: 1, 108217726: 1, 108011499: 1, 107793593: 1, 107059376: 1, 108073727: 1, 108321896: 1, 108222002: 1, 106957540: 1, 106876126: 1, 106647777: 1, 107682885: 1, 108110667: 1, 107385412: 1, 107657353: 1, 109073630: 1, 108335441: 1, 109638995: 1, 107377680: 1, 107085584: 1, 106967283: 1, 107107345: 1, 108200547: 1, 107739229: 1, 107723931: 1, 106788981: 1, 110457315: 1, 110942549: 1, 110185189: 1, 107723439: 1, 111167972: 1, 111066391: 1, 108290010: 1, 110841071: 1, 110365118: 1, 111081279: 1, 112077859: 1, 108436633: 1, 111744118: 1, 106662131: 1, 111657818: 1, 111811598: 1, 111414778: 1, 108985245: 1, 107373999: 1, 109355254: 1, 107346586: 1, 111825461: 1, 109052547: 1, 112096893: 1, 111928324: 1, 112166651: 1, 112091056: 1, 111666789: 1, 200259024: 1, 110341322: 1, 111610436: 1, 110165451: 1, 109932626: 1, 200264338: 1, 200154910: 1, 111844655: 1, 107691094: 1, 200281875: 1, 200374248: 1, 200063563: 1, 111650569: 1, 200294199: 1, 200469947: 1, 112138817: 1, 200402086: 1, 200581161: 1, 200249961: 1, 200368580: 1, 112212516: 1, 200584602: 1, 200244148: 1, 200591925: 1, 200160054: 1, 111031033: 0, 112338674: 0}"

Boulder up a suprisingly hard start to clip the first bolt, or stick clip if you're not feeling saucy. After you've clipped you'll be met by the crux: a ten foot section of technical slab climbing with thin slopers and crimps. The hands are awful in this section, though they can easily be overcome by creative, precise footwork. After firing the crux and clipping the third bolt, head up and right where you will be met with delightful 5.7 climbing to the chains.    Easily Aroused presents a great opportunity to improve on your technical footwork and build crimp strength without working up too much of a sweat... that is if you can keep it together while clipping the first few bolts. Definitely hard at the grade, though fun nonetheless.","{112210382: 4, 106554217: 4, 105913936: 3, 106113062: 3, 106205646: 3, 106430658: 3, 105811645: 3, 106360234: 3, 107287218: 3, 109006073: 3, 111816794: 3, 110365118: 3, 200056643: 3, 200081629: 3, 200096929: 3, 108314447: 3, 109324282: 3, 110638625: 3, 109052547: 3, 109968442: 3, 200064982: 3, 111626403: 3, 200414254: 3, 106726952: 2, 105829522: 2, 105961696: 2, 107727693: 2, 106257523: 2, 107878732: 2, 106868421: 2, 105889415: 2, 106103271: 2, 106125724: 2, 106526770: 2, 106399472: 2, 106417094: 2, 105890157: 2, 107064260: 2, 107347295: 2, 106928886: 2, 107898897: 2, 108193208: 2, 108087249: 2, 108050314: 2, 106679659: 2, 108222002: 2, 107254662: 2, 108933008: 2, 106957540: 2, 108157281: 2, 106647777: 2, 108244717: 2, 107763339: 2, 108245758: 2, 109679405: 2, 107377680: 2, 108437225: 2, 108110667: 2, 108179333: 2, 106423391: 2, 110317485: 2, 109135839: 2, 107852661: 2, 108367353: 2, 111902978: 2, 111844655: 2, 109454067: 2, 111970633: 2, 108473722: 2, 111822624: 2, 111081279: 2, 111682044: 2, 112166651: 2, 110900723: 2, 106917454: 2, 108323817: 2, 106210225: 2, 112230384: 2, 111181604: 2, 110356941: 2, 112341216: 2, 109355254: 2, 110762698: 2, 111999314: 2, 112042073: 2, 108112688: 2, 110750765: 2, 109017895: 2, 200057050: 2, 111825461: 2, 200265615: 2, 200078875: 2, 200481622: 2, 110712867: 2, 200101052: 2, 105832216: 2, 112038160: 2, 200509774: 2, 106764476: 1, 106271741: 1, 105938601: 1, 105906559: 1, 105839151: 1, 106912253: 1, 10186: 1, 105943577: 1, 107743379: 1, 108894743: 1, 106219552: 1, 106306579: 1, 106191055: 1, 106358784: 1, 106134707: 1, 106358364: 1, 106751248: 1, 106860568: 1, 106409983: 1, 106576182: 1, 106971875: 1, 105885115: 1, 107126711: 1, 106957265: 1, 108145511: 1, 106397425: 1, 108217726: 1, 108049103: 1, 108073727: 1, 107346586: 1, 106876126: 1, 108202763: 1, 108855374: 1, 107698881: 1, 109027015: 1, 106967283: 1, 107107345: 1, 109269951: 1, 110424351: 1, 107739229: 1, 109692317: 1, 106788981: 1, 110863417: 1, 107042723: 1, 108711491: 1, 111822433: 1, 108290010: 1, 107929356: 1, 107085584: 1, 110395141: 1, 111875474: 1, 111414778: 1, 107851075: 1, 200105749: 1, 110989228: 1, 200116081: 1, 111928324: 1, 108200547: 1, 110165451: 1, 200074903: 1, 110454201: 1, 200298970: 1, 109788726: 1, 200281875: 1, 200264338: 1, 200063563: 1, 112134112: 1, 200368580: 1, 200160054: 1, 106822110: 0, 107470987: 0, 110720228: 0, 106662131: 0, 112091056: 0}"

Slightly overhanging with bad holds and some good ones too.    Start just at the top of the newly added stairs at the left end of the crag. Climb to the left of the big oak tree. the route starts easy and climbs like a good low angle warm up to a ledge where things steepen. make your way between crimps to incuts and even a few jugs. The feet are right where you need them as youhead for the horizontal break. When you hit the break the style of climbing changes as you pass a small overhang on juggy holds (but its a little tricky). clip the chains and say.

Mr. Coffee,106009341.0,Sport,105898430.0,5.11a,0.0,1.0,1.2,26.0,I'm torn on this route cause it has cool moves for sure and some beautiful jugs on steep rock. However it reminds me a bit of Bone Head Roof (5.10) at the Meadows in that when you are pulling the crux you are really counting on your belayer to keep you off the ledge below you. that aspect makes it slightly less attractive.    Climb up the 5.9 boulder problem start to a big ledge. Walk over to the bolt under the big roof clip it and decide hoe you want to tackle this thing. Surprisingly nice jugs lead to the only non jug on the upper section which is the crux. After that you can stand up and clip the chains.,"{105832216: 3, 200230025: 3, 106764476: 2, 110762698: 2, 107851075: 2, 108245758: 2, 106306579: 1, 105906559: 1, 200101052: 1, 106103271: 1, 200150489: 1, 106912253: 1, 108290010: 1, 105898385: 1, 110262256: 1, 107969579: 1, 106358364: 1, 105890157: 1, 106971875: 1, 106561728: 1, 107346586: 1, 105885115: 1, 106577584: 1, 106125724: 1, 107470987: 0, 112166651: 0}"

This is one of the better routes on the center section of the crag (there are a few squeezed in lines here now that are pretty generic).but this one is recommended.","{107347962: 4, 106306579: 4, 106408932: 4, 106873076: 4, 108257055: 4, 109006073: 4, 107842362: 4, 111295731: 4, 112922257: 4, 200056643: 4, 112210382: 4, 200567092: 4, 106764476: 3, 107688321: 3, 106397425: 3, 107740836: 3, 107464151: 3, 106075659: 3, 107852661: 3, 106219552: 3, 106358364: 3, 106113062: 3, 106130656: 3, 106549436: 3, 106600250: 3, 106347294: 3, 106417094: 3, 106134707: 3, 106224533: 3, 105889415: 3, 106860562: 3, 105811645: 3, 106928886: 3, 107253738: 3, 107347295: 3, 108147849: 3, 108193208: 3, 107844469: 3, 108049103: 3, 108011499: 3, 106679659: 3, 106360234: 3, 106957265: 3, 106930964: 3, 108188495: 3, 108148725: 3, 105913936: 3, 106957540: 3, 107287218: 3, 107698881: 3, 108588676: 3, 108323817: 3, 108856447: 3, 106586268: 3, 108652563: 3, 109485507: 3, 109268194: 3, 107763339: 3, 108363423: 3, 107085584: 3, 108245758: 3, 109545197: 3, 106466703: 3, 110452119: 3, 110416235: 3, 109897147: 3, 108547663: 3, 108463738: 3, 108179333: 3, 107686628: 3, 110964025: 3, 106423391: 3, 110317485: 3, 110588804: 3, 109193524: 3, 110762698: 3, 111816794: 3, 111822433: 3, 106889145: 3, 110327172: 3, 110315255: 3, 111917126: 3, 111844655: 3, 111970633: 3, 111972941: 3, 110356941: 3, 108473722: 3, 112100767: 3, 111755066: 3, 112153448: 3, 111744118: 3, 111181604: 3, 111779719: 3, 112038160: 3, 111610436: 3, 111811598: 3, 112174305: 3, 107373999: 3, 107346586: 3, 112293388: 3, 111229703: 3, 112341216: 3, 108406663: 3, 110262256: 3, 112166651: 3, 108314447: 3, 111999314: 3, 200067404: 3, 200041302: 3, 108112688: 3, 200163324: 3, 108052453: 3, 109017895: 3, 109968442: 3, 113437089: 3, 200167620: 3, 112371083: 3, 110341322: 3, 200064982: 3, 106554217: 3, 200064863: 3, 111004308: 3, 112190078: 3, 109414386: 3, 110875851: 3, 110689679: 3, 111626403: 3, 200129067: 3, 200499719: 3, 111902124: 3, 200541836: 3, 200536699: 3, 112207022: 3, 200222515: 3, 105832216: 3, 200078447: 3, 200601858: 3, 200873496: 3, 200244148: 3, 108787509: 3, 200633661: 3, 200568481: 3, 200946477: 3, 105941791: 2, 106970957: 2, 106726952: 2, 106535235: 2, 105906559: 2, 105971523: 2, 107247400: 2, 10186: 2, 107743379: 2, 107512961: 2, 107651072: 2, 105943577: 2, 105898385: 2, 105961696: 2, 106207073: 2, 105801390: 2, 106271741: 2, 107878732: 2, 106868421: 2, 106399334: 2, 106386213: 2, 106358784: 2, 106155889: 2, 106526770: 2, 106486112: 2, 106767622: 2, 106590583: 2, 105890157: 2, 106844475: 2, 106807311: 2, 106853290: 2, 106699022: 2, 106860568: 2, 107189674: 2, 106971875: 2, 107126711: 2, 107153515: 2, 107336862: 2, 107898897: 2, 107328064: 2, 108093743: 2, 108125179: 2, 108222002: 2, 106897206: 2, 107254662: 2, 108364687: 2, 106876126: 2, 108157281: 2, 107723439: 2, 108462136: 2, 108855374: 2, 107682885: 2, 108110667: 2, 109027015: 2, 107385412: 2, 108048090: 2, 108993984: 2, 108335441: 2, 109498955: 2, 107830036: 2, 109638995: 2, 107377680: 2, 106967283: 2, 107768989: 2, 108437225: 2, 107723931: 2, 107739229: 2, 106788981: 2, 109856891: 2, 107917066: 2, 110457315: 2, 110863417: 2, 108200547: 2, 109135839: 2, 107000115: 2, 110547878: 2, 111142184: 2, 108711491: 2, 108367353: 2, 108189638: 2, 111909917: 2, 108290010: 2, 111921579: 2, 105859360: 2, 110365118: 2, 110363121: 2, 110878282: 2, 111520764: 2, 111081279: 2, 110580188: 2, 111656243: 2, 111914048: 2, 112164950: 2, 108436633: 2, 110631955: 2, 111031033: 2, 112509814: 2, 106917454: 2, 112324365: 2, 106793247: 2, 112247638: 2, 106210225: 2, 111280577: 2, 111414778: 2, 111857342: 2, 108985245: 2, 111344408: 2, 112134112: 2, 110315426: 2, 111650569: 2, 200074903: 2, 113453662: 2, 109324282: 2, 200151702: 2, 111825461: 2, 110720228: 2, 109086735: 2, 110989228: 2, 111796230: 2, 106440310: 2, 200105749: 2, 111928324: 2, 112091056: 2, 112797688: 2, 200084964: 2, 200264338: 2, 110165451: 2, 109932626: 2, 112042073: 2, 200265615: 2, 200171228: 2, 200168968: 2, 107851075: 2, 110839245: 2, 111502816: 2, 107691094: 2, 200437181: 2, 200249961: 2, 200101052: 2, 200296165: 2, 110942549: 2, 113187400: 2, 200063563: 2, 200402086: 2, 200485328: 2, 200581858: 2, 107920500: 2, 200368580: 2, 200314873: 2, 200469947: 2, 200651605: 2, 200384668: 2, 200160054: 2, 105839151: 1, 105938601: 1, 106299993: 1, 106125724: 1, 106751248: 1, 108217726: 1, 108244717: 1, 108145511: 1, 107107345: 1, 109393254: 1, 109269951: 1, 109052547: 1, 111687698: 1, 109505100: 1, 110900723: 1, 107059069: 1, 200259024: 1, 200321317: 1, 200281875: 1, 110591893: 1, 106180018: 1, 111380201: 1, 108134066: 0}"

From those anchors  at the big ledge/chimney with the tree  follow moderate terrain and good ledges up to the base of a steep headwall.  Move through the thin, technical crimp moves (crux) to increasingly better holds/flakes that trend up and slightly left to a 2-bolt ring anchor.  Best done as one push from the ground by clipping a draw to the anchor of Easily Amused for a complete long route to the top of the cliff.  It may also be done as an independent second pitch after that route, or by traversing in from the second big ledge of Glory Jeans (5.6), where that route traverses left.    Please do not top rope off the ring anchors, which decreases their lifespan and safety.  Instead, place your own draws, and have the last climber in your party thread the rings and rappel (not lower).","{108463738: 4, 200509774: 4, 106764476: 3, 105890286: 3, 106347294: 3, 107064260: 3, 108363423: 3, 108179333: 3, 111167972: 3, 108323817: 3, 111902978: 3, 111972941: 3, 112176985: 3, 106210225: 3, 110762698: 3, 111169936: 3, 200259024: 3, 200177688: 3, 200634716: 3, 200798343: 3, 106271741: 2, 107658815: 2, 106762873: 2, 107743379: 2, 107727693: 2, 106358364: 2, 106573024: 2, 106134707: 2, 105906559: 2, 106113062: 2, 106486112: 2, 106592409: 2, 105890157: 2, 106417094: 2, 106423391: 2, 106430658: 2, 105941791: 2, 106561728: 2, 106853290: 2, 106971875: 2, 107126711: 2, 106726952: 2, 106751248: 2, 108193208: 2, 106928886: 2, 108257055: 2, 106397425: 2, 106876126: 2, 108157281: 2, 106647777: 2, 107768989: 2, 106521221: 2, 106868421: 2, 106586268: 2, 107107345: 2, 105943577: 2, 108200547: 2, 107739229: 2, 107723931: 2, 106957265: 2, 108252197: 2, 110863417: 2, 107042723: 2, 110185189: 2, 108367353: 2, 107852661: 2, 110365118: 2, 107169450: 2, 105859360: 2, 108222002: 2, 111181604: 2, 107801617: 2, 111657818: 2, 110900723: 2, 106917454: 2, 111280577: 2, 112922257: 2, 112797688: 2, 200056643: 2, 112230384: 2, 200096929: 2, 107327535: 2, 113317393: 2, 108290010: 2, 108436633: 2, 111999314: 2, 112042073: 2, 108112688: 2, 110750765: 2, 107346586: 2, 106306579: 2, 111928324: 2, 111666789: 2, 110712867: 2, 110341322: 2, 200064982: 2, 200101052: 2, 200312756: 2, 7128541: 2, 200154910: 2, 111844655: 2, 200075761: 2, 200078875: 2, 112166651: 2, 107473980: 2, 107851075: 2, 112207022: 2, 200074903: 2, 110452119: 2, 110942549: 2, 113187400: 2, 200063563: 2, 200293272: 2, 200249056: 2, 200469947: 2, 200320317: 2, 200402086: 2, 200241423: 2, 200101883: 2, 107400819: 2, 105832216: 2, 200145352: 2, 107492957: 1, 107763339: 1, 107085584: 1, 106967283: 1, 110457315: 1, 107723439: 1, 111066391: 1, 110259196: 1, 105812807: 1, 112134112: 1, 200129067: 1, 109585594: 1, 110728444: 1, 109932626: 1, 200374248: 1, 200294199: 1, 200416944: 1, 108981414: 1, 111718531: 0, 112091056: 0}"

Rumor has it that it was sent a few seasons ago.     Start under the roof on a good jug and no feet but the ones above your head. Small crimps and tricky feet are enough to get you powerfully to a good hold. Then power up and shoot for a jug above the lone glue in bolt. From here I led straight up with trad gear then traversed right to the last bolt on Espresso then finished on that so I could use it's anchor. I'm not sure where the first ascent finished but straight up was dirty and lacked an anchor as far as I could see.     The bouldery start is quite good in my opinion. The upper section is much easier and nothing special as far as movement goes. It would get done some if it was bolted.,"{106967283: 4, 105906559: 2}"

It is a steep intimidating line up beautiful rock, passing kneebars and other interesting rest spots. Use the rests, you will need them.

When you reach the steep stuff, move left and over the first bulge finding a few choices of kneebars. After a good rest you move up in to the crux involving a few fairly bad holds and a high, right foot to a huge undercling. This where it gets pumpy for me.

After the last bolt make a tricky move right and up on to the ledge, clip the anchors for Cliff Notes and get someone to follow it cause its easier that way.","{109193524: 4, 109884416: 4, 110317485: 4, 111181604: 3, 107126711: 3, 112024986: 3, 106834913: 3, 106469016: 3, 200041302: 3, 108362846: 3, 107768989: 3, 108257055: 3, 112121569: 3, 110762698: 3, 109324282: 3, 109581799: 3, 111169936: 3, 110705741: 3, 113456219: 3, 106358364: 3, 105943577: 3, 200485328: 3, 106358784: 3, 106124998: 3, 200057419: 3, 106600250: 3, 106075659: 3, 105906559: 3, 200084430: 2, 200423818: 2, 200150170: 2, 109383300: 2, 111914048: 2, 110756813: 2, 200469947: 2, 108832516: 2, 106646308: 2, 200101052: 2, 200374248: 2, 200078875: 2, 200281875: 2, 111650569: 2, 111825461: 2, 110591893: 2, 200105749: 2, 108364795: 2, 200074903: 2, 112066146: 2, 112207022: 2, 110262256: 2, 110259196: 2, 107346586: 2, 111142184: 2, 106971875: 2, 106426493: 2, 106417094: 2, 106486112: 2, 106134707: 2, 106306579: 2, 105832216: 2, 106590583: 2, 106378848: 2, 105898385: 2, 10610: 2, 106103271: 2, 106876126: 2, 106397425: 2, 106860568: 2, 105890157: 2, 105913936: 2, 107763339: 2, 110522591: 2, 108245758: 2, 108323817: 2, 107852661: 2, 106917454: 2, 107430471: 2, 108222002: 2, 108217726: 2, 108200547: 2, 106967283: 2, 108188495: 1, 112116639: 1, 111841723: 1, 110875851: 1, 106125724: 1, 110739544: 1, 200154750: 1, 105938601: 1, 106868421: 1, 107602549: 1}"

Under-clings lead to a good layback that gives you the reach to get the next bolt and a hand on the ledge above.

Climb the moderate slab to a roomy ledge where you will be able to clip 2 or 3 bolts before you really have to commit. This is where the fun begins. Make your way left under the roof toward the arete feature, the holds are a bit awkward and indistinct.

Every time I saw it I just felt like it needed to be finished. I finally got around to adding a few more bolts and climbing the surprisingly enjoyable route.    Climb up on to the slab clipping the first bolt then scampering up another little bit to a stance where it steepens to vertical. Clip the high 2nd bolt (I might add one more at some point so this isn't run out... what do you think?). Climb around to the right and back left to gain a solid knee bar. To this point it's about 5.9ish. Powerful moves tackle the steep bulge above. Long arms and a few tricks will help make this section reasonable.    The crux for me is dyno move at the lip of the bulge. spring from a couple of crimps and bad feet out right to your choice of a few good holds. You can make the last clip from here easily. Just when you think it is over you need to wrestle a few slopers to gain the chains. Might be other options up here, time will tell.    I found the moves to be really fun.

Chris Hassig's Memorial Route,107233564.0,Trad,106724683.0,5.10,70.0,1.0,1.5,4.0,The dike gully that is the winter ice climb 'K9' done by Chris Hassig now has a sport route on the wall right of the gully. The climb has not been cleaned yet. We ascended it lichen covered. It begins by a boulder problem. When the dike is dry a (5.5) start can be done. Otherwise the center of this grey rock can be done at (5.8). After the 10ft boulder problem the grade drops to (5.4). So the first bolt is twenty feet up. That is the (R) section. The remainder of the climb is (PG). Climb directly up past the bolts until able to move right onto ramp (5.9). There is a cammed into place 5lb rock you'll climb pass. It's solid for now. At this section your belayer can move around right out of the way of this boxed in gully. Belaying at the top of this boxed in gully is very much not recommened and wearing a helmet is recommened. Getting unto the ramp is tricky and the ramp is easier. Ramp ends at the ceiling. There is a large block within the ceiling. Getting over the block and past this ceiling is the 10ft crux. There are two possibly loose rocks left of this giant block. You'll be way off route. Don't touch them because if they are loose you'll likely kill your belayer and other climbers below. After the ceiling to the right is a foot ledge and there are three bolts for rappel. I'll clean the route of its lichen. The lichen on the lower section is slippery and the upper lichen covers a climber with black crumbs. I didn't get the ceiling crux because I wasted my arms putting in two bolts on the lead and pushing loose flakes above the block into its reccesses. Ryan's ceiling lead was done by hang dogging the (5.10) crux and I held onto slings to clip on the lower section. It's an exciting climb. If the (5.10) section can not be done by someone you can lower off the two bolts below the block. I tried to do a rope solo of it and retreated after the first bolt placement. The rest was rappel bolted except for two bolts done on the lead.,"{106178530: 2, 200478191: 2, 105943577: 1, 105906559: 1}"

The climb is on clean enough doable rock, in a not so clean rock area. Climbing traffic would improve the surface. It has not been brushed and is in its natural condition.         Start at the cracked rock, shallow overhang bulge that is (5.7) stopper protected. Go direct to pin and move left to a large flake horn to hero loop. Clip bolt above the flake. Move right and up to get to another bolt (5.8) and higher right pin at stance. Go past pin and move left to giant protruding rock (the blade) that was the aided crux. This crux required a shallow pin placement after a bolt (5.7) drilling placement. The pin popped out on the first try. Second try shallow tied off pin held. Placed last bolt and pin above the crux for rappel. Checked out moves and probably (5.? )free. Did not have the stamina to finish it to a higher stance. I was climbing with an immediately injured wrist. Fell hiking to climb. I intended to go left after stance at base of ramp to clean inclining corner crack facing right (I was seeing things). Directly up Looked very nice also (very dirty above anchors). Intended to go higher and mantle onto the tree ledge. Here there 20ft high and wide quartz wall. Probably a free way up it, it being quartz.       The blade of rock definitely goes free with a lot of sequential arm power or otherwise our inability too lift our legs into it. Frustrating and I got through some of it before not getting over the crux (C0). The climb goes PG13 after that, with easier as you get higher moves to do for the rappel anchors. Moss and lichen above here or entering the 'Lichen Dike' is doable. The route stops 10-12ft above last bolt at the stance.

This route is also good for the beginner looking for their first 5.10, it is fun, the moves need to be sussed and it has a clear crux.","{200371045: 4, 200463147: 4, 106108233: 3, 105996406: 3, 108167720: 3, 109483250: 3, 113488095: 3, 200228539: 3, 111560032: 3, 106860562: 2, 105906559: 2, 107385412: 2, 106912253: 2, 105933166: 2, 106555971: 2, 106103271: 2, 107512961: 2, 106134707: 2, 106075659: 2, 106386213: 2, 106421243: 2, 106344939: 2, 106306579: 2, 106358364: 2, 106486112: 2, 106417094: 2, 106844475: 2, 106423391: 2, 106469016: 2, 107124601: 2, 106358784: 2, 106928959: 2, 105885115: 2, 109136692: 2, 108181716: 2, 107630444: 2, 108137876: 2, 106822110: 2, 107134664: 2, 108188495: 2, 107430471: 2, 106646308: 2, 108202763: 2, 109268194: 2, 106590583: 2, 106397425: 2, 107852661: 2, 109111514: 2, 107739229: 2, 108463738: 2, 106108710: 2, 107942262: 2, 106662131: 2, 106398706: 2, 108200547: 2, 106917454: 2, 110522591: 2, 107629960: 2, 111727915: 2, 106107825: 2, 110580188: 2, 110762698: 2, 109737113: 2, 111546553: 2, 111169936: 2, 107346586: 2, 108693865: 2, 111928487: 2, 112166651: 2, 200067404: 2, 200281875: 2, 200041302: 2, 108911162: 2, 110756813: 2, 105832216: 2, 200155809: 2, 200408941: 2, 200129067: 2, 112207022: 2, 106751248: 1, 105943577: 1, 105839151: 1, 105898385: 1, 106125724: 1, 10610: 1, 106698297: 1, 106928886: 1, 107870857: 1, 107698881: 1, 108245758: 1, 108832516: 1, 107851075: 1, 105913936: 1, 108257055: 1, 108436633: 1, 111344408: 1, 112324365: 1, 110232870: 1, 200105749: 1, 109328345: 1, 200101052: 1, 111657384: 1, 200298255: 1, 200340126: 1, 107969579: 0}"
Perfectly Blunt,106200078.0,Sport,106724683.0,5.10d,0.0,1.0,2.4,41.0,"This is the climb that sees the least action of all the lines in this section. Perhaps because its the hardest, or because it is tough to size it up or figure a sequence from the ground. Whatever the reason it sees little love I enjoy it and recommend you take a spin on it, it  will keep you on your toes in many ways.     There are a few distinct sections of climbing that involve unique moves and or follow different features. Start up under the first bolt and climb through a tricky small roof (knee bar) and then mantle to a good stance. Clip the bolt on the left then move right to climb for a bit on the right arete. Now for the face climbing around the fourth bolt you move out across the face out left and stand delicately on thin edges on a very blunt arete (the route's namesake). Climb thin and technical moves to bolt 5 before moving back to the arete out right. Around the corner there is a good hold that is shared with Rack For Sale (5.7), get it, then head up the arete and clip the anchor on the left.     I think it would be a fun link up to climb this route to bolt 4ish then break left in to Technical Second to the top because I love the finish of that route.","{111902978: 4, 107571792: 3, 110712867: 3, 107629960: 3, 112166651: 3, 110062671: 3, 105859360: 3, 107169450: 3, 111350357: 3, 200145579: 3, 112411512: 3, 106103271: 3, 112207022: 3, 106646308: 3, 106134707: 3, 106423391: 3, 200155809: 3, 200454763: 3, 105832216: 2, 111822624: 2, 200159460: 2, 107346586: 2, 200101052: 2, 106486112: 2, 108181716: 2, 105906559: 2, 106125724: 2, 105890157: 2, 105885115: 2, 107630444: 2, 106449525: 2, 108245758: 2, 105963968: 2, 105943577: 2, 106876126: 2, 108290010: 2, 107851075: 2, 108032974: 2, 106108710: 1, 109607011: 1, 111841723: 1}"

Climb 10 feet of moderate climbing to the first roof. Layback past this and get warmed up for the crux. Another roof must be past in much the same way but you will find it very off balance due to not having feet right where you want them. The holds are good so just go for it.

There's probably a more efficient approach here so check out the route and let me know.","{106108233: 4, 110459495: 4, 110580188: 4, 108076264: 4, 106358784: 3, 107571792: 3, 107025924: 3, 105906559: 3, 105886022: 3, 106054402: 3, 107512961: 3, 106103271: 3, 106134707: 3, 106486112: 3, 106125724: 3, 105899248: 3, 106493776: 3, 106751248: 3, 108193208: 3, 107630444: 3, 106360234: 3, 107492957: 3, 106449525: 3, 107688321: 3, 109157864: 3, 108245758: 3, 109337092: 3, 107434457: 3, 110424351: 3, 109371843: 3, 107629960: 3, 106397425: 3, 106523948: 3, 105943577: 3, 106398706: 3, 108652563: 3, 106876126: 3, 111902978: 3, 109102869: 3, 110841071: 3, 108832516: 3, 110231237: 3, 108985245: 3, 109737113: 3, 108032974: 3, 110317485: 3, 111066391: 3, 200101052: 3, 111169936: 3, 112365589: 3, 109607011: 3, 110762698: 3, 109602213: 3, 107169450: 3, 110592577: 3, 110756813: 3, 112166651: 3, 108222002: 3, 107768989: 3, 110712867: 3, 200129067: 3, 200340126: 3, 107852661: 3, 200265615: 3, 200145579: 3, 105832216: 3, 112207022: 3, 200437830: 3, 200840998: 3, 106702886: 2, 105933166: 2, 105898385: 2, 106075659: 2, 106271741: 2, 106347294: 2, 106344939: 2, 105963968: 2, 105885115: 2, 105890157: 2, 107898897: 2, 107257835: 2, 107617264: 2, 106417094: 2, 107739229: 2, 109269951: 2, 105859360: 2, 106538248: 2, 106662131: 2, 108436633: 2, 106423391: 2, 106897206: 2, 110232870: 2, 108181716: 2, 110750765: 2, 111142184: 2, 111181604: 2, 200159460: 2, 109634899: 2, 200281875: 2, 110739544: 2, 7128541: 2, 112042073: 2, 110591893: 2, 106646308: 2, 107346586: 2, 200354948: 2, 106096336: 1, 105961696: 1, 108087249: 1, 108167720: 1, 107851075: 1, 111928487: 1, 111841723: 1, 200416944: 1}"

I'll give it an R rating for the hollow flake but if you can climb gently and place gear in the right spots you should be fine.

Stay to the left of the bolts and you will find secure climbing at 5.4. To the right of the bolts is a little harder at about 5.6.    One of the great things about Rumney is that folks bolt moderate lines like this so you can get down the basics of lead climbing before you climb something hard for you.

Squall,105955582.0,Sport,105926138.0,5.10c/d,25.0,1.0,2.4,128.0,This climb is at least a letter grade harder for the short climber.   Start out on the ledge right of three easy pieces and get you hands into a nice sharp jug. Make a move and gain some move sharp moves(will be hard for short climbers to make the reach) continue up then move up and left out bigger holds to anchors. Excellent footwork is required for this climb to feel do-able for the shorter climber.   I would not suggest this climb for the 5.10 climber with soft gym hands.,"{106096336: 4, 106449525: 4, 200067404: 4, 112926469: 4, 200381053: 4, 110985244: 4, 107783414: 4, 105832216: 3, 106306579: 3, 105913936: 3, 106876126: 3, 106860562: 3, 106075659: 3, 107512961: 3, 107434457: 3, 106271741: 3, 106103271: 3, 106358364: 3, 106113062: 3, 106386213: 3, 106145409: 3, 106844475: 3, 106590583: 3, 107257835: 3, 108050314: 3, 107630444: 3, 106360234: 3, 107394785: 3, 108193208: 3, 108245758: 3, 108265416: 3, 110262256: 3, 107739229: 3, 107385412: 3, 108463738: 3, 108912469: 3, 108276722: 3, 111876358: 3, 111902978: 3, 110923255: 3, 111796230: 3, 112507024: 3, 111181604: 3, 110762698: 3, 200096929: 3, 200041839: 3, 108364795: 3, 107419765: 3, 108692265: 3, 107346586: 3, 111546553: 3, 110264932: 3, 200640686: 3, 107272204: 2, 105943577: 2, 105906559: 2, 105938601: 2, 105933166: 2, 105898385: 2, 106125724: 2, 106134707: 2, 106358784: 2, 105963968: 2, 106486112: 2, 105890157: 2, 106397425: 2, 107969579: 2, 107555169: 2, 108181716: 2, 107377680: 2, 106868421: 2, 106054402: 2, 108062894: 2, 106538248: 2, 109101477: 2, 108223598: 2, 108652563: 2, 106967283: 2, 108266600: 2, 107803888: 2, 105859360: 2, 106417094: 2, 109959108: 2, 108222002: 2, 108245344: 2, 106897206: 2, 109711410: 2, 111900208: 2, 107929356: 2, 108200547: 2, 200051409: 2, 111277314: 2, 108290010: 2, 105875389: 2, 111278312: 2, 108693865: 2, 111879219: 2, 112134112: 2, 111344408: 2, 107116940: 2, 111657384: 2, 109157864: 2, 106720416: 2, 200101052: 2, 109328345: 2, 200074903: 2, 200374248: 2, 108943993: 2, 200272563: 2, 112042073: 2, 107632424: 2, 107723439: 2, 111844655: 2, 200121608: 2, 200463147: 2, 105839151: 1, 106561728: 1, 107851075: 1, 106108710: 1, 107492957: 1, 107639861: 1, 107059069: 1, 110340063: 1, 108032974: 1, 113437089: 1, 200296165: 1, 111841723: 1, 200281875: 1}"

Climb up ledges that provide weird mantel-ish moves. Grab some decent face holds. Continue up face to anchors using some horizontal cracks and face holds. Note- there are a couple well chocked in blocks that moves if you grab them. You don't need to use them and they have been like that for 20 years - no need to chalk them up with 'X's or break them up. Good practice for rocky and unstable relationships!

China Beach is the ultimate sport climb and is the standard against which all other sport climbs should be judged. It climbs up the center of one of the steepest walls in Rumney and it offers no rests after the first bolt. It contains hard moves, but not so hard that it could be considered  a ""boulderer's route,"" like so many other hard routes at Rumney. It requires a top level of both power and endurance for the send.

No one is in line to downgrade the Beach, that's for sure.     China Beach begins with a few moves to get established before the hanging corner. This corner overhangs at about 45 degrees and forces the climber into desperate, insecure layback moves, similar to moves you might find on a trad route. You are more likely to fall due to a foot skating than from strength failure. Yet, it's still taxing. This sections ends at a horizontal about two-thirds of the way up. Dan Nguyen initially redpointed this section at about 13b or c.     The horizontal doesn't offer much in the way of rest, and the next section is the crux which consists of long moves to crimps and difficult foot moves. To call this crux V8 is to discount the previous climbing up the corner. Off the dog, it feels V8ish, but on redpoint it feels unratable. Pumpy, big moves follow up the headwall and culminate in a strenuous iron-cross move left to a pretty big hold. Matching the hold is the redpoint crux, and many a valiant attempt has ended here.    China Beach has captivated climbers for many years and it is common to see people climbing on it just for the fun of it. Big falls are expected. A redpoint to the break is a worthy objective as well.

The draw at the lip is hard to clip; many people forego it on redpoint. Rock over onto a mini hanging slab and rest up for the headwall. From here, amazing 5.12a climbing continues to the anchors. This upper part of Cote d'Azure has been called the best 5.12 at Rumney. Unfortunately for some, this climbing is guarded by the tough, bouldery climbing on the lower wall.     It is somewhat understandable, though not forgivable, that a rock was glued on in order to ""enhance"" one of the crux holds. This made the route a more crowd pleasing 5.12d. However, the climb was quickly returned to its natural state and now rarely gets sent.    (Edit - The enhancement was a random rock glued on to a flat section, not on another hold. It was done by the original bolter, and not by Steve, who later freed the route without using it. The rock was then removed.

There is no protection, but once you go into the tunnel it would be very hard to fall anywhere.   A bit more like climbing is to not tunnel back, but stay near the lip . That goes at about 5.3. A TR or solo head recommended. A bit contrived, but very nice climbing is to layback up the slab using the arete. That goes at maybe 5.7 and a TR is very recommended as it is smearing with rounded handholds.    After visiting family in Bavaria for the Summer, Hermann wanted to show off his new found alpine skills, so got his brother to run up to Waimea with him. After relieving himself and while buttoning up his new fashionable knickers, Heinrich decided to get the better of him and leapt on to his shoulders  and up the climb.

Many very solid climbers attempted the broken line over a few years before Vasya put in an intense amount of work over the better part of a year and snagged the first ascent of what is likely the hardest route east of the Rockies. He was shy about grading it since he had not yet climbed 5.14d but many strong climbers had speculated that it could be 5.15a so that was what it was given tentatively. To date, Jaws II has seen 5 ascents that I know of and the 5.15 grade seems to be sticking. It seems that being local is helpful for projecting    jaws due to the fact that this climb is very conditions dependent and our weather is very unpredictable.    There are two very hard cruxes, the lower one being in the v12/v13 range and the upper one being a huge v10/v11 dead point. There is no real rest on the route unless you count the v6 section in the middle which must feel nice after the intensity of the first crux but I'm sure leaves something to be desired.

Work the feet as you use pinches, underclings, crimps, and awkward feet to make your way up to the final corner where you can wedge yourself in and get a quick rest before doing a few, super-tech moves to the finishing jugs.","{105906559: 4, 110739544: 4, 110262051: 4, 106876126: 4, 109807017: 4, 108226496: 4, 107141348: 4, 106901918: 4, 106327234: 4, 105885115: 3, 12525: 3, 111181604: 3, 106012330: 3, 107102487: 3, 112810997: 3, 109467833: 3, 105941791: 3, 108245758: 3, 10610: 3, 106646308: 3, 111488411: 2}"

From the jug, traverse out left to the big chimney (difficult) to gain a massive kneebar (pad recommended). Through some trickery, remove the kneebar and do a couple of moves to gain a seemingly enhanced undercling with your left hand. Do a reachy move to a mono slot/crimp (crux) with your right hand and clip. Cross over left hand to slot above mono and go up to a series of crimps/gastons/sidepulls. Do one more massive move to a jug crimp to clip the last draw then do one more moderate boulder problem, reaching out left to a corner and one more jump to the anchor jug. This thing is solid in the grade and I think is harder than the more popular 13d's at Waimea. Essentially a long V10 boulder from the kneebar.",{106108710: 2}

Most climbers find groveling in a tight chimney to be a less than preferable way to spend their time but some like myself find it to be part of being an all around climber and it can actually be fun and almost always exciting. Now I will be honest that That Crack is not the best climb of its kind but it is definitely worth while to those who appreciate such climbing styles.  Start to the left of Waimea (5.10d) under the arete of Livin Astro (5.14c) follow cracks until it is possible to wedge in to the narrow chimney (I found left side in to be preferable) and work slowly up placing gear in the crack in the back of the chimney. There is a tricky spot exiting the chimney as it narrows back down from chimney to crack size. Work up to under-clings and out right to the anchors.  As I lowered off I was surprised at how steep the route is. Next to Livin Astro it looks vertical but it's not.

Stick clip the first bolt and crank hard to get on the wall. Shorter climbers might have to jump for the first hold.

Be very aware of this fact when you're clipping in the crux, and make sure not to blow the clip. ","{106928886: 4, 106716166: 4, 106590583: 4, 107628457: 4, 12345: 4, 105876485: 4, 105832216: 4,

Whip Tide,105868994.0,Sport,105867832.0,5.12b,75.0,1.0,3.8,97.0,"Whip Tide climbs up the central inside corner of the cliff. However, this corner is guarded by a bouldery overhang at the bottom and a giant roof at the top. The pump crux, topping out, has given many a climber trouble, but grabbing the chains is a definite faux pas.     Climb up the ladder to the ledge. Whip Tide is the farthest left route starting off the ledge. Stems and the sneaky use of an undercling allow establishment in the corner. From here, relatively moderate, but spicy stemming leads to the roof. Fear not, as the roof holds are some of the biggest in Rumney. Traverse right across the roof and top out.     Originally graded 5.12c, the crux of the route involved a very powerful cross through from a gaston in order to enter the corner.

Start on moderate moves, maybe 5.9ish to a good stance beneath the crux wall. About 25 feet of hard tricky sequency climbing is between you and your next rest. This is where it looked like things may have broken off. I did find a Sequence of crimps that got me through the first 20 feet of the crux but I did some crazy moves to make the last 5 feet and that is where i felt it was more ""12a""ish to gain the ledge above. The next part is maybe 5.10a to another ledge and you think you are in the clear until you pull over what you think is the top and see you have about 15 feet of 5.10 slab to the anchors (cue the rope drag). Stay cool and try not to blow all your hard work as you slowly make your way to the anchor.","{108245758: 3, 105906559: 2, 105885115: 2}"

Follow the crack out right below the roof, not too bad once you get in to it, but it can be pumpy, so get through it quickly if you can in good style.

Just a few hard, footy moves get you to good holds and one final mantel move to the summit.

Pitch 1: 5.7 this is not really part of Hotter Than Hell, but it is the normal start. On the left end of the south buttress locate a slab (""Cathonian Slab"" ) with 2 bolts on it. Climb the slab past the bolts (the climb "" Brimstone"" variously rated between 5.5 and 5.7) to the tree ledge where the route actually starts.  Alternately, hike steeply up to the left of this slab, then make a move back right (beware pine needles and leaves !) to gain the ledge at the top of the Cathonian Slab and walk right to below the start.  Pitch 2: 5.9 start under a couple small roofs, you will see a bolt above. Climb through the overlaps and clip the bolt. Make a spicy traverse right to gain your next bolt then head up the killer crimpy face climbing following the bolts. The crux is a mantel move in to an obvious niche 2/3 of the way up, the move is protected by a bolt. This was once a popular place to belay, but most parties climbing with a 60m rope will prefer to continue out of the niche and straight up to the tree belay at the ledge. And that's the end of the line.  I highly recommend finishing up Inferno (5.8). This is one of the best link ups in the Conway area.

Above a second bolt, make some hard moves (5.10d) to a horizontal ledge and step left to a shared belay on Inferno. 2) Step back right and face climb straight up past a piton and and a bolt (5.10d) to a good stance and a second bolt. Make another hard 5.10 move straight up past the bolt or step right a few feet to an easier finish on  easier ground (5.8).

The true beginning is fun but a little wandering, not following a distinct feature. We will start from there though.     Pitch 0: Scramble on to the ledge below Atlantis.  Scramble right then back left till you are comfortable on the ledge.     Pitch 1: (5.7) Climb up a groove, then on to a flake, and work your way left passing a pin and joining the big corner on the left for a few feet. Follow the crack to belay near a small tree. 130 FT.     Pitch 2: (5.4) Scramble left to gain a big tree ledge and walk along the ledge till you are under a beautiful crack system. Belay from here.     Pitch 3: (5.8) Follow a flake up past small tree until you can move left to a perfect crack. Jam this awesome crack to a belay ledge with a small tree. This crack is one of the best at the grade in the White Mountains. 100 ft.

Once up the hill a ways belay for the first pitch near a birch tree next to a large boulder/clifflet.    Pitch One: climb straight up on moderate terrain past two bolt to a small roof/overlap.  Find a hidden pin above the overlap and mantle at 5.9+. Follow a bolt and gear placements to a tree ledge and belay off any number of trees.    Pitch Two: Above the treeledge there is a steep featured slab with a horizontal crack running through it. Follow two bolts on sustained 5.10 climbing to the horizontal, plug gear and move up past a bolt and a pin to the next tree ledge, belay at trees.    Pitch Three: Above this tree ledge is a Large roof that spans the entire left side of the cliff, there are two bolt lines, the one on the right is Fiddler on the Roof (5.10d) and the left hand route is Jacobs Ladder.  For Jacobs Ladder you want to climb a moderate crack system to the left of the bolts for Fiddler, once established on a ledge system follow a line of bolts up and on nicely sustained 5.10+ face and slab climbing to a two bolt anchor below the left side of the roof.    Pitch four: Move Left from the bolted belay and swing around the roof on moderate to easy face climbing to reach bolts and a rest before the headwall. At the third bolt move right on delicate smears and balance moves, clip your last bolt and make hard moves to the top of the cliff and a two bolt anchor.    Note: The last two pitches can be combined with double ropes or a lot of slings, this makes for a very special experience on the south buttress and wonderful exposure.

START: For the original first pitch of Lost Souls, start at the same gearing-up spot used for Atlantis, Inferno, Last Unicorn, etc. Instead of scrambling up the long 3rd class section that accesses those routes, look for a ledge with several trees about 30 feet up and right from the start of scrambling. The first bolt of the Lost Souls can be seen from the ground, on a slab about ten feet above the tree ledge. Scramble up to the tree ledge and set the first belay.

Zig right and then left to surmount the headwall, and continue up a slab past several fixed pitons, eventually reaching a bolt belay below the big headwall pitch of Lost Souls.

(A couple of NOTEs added by RHall Oct 2019 the day after climbing the route for 4th or 5th time.)  1) scramble to the pine tree at the end of the first pitch of Beginners Route.  2) The Wheat Thin Arete 5.6, 190. Step right of the tree 10 and head up toward a bolt. Climb past a horizontal to join a thin flake. Follow the flake to an arête on the right, passing 3 more bolts to a two bolt anchor.  3) The Cajun Washboard 5.6, 170.

Climb a bulge off the belay into an open book. Pass one bolt before reaching the top of the book. Protect and climb rightward through a green licheny area. Climb a short flake and hand crack up to a tree with an anchor.   Not the best way for two ropes to pass each other, but the photo does show the  critical ""climb rightward through [the] green licheny area. ""  The ledge at the tree is large and it would have been much better for ""rope2"" to have passed there.  [One way to speed up the passage is for rope1's second to leave the gear, rope 2's leader clips into it (and adds additional placements if he/she wishes) and rope2's second cleans and hands leader#1 their gear. This saves the cumulative time of rope1's second removing gear, plus the time of rope2's leader placing the gear. Of course, this has to be OK with all invovled. Communicate ! ]   5) The Northwest Passage 5.5, 60. Step up and left off the belay into a giant, steep flake. Trend up back right above the flake passing a small tree to a larger tree below a bulge with a horizontal.  (RH NOTE: Alternate, easier route to right, which is actually where ""Beginner's Easy"" climbs through the feature, see photo)   6) The Low Beer Light Pitch 5.4, 180. Use the horizontal to clear the bulge. Trend slightly rightward avoiding a dirty water groove to the left. Step back left to a tree belay. (RHNote: Gear is pretty spotty on this pitch. However, there is good gear near the top of the pitch. Look for the obvious, brownish-rock open book,  in the crack near the top of this (but not the flared bottom) a good cam (0.5 or 0.75) can be placed. Easiest route is to the right of the placement.)      7) The Platinum Slab 5.5, 190. Follow a bulgy groove (pitch's 'crux')  passing a white pine tree to your left, then up to an old ¼ bolt bolt and a new 3/8 bolt. Trend up and left passing a faint dike aiming for a white slab and another bolt. Belay at pine tree, with rap anchor. (RH Note: Chris says  a ""190ft / 60m makes it"" , but maybe only if you don't sling the white pine tree about 30 ft above the belay.  Possible, alternate belay at the new bolt  that is 5 ft above the ancient bolt.)   8) The Top Out Pitch 5.3, 60. Climb easy rock straight up to the top.  NOTE the bold text, some climbers climb off route in these areas. If you head straight up from the Open Book, you'll find jungle land. Likewise, if you head straight up from the belay at the end of that pitch, you'll also find jungle land (and an easier variation). If you veer off route in these areas, climbing is feasible at a moderate grade, expect some shwacking!  Pitches 1-4 have fixed rappel stations and are set for rappel with two 60 M ropes.

It would suck if somebody knocked those down with a party below, so we cleaned them off. Two pins were put in downward-facing flakes, one felt solid but one fell out when I merely touched it. The pin itself didn't seem too corroded so the intact one is probably still good.

Start from the launch pad.    Pitch one (5.2): Moves up toward the arch of standard route breaking left to a two ringbolt anchor, even with the bottom of the arch.    Pitch two (5.7): Move right and up past two bolts along a steep ramp. Belay on small gear in a crack with an old pin, or traverse left to a two bolt anchor on Interloper.    Pitch three (5.5): The mental crux for most.   Straight up and a little right climbing past 1 bolt on this 100ft pitch to a 2 bolt anchor at some large solution pockets. The climbing is moderate but feels harder due to the smooth rock and long runout.    P 2 and P3 can be combined with a 70m rope.     Pitch 4 (5.5): move right to a pretty left facing corner with a nice crack, up this to gain a dike and shortly after, a comfortable stance at a slanting corner. Belay from here with gear, lower is better. (see photo ""P4 Belay"")     Pitch 5 (5.6): A couple ways to do this one. You can move up and right across smooth slab over an overlap to a slippery dike or stay left of the dike in a good grove then traversing right to the last few feet of the dike. Either way you do it you are heading for a two bolt anchor below the dike that splits the steep headwall. The direct dike is a bit spooky but more fun in my opinion where as the left option is better protected, easier, but harder to see the line.    Pitch 6 (5.5): Steep but moderate climbing gets you up the 20ft headwall and on to the truly moderate climbing.. Up the easy dike to a good stance. belay from gear.    Pitch 7 (5.3): Up dikes and left over a slab to a tree belay.    Pitches 8 and 9 (5.1 ish): I normally simulclimb them clipping the one bolt between the tree and the summit.Follow the dike or choose your own adventure.Belay from trees above, or stop to belay from 1 bolt at the halfway mark.","{106441684: 4, 106726952: 4, 106586290: 4, 106494505: 4, 107323239: 4, 105906559: 4, 105888978: 4, 10610: 4, 14723: 4, 105831725: 4, 106306579: 4, 105885105: 4, 106542092: 4, 106168303: 4, 106247496: 4, 105922881: 4, 106125724: 4, 106134707: 4, 106573919: 4, 105788964: 4, 106780889: 4, 105963968: 4, 106803769: 4, 106263368: 4, 105889415: 4, 107167101: 4, 106678944: 4, 106358364: 4, 107056240: 4, 107323581: 4, 106741672: 4, 106928886: 4, 108293163: 4, 106720416: 4, 106917666: 4, 105960937: 4, 106588555: 4, 105886625: 4, 106580951: 4, 108310475: 4, 107555213: 4, 107548227: 4, 108685848: 4, 107745631: 4, 107346586: 4, 110317485: 4, 105890911: 4, 109490709: 4, 106990659: 4, 106736701: 4, 106486112: 4, 110930259: 4, 110956309: 4, 106095990: 4, 109638995: 4, 106868421: 4, 108222002: 4, 110152422: 4, 106538248: 4, 105892598: 4, 109411750: 4, 108100269: 4, 200067404: 4, 107201572: 4, 200105825: 4, 112261455: 4, 112375922: 4, 110315255: 4, 200063563: 4, 200187164: 4, 112166651: 4, 200184428: 4, 200277103: 4, 112038160: 4, 200150635: 4, 110756813: 4, 112134112: 4, 107671020: 4, 110580607: 4, 107459332: 4, 200350797: 4, 109057647: 4, 106863637: 4, 200406385: 4, 200074424: 4, 200368837: 4, 106716166: 3, 105927660: 3, 105930639: 3, 106871882: 3, 10186: 3, 106300559: 3, 106074233: 3, 105945019: 3, 106588964: 3, 105801390: 3, 106852549: 3, 106670299: 3, 106718061: 3, 11926: 3, 106412174: 3, 106579529: 3, 107518458: 3, 108355208: 3, 106407009: 3, 107262433: 3, 108310535: 3, 109639678: 3, 108252197: 3, 106210225: 3, 107942262: 3, 106297607: 3, 107324126: 3, 106146571: 3, 106193141: 3, 107494185: 3, 107737400: 3, 111066391: 3, 109023010: 3, 111426811: 3, 200089505: 3, 111808544: 3, 107146835: 3, 112050276: 3, 106440310: 3, 200118970: 3, 108008683: 3, 112207022: 3, 110813958: 3, 110679645: 3, 110336734: 3, 106967283: 3, 107552617: 3, 110979420: 3, 110739544: 3, 109414386: 3, 111882861: 3, 200423818: 3, 109130361: 3, 111737693: 3, 111278312: 3, 110327172: 3, 200384668: 3, 107400819: 2, 107322165: 2, 106916096: 2, 106647777: 2, 109448507: 2, 107699335: 2, 112102872: 2, 200298255: 2, 200171228: 2, 106430658: 1}"

P2: Trend up and right through a small 1' overlap and shoot for the pockets of vegetation/trees. Some munge. Cannot remember if this pitch had a bolted anchor.  P3: Continue up to the very white flake. Once on top of the flake head left along broken flakes to the big white pine. If I remember correctly it had tat and rap rings on it as of Nov. 2019.  P4: Head right to a bolted anchor w/rings. This is also an anchor on SoH and it right below the fun left facing corner on that route.  P5: Go up and right off the anchor up a small left facing corner. Pro is weird to place in this thing, but is solid. Continue up and right to a two bold anchor with rap rings.

Standard Route,105910131.0,Trad,105909571.0,5.5,1100.0,9.0,3.4,269.0,"Updated and History added by R Hall Sept 2017, with permission of the original submitter.  This route may rival the 3rd Flatiron as the best easy multi pitch climb in the states. Although the climbing is relatively easy, there are huge runouts (30-50ft) and few features.  The description below is the way the route is usually done today. The ""Alternate"" is actually the route of first ascent.  P1 (5.0R 100ft) Scramble up to the Launch Pad.  P2 (5.1R 110ft) Angle up and right past a few flakes and belay at the Toilet Bowl. (This was once filled with dirt and vegetation.)  P3 (5.2R 150ft) Head straight up past two bolts and a flake mid pitch. Belay on a ledge with large crystals.  P4 (5.3R 120ft) Head straight up passing a few cool pockets. (tricams) Belay in the underlapping crack at a thread anchor.  P5 (5.4 130ft) Follow the arching crack, pull the through at an intersecting arch (~60ft) and belay on a ledge. (Lunch Ledge)  P6 (5.5 PG-13 120ft) Head straight right and down a bit, past 2 bolts. (""brown Spot"" and ""boilerplate"", crux), head up left on the arching ramp, [ for a Variation, see Alt P6""] pull through at a crack system and belay on gear.  Variation P6 (5.7 PG 120ft, P4 of Slabs Direct) A better pitch heads up and left, then steps back right past a bolt (crux) and up, to end at the same location as P6. (A full description of this pitch is given in Slabs Direct.)  P7 (5.2R 80ft) Head up and left and belay on a ledge.  P8 (5.2R 120ft) Continue up on a dike passing an overlap, and belay on a ledge.  P9 (5.2R 150ft) More runout in the dike, passing one bolt, to the top.  ""Alternate"" Pitches: Alt P3, 4 and 5 is actually the original route.  ""Alt"" P3 - From the Toilet Bowl, head up and left to the base of the arch. 140 ft 5.3 R  NOTE: I believe the base of the arch can be reached in one 70 meter-long (maybe even 60m??), rope-stretching-maybe-simul-climbing-for-a-bit pitch directly from the Launch Pad with nearly zero protection.  ""Alt"" P4 - Follow the arch up (either layback or climb the face just right) to an awkward gear belay at a small ""step"". 140-150 ft 5.4 Try to avoid the tempation the run P4 and P5 together.  ""Alt"" P5 - Continue up the arch to the Thread anchor (end of P4 above.) 100 ft 5.3-5.4   >>> Follow the arch and up to Lunch Ledge as per P5 on the ""usual"" route.  The following pitches may be the original route, or may be variations.  ""Alt/variation"" P6 - Once on the ramp above the brown spot/boilerplate, follow the ramp only about 1/2 way (30-40 ft, not as far as the 5.5 corner) and make a difficult mantel at an ancient bolt; then up an easy dike to the trees. 5.6R +/- 130+/- ft   Alt P7 - Go up a shallow corner, over an ""almost overlap"" on a steep bit of slab (5.5 +/-) and then climb up on a left diagonal to the far left end of a large overlap, turn its left side and belay in a tree.160 +/-ft 5.5, 5.3R  Alt P8 (& P9) - Step left and join the same final dike as regular P8&9 to the top. Most people simul-climb after clipping the bolt. 250 +/-ft (80meters) 5.2R  Descent: Head to your right across the flat top of the slab, and find a wandering path that quickly (2-3 min.) intercepts the official hiking trail (yellow blazes). Take this down in the direction of Cathedral Ledge (north), passing the hiker's turn off to Cathedral Ledge. Once ""down"" take a right back towards the base. It is possible to rap the route with two ropes, if it starts to rain.  History: In the spring of 1928 Underhill, Towle and Holden climbed to the top of the arch [the Std Route followed the arch until the ""quartz pocket"" variation became standard sometime in the 1990's.]. There they were met with a thunderstorm which forced their retreat down the slabs with one rope (probably 100 or 120 ft long, perhaps as short as 60ft, as was custom for the day) for the three of them. This they succeeded in doing, although at one point Holden had to ""tackle"" Underhill who was ""slip-sliding-away"".  In Oct 1929, feeling thwarted, the ""dynamic duo"" of Underhill and Henderson (most probably the strongest rope team in the western hemisphere at the time) hiked to the top and negotiated their way down to the trees above the ""brown spot / boilerplate"". Here they dropped a rope and left it in place.  The rope was used to ""assist"" (as in ""A-0"") all ascents until Leland Pollock (one of the stronger rock climbers in the northeast) lead the moves free in 1932. [ps Vibram rubber was invented in 1937, and didn't come to the US until after World War II.]  The brown spot/boiler plate was lead without bolts for more than 50 years until well into the 1980's or 90's. (I don't know the exact time the bolts were added.) Prior to the bolts being added, a piton far behind you, and actually lower than the climber, was the only ""protection"". The potential for a 20+ft fall, followed by a 20ft pendulum was very real.","{106720416: 4, 107625137: 4, 107618553: 4, 10185: 4, 106957118: 4, 107434457: 4, 105943577: 4, 106713152: 4, 106616366: 4, 107032446: 4, 106679659: 4, 105941791: 4, 107253738: 4, 107866466: 4, 107255799: 4, 10610: 4, 107256302: 4, 106150571: 4, 106280222: 4, 10146: 4, 106411679: 4, 12237: 4, 106087077: 4, 106125724: 4, 106573919: 4, 106643870: 4, 106469016: 4, 106803769: 4, 106301735: 4, 106778424: 4, 106719962: 4, 106892600: 4, 106670299: 4, 106559188: 4, 107050341: 4, 107097819: 4, 106412174: 4, 107167101: 4, 107200327: 4, 106327852: 4, 106874511: 4, 108082584: 4, 107544240: 4, 108293163: 4, 107740836: 4, 106588555: 4, 106961703: 4, 108188495: 4, 106873076: 4, 108608330: 4, 107723931: 4, 109022464: 4, 107222279: 4, 109206743: 4, 106397425: 4, 108358921: 4, 106545854: 4, 107827568: 4, 109280499: 4, 109675570: 4, 111204267: 4, 110317485: 4, 106917454: 4, 106887229: 4, 109490709: 4, 109136692: 4, 109037119: 4, 111682684: 4, 109023010: 4, 111045477: 4, 111646735: 4, 106990659: 4, 106095990: 4, 106868421: 4, 112062931: 4, 112510132: 4, 107873850: 4, 106554217: 4, 108399413: 4, 112219196: 4, 110974889: 4, 200053426: 4, 107346586: 4, 111657384: 4, 112211778: 4, 200160322: 4, 106440310: 4, 107937329: 4, 200180156: 4, 111871900: 4, 107460666: 4, 106888736: 4, 200101052: 4, 110152422: 4, 112261455: 4, 106586290: 4, 200154262: 4, 109460613: 4, 110813958: 4, 200063563: 4, 200067404: 4, 107671020: 4, 200155803: 4, 112827924: 4, 200358908: 4, 200179659: 4, 200383658: 4, 108106981: 4, 107552617: 4, 112038160: 4, 110580600: 4, 200038144: 4, 200056611: 4, 200140229: 4, 200484351: 4, 200232129: 4, 200214637: 4, 106930624: 4, 200253285: 4, 107532549: 4, 200815206: 4, 111849990: 4, 112042073: 4, 110762698: 4, 111650569: 4, 107691094: 4, 200213938: 4, 109057647: 4, 200379970: 4, 200183967: 4, 111783002: 4, 200254024: 4, 200551938: 4, 107572777: 3, 106726952: 3, 106134707: 3, 106681952: 3, 107635859: 3, 106567319: 3, 107323239: 3, 105906559: 3, 105927660: 3, 105971523: 3, 106019055: 3, 106299993: 3, 107400819: 3, 107026497: 3, 107573329: 3, 105922881: 3, 107889804: 3, 107579039: 3, 106247496: 3, 106426493: 3, 106074233: 3, 105801390: 3, 105945019: 3, 106738844: 3, 106751248: 3, 106577584: 3, 105890157: 3, 106554048: 3, 106741672: 3, 107126711: 3, 106615429: 3, 107430471: 3, 106579529: 3, 107228100: 3, 106897359: 3, 108100735: 3, 106852549: 3, 106360234: 3, 106578430: 3, 108550796: 3, 106407009: 3, 108222002: 3, 105913936: 3, 108154390: 3, 108310475: 3, 106957540: 3, 108245630: 3, 107787060: 3, 106580951: 3, 108187975: 3, 106978809: 3, 109411206: 3, 109498955: 3, 109584993: 3, 108477035: 3, 107494185: 3, 108137876: 3, 109711410: 3, 108228481: 3, 108179333: 3, 109856888: 3, 109581799: 3, 109801048: 3, 107698881: 3, 110619029: 3, 109369258: 3, 109079758: 3, 106297607: 3, 106146571: 3, 111813475: 3, 111300279: 3, 106486112: 3, 108252197: 3, 108181716: 3, 108652563: 3, 109383300: 3, 111882861: 3, 106193141: 3, 108179890: 3, 111796230: 3, 106793247: 3, 108899032: 3, 107737400: 3, 112540224: 3, 106430658: 3, 107120057: 3, 110327172: 3, 109411750: 3, 112207022: 3, 111933951: 3, 109269951: 3, 112172937: 3, 105934900: 3, 200253082: 3, 107354086: 3, 200265615: 3, 109869056: 3, 108943993: 3, 200386524: 3, 110979420: 3, 110915247: 3, 111229703: 3, 111426811: 3, 106571266: 3, 107540375: 3, 200706317: 3, 106342472: 3, 200499255: 3, 200106485: 3, 106168914: 3, 108137766: 3, 200067845: 3, 106967283: 3, 107619437: 2, 106941307: 2, 106886078: 2, 106000626: 2, 107617264: 2, 105892730: 2, 107783937: 2, 108050314: 2, 109108961: 2, 107253706: 2, 110945939: 2, 106210225: 2, 110454932: 2, 111610436: 2, 200296165: 2, 111841723: 2, 110679645: 2, 200423818: 2, 109130361: 2, 200150635: 2, 5717666: 2, 110452119: 2, 106714751: 0}"

The route offers some great slab climbing as well as some low angle face climbing. The route protects well but be ready for a couple of your typical Whitehorse run outs.[Admin's COMMENT 2015 - The first 2-3 pitches described by the original submitter of this route are those described in the old (1996) Handren guide as the alternate start for Wedge. They are further right than the FA route. The description for the FA route is given below these.] P1. From the starting ledge, head up and left to some obvious clumps of bushes. You can belay your partner here or continue up to a two-bolt anchor. If you choose to continue on to the two-bolt anchor, climb up approximately 15ft. until you reach a comfortable stance at a solution pocket. Place a #1 Camalot in the pocket and have your partner take you off belay, as you will need to simo-climb the last 20ft. to the anchor. [Admnin's NOTE: THIS anchor must be on Interloper, as the Wedge dbl bolt anchor is much higher. ]P2. Climb straight up the blank slab passing a two-bolt anchor [the dbl bolt anchor of Wedge, see the ""Alternate"" route description.] and a single protection bolt. When you reach the headwall, clip the old rusty piton and traverse right to a comfortable ledge. You can make a 3-point anchor using the rusty piton, a nut and a small cam.P3. From the anchor, head up the slab and climb the nice lay back crack. At the top of the crack, clip a bolt and make thin moves up and right to gain a nice ledge with a two-bolt anchor. Do not forget to protect your partner on the traverse to the belay ledge.P4. Climb straight up to a large pine tree used to rap the route. If you use the fixed gear on this pitch, be sure to use long runners, as you will generate a lot of rope drag if you dont.Note: Most parties will rap the route from here using the pine tree, P.3 anchor, and Sliding Board belay stations.P5. If you choose to top out, climb up and left of the pine tree to a large ledge. Traverse the ledge until you reach a corner with some old pitons in it. Climb the corner to the tree ledge above.Note: The rock will have a lot of lichen on it so be very cautious as you climb the corner to the tree ledge.P6. To reach the top, find the path of least resistance keeping in mind that you will want to head up and to the right. Stay roped together and protect yourself and partner by slinging trees and or placing gear as you make you way to the top. It is all scrambling/simo-climbing so take your time and be very cautious, there are lots of LARGE rocks just laying on the slab(s) and it is opfter the rope, not the climber, that may dislodge them!""Route of FA"":P1- START Looking up from the base there are two tree islands left of the base of the Arch. The first tree island is 25 ft left of the bolts of Sliding Board. [These are the first bolts mentioned in the description above.] Wedge starts at the second tree island, about 40+/- ft further left.[Note the FA party climbed directly from the woods up to the bushes & trees in two pitches. (Those were the days of 150 ft-or-shorter-ropes, and sneakers, which were used on the FA.)The more modern way starts from the Launching Pad. Go up and left, passing one bolt in the sea of slab (possible belay) continuing up and left to the 2nd tree island left of Arch. 200+ ft 5.3 RP2- Up the flake, then up the slab to a double bolt anchor. 140 ft 5.5 R, although if you move a bit right, then back left there's a bolt you can clip on the way.P3- Move up and right from the anchor, passing an old bolt. [If you follow this you don't ""climb to the overlap and clip the rusty pin"".] Some chose to belay at the small tree (gear) 70 ft 5.5-5.6[P3 be combined with P2 with a 70m rope, or a ""long"" 60m ; also, P4 may be combined with P3...but not both!]P4- Up the obvious corner systems to the crux (new-ish bolt, up high and left). Above crux, continue up a few more feet, then traverse right to a comfortable ledge and new bolted anchor. Be sure to have the follower(s) protected on the crux. 80-90 ft, 5.6-5.7 P5- Up the inside corner system that is just left of the belay. End at a pine tree with slings. 90 ft 5.6, 5.6+ ? As said above, most will chose to end here and rap (or lower off: it's less than 1/2 a rope length for 60m ropes) back down to the dblt bolt anchor at the end of P5.Another alternative is to move right and join Sliding Board (if it isn't too crowded) at the end of its usual 3rd or 4th pitch:To join Sliding Board, from the bolted belay at the end of P4 move up and right gaining the base of the large overlap.

I climbed a couple of feet Left of the bolt on smoothed flakes (sort of dike like) and felt it 5.7+ / 5.8-. Partner went up the slab, basically directly over the bolt (5.8 / 5.8+?) or there may be an easier way several feet further right, then stepping back left to clip the higher bolt. We both felt this is the crux of the climb. A good place to use that quickdraw you have with two locking biners on it. Continue to anchor.  100 ft  5.7+/5.8     P3 - Up easy slab, through gap in bushes to another easy slab, step off top onto dirt (bolt ! , photo) to anchor.  85 ft  5.3-5.4    P4 - Up easy slab above, staying slightly right, then more right towards trees. Pass by a double bolt anchor [ optional belay, but anchor is predominantly for the rap line ] and continue another 30-35 ft right and up onto the ""beautiful slab.""  140 ft  5.3 - 5.4     P5 -  (Variations 5a & 5b, There are three ways to do the 5th pitch) From the double bolt anchor at the base of the slab climb directly up passing a jutting, Right-facing flake [photo] (with bush just to the right) then onto the steeper, smooth slab above (bolt). Up the slab passing 2 bolts to a Left-facing flake (gear) and on to the anchor.  Upper slab is very continuous 5.6  120 ft  5.6+     P5a - (""Rain in In"" 5.8+ see COMMENT) From the dbl bolt anchor at the base of the slab, step 5-10 ft right and climb up sparsly-placed bolts (easier climbing slightly right), reaching a bolt 5-10 feet right of the bush mentioned in P5. Now follow bolts up the even steeper and smoother slab about 5-10 ft right of the line of P5.  120 ft  5.8    P5b - (""Sea of Bowls"" see COMMENT 5.7, and goes to its own anchor below the headwall)  From the dbl bolt anchor at the base of the slab, step 15-20 ft right and climb up via a quartz dike in pegmitite-type rock. Continue up easily to the start of the upper slab.  Climb the clean, white-ish slab about 10 ft right of the line of P5a.  To leave ""Sea of Bowls"" and return to DLM move left when you see the DLM anchor.   120 ft  5.6 - 5.7    P6 - From the anchor at the end of the 5th pitch, continue up the slab (bolts) to the headwall with 3 closely spaced bolts. Up this (5.7, considered the crux by FA party) and then walk 20 ft left in the woods to a double bolt anchor on a huge block.  125 ft, 5.7  See also COMMENTs about possible alternative headwall ending to the left of the bolted line.  Descent -  Rap the route, can be done with a single 70m, possibly with a single 60m with one or two creative raps (most notably the rap down P5 would probably have to be split using the tree on climber's left (viewer's right) about half way up the pitch; and the very first rap might leave you a foot or two short of the top-of-P5 anchor; so perhaps(?) use a tree instead of the top-most 2 bolt anchor(?)","{106873076: 4, 108310475: 3, 108179333: 3, 110679645: 3, 109163800: 3, 106191055: 3, 106917454: 3, 106095990: 3, 200213938: 2, 111968804: 2, 109230273: 2, 106726952: 2, 109460613: 2, 108137766: 2}"

Alpine Experience - A link Up & New(?) Finish,119495259.0,Trad,112006079.0,5.7,900.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,"NOTE- The the first 3 bolted belays have been removed from this this climb to revert it back to a more Alpine Experience which is in keeping with the ethics of the crag. This was a mutual agreement. It's a nice line that utilizes some of the best parts of existing routes and climbs a fairly direct line up the slab headed for the clean, gray rock about 30-40 feet the left of Orgasmo Slab. The last 2 1/2 pitches are believed to be new (see History) Moderate climbing, reasonably protected cruxes.P1 – Climb the first pitch of October Sundae 125-130 ft,  5.6-5.7  (Bolt placed with permission of FA leader, but may be removed. Either he forgot the discussion, or changed his mind. ) NOTE: Check the belay tree at the top of the pitch it seems dead; but was “backed up” to another tree in Nov 2020.   P2 – Climb the 2nd pitch of October Sundae and then climb through a notch in the right side of the overhang. Build a gear belay at a good flake about 20-25 ft up and left of the top of the notch..  135-150 ft,  5.3 - 5.4  The bolted anchor directly below notch in the OH has been removed.  RH & RW climbed the notch Aug 20, 2020, but others before us (see COMMENT)P3 – Leaving the line of October Sundae (which traverses left, a bit BELOW the level of the gear belay, to the fabulous jam crack pitch) Climb up the clean, grey rock into the wide, central depression of the slab.  Step over a small overlap and continue up the depression. Gear belay in a wide crack (#1 to #2's) or move up and left another 25+/- feet to the bolted belay/anchor of the 3rd pitch of October Sunday . 150-180 Ft 5.4 +/-  The climb ""Ingy's Ice Cream"" joins this pitch about 1/2 to 3/4 of the way up it. P4 - Move right and climb the obvious quartz dike, following Ingy’s Ice Cream.  (Gear: finger-thick cam(s) down low, see photo.) Above the dike, continue up on easy terrain. About 30 ft. above the dike Ingy’s branches off left headed for a big white slab, [photo] Continue up straight, make a move past a bolt (above the bolt a dbl bolt anchor may still remain to the right, take it if it’s there) and head for a 15-20 ft high right-facing flake/corner. Up this, stepping left (bolt still in? ) then back right and up to a bush-island. Gear belay at the right end of the sandy ledge forming the island.  160 - 200? ft  5.6-5.7  Note: Crack is good, but may require two of the same sized cams..I think green (0.75 fit)   P5 – Starting at the left end of the sandy ledge (gear) climb the slab ( ? passing a bolt, still in ?), then up some nice cracks. [see NOTE about Orgasmo] As of Nov 2020 there was a double bolt anchor up and right from the top of the cracks. If it’s still there take it and combine the next 30 ft with P6 as described below.   If the anchor has been removed...continue up on easy terrain that is roughly 15 ft right of a tree island (see photo) You'll pass over some yellow-rock ""holes"" and pass a 1ft pancake-like flake (natural thread, 8mm left in, might be cleaned). Now step left, over the rib, and one step down to the sandy ledge of the tree island. As of Nov 2020 there was a bolt about 15 ft up. Either belay of the scraggly trees, or climb up to the bolt, clip it and lower back to the ledge. Tie off and belay. 170-190 ft 5.4-5.5.  A bolt at the level of the ledge would be really nice.   NOTE: If you want to get to the superb pitch of Orgasmo Slab move 40-50 feet down and right from the top of the slab, before the cracks. This will get you to the belay/rap anchor on that climb. If the dbl bolt anchor mentioned in P5 is still “in”, the BEST of “Orgasmo Slab” can be climbed by simply moving right 20-25 ft and climb up to the first of the 3 protection bolts of that climb! P6 –  From the left end of the ledge (re)-climb up the clean slab (to the bolt, still in? ) into the shallow corner with a small overlap on its left.  Up the corner (gear above the overlap), passing a second bolt ( still in?). then move right up to a dbl bolt-chain anchor (??) about 10 ft below the trees. or up to the trees if the anchor has been removed.  80  ft 5.6-5.7  Descend: Options:1) If the top anchor and the anchors mentioned as being in the middle of pitches 4 and 5 are still in place, then rap down these (a single 70m will make these) to the anchor at the top of P3 of October Sundae (the anchor 25-30 ft left of the quartz dike) Then down Oct Sunday with double 60m ropes. The rap from this anchor takes you over the overhang. At the OH aim for the fallen birch tree on the ledge below you (I.e keep left) and you will avoid the sharp edges of the OH. Do NOT aim for the dbl bolt anchor below the OH ( on the “direct” variation). This is where the sharp edge is.2) If the anchors have been removed, walk about 100 +/- ft left to the top anchor of Oct Sunday. Rap that line with double 60m ropes. ( 5 raps) History – In 2016 the original birch tree on the Oct. Sundae rap line departed the mountain (almost with RH “aboard”) and almost simultaneously reports were posted that the edge of the overhang had damaged rope(s) while rapping over it.  A rap line that avoided the overhang’s edge was established going through a notch on the right side.  By chance, these two anchors were set 33-34 meters apart. On Aug 20, 2020 RH &RW placed anchors up to the level of the now-middle of P5.   On Sept 1, 2020 they returned and put in P6, and added a couple of “don’t die on this route” protection bolts (the bolt on P 4 and 5.)Climbers that frequented this crag, including the most prolific FA-er of October Sundae, expressed dismay that the climb, with its anchors, was not in character with the alpine nature of the crag and the routes. After discussions it was agreed that the ""alpine"" nature of the crag should remain and the anchors would be removed.  In early Nov 2020 the lower three rap anchors were removed by the team that put them in. These were the 3 anchors that led down from just below the quartz dike through the notch on the right side of the overhang. For climbers ascending there are locations for gear anchors. The lower two of these anchors were located on, or close to, October Sundae; the 3rd on lngy’s Ice Cream.At this writing (Nov 2020)  the 4 protection bolts and two anchors ( plus the very top anchors) on the “Alpine Experience” variation above where the route branches off from  Ingy’s Ice Cream remain in place. ","{108310475: 3, 110679645: 3, 108148696: 3}"
Call of the Wild,112182267.0,Trad,112006079.0,5.8,0.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,"A route not to be missed on the right side of the main slab, up high. If it was cleaned up it would be 4 stars! A good variety of interesting slabs and big steep headwalls with amazing moves. This route was originally rated 5.7 but I put it up as 5.8 as it’s a grade harder than other 5.7s on this cliff.    P1. Start up the dirty lichen filled featured slab (around 5.6) with some tricky moves. There’s not much pro and not too much clean rock. Be careful and don’t give up, it gets much better! When you reach the head wall, surmount it on the far left side. It’s tricky, but with decent gear and little better rock. The moves up here are so much fun. It’s eases up after that with some flakes and smaller overlaps to a two bolt anchor, which you will not see until basically upon it. A 60m is just about to reach fully stretched. If you’re not sure, build a temporary gear anchor right after the head wall at a small ledge. 200’ 5.8    P2. This pitch starts up a clean fun featured slab. So much nicer than the first pitch’s slab section. When you get to the big headwall, veer left and go up on the far left here too, pretty much right under a small tree little higher up. Climb up and right over the arête with amazing fun moves to a small ledge and gear anchor. 170’ 5.7    P3. Last pitch is straight up over easier terrain with featured slab.

October Sundae,112048756.0,Trad,112006079.0,5.7,0.0,7.0,3.1,15.0,"A fantastic moderate route to the top of the cliff with great variety. Mostly 5.2-5.4 climbing with a few moves a grade or two harder spread out. Lots of options. You could probably do the route 3 or 4 times and never do it exactly the same.P1. Climb the slab [photo] to the tree ledge. The moves on the white rock are the crux of the climb, probably by 2 grades, and now has one bolt (placed with permission of the FA leader)  protecting the thinnest move, and (with a good belayer) preventing groundfall as the thin moves continue at 5.5-5.6 or so before easing off and gaining protection. 120-125 ft  5.7 One can also climb P1 of ""Ingy's Ice Cream"" (the next climb right). It is easier and one can then move back left to ""October"") It is also possible to start on the ""Road North"" and join ""October"" at the end of P2.P2.

This 2nd is for an alternate rap that avoids the OH. Do not belay here as the next pitch would be both too long and too zig-zagging, but continue on 20-30 ft the gear anchor below the right end of the OH. )P3. Climb the right side of the roof and traverse left till you see a slanting, low-angle crack (easy) above a small ledge. Continue traversing and slightly up. You may be able to see the beautiful ""vertical"" crack on a slightly bulging face that you are headed for. Gear belay.If you're going to get lost on this route it will be on this pitch. Be sure to traverse low, well below the tree island that is above the right end of the huge overlap. The easiest route (one semi-exposed 5.4-5.5 move that is more ""spicy"" to follow than to lead!) is just above the ""lip"" of the OH.

End at a two bolt anchor on the slab to the right of a tree island. 110 ft 5.4 - 5.5[The FA party ran P3 & P4 together, but how they did this with a 60m rope I don't know unless there was virtually nothing ""in"" between the middle of the traverse and the top of the crack, thus allowing the rope to run in a long diagonal. I don't even think a 70m would reach.]P5.

[There are two photos of this pitch, each a slightly different variation.] 160-170 ft 5.5-5.6 The FA party did not split the next pitch, but rather led it as one. A 60m rope just barely reaches the top anchor! We will describe it as split into two pitches, P6 & P7. This way results in two good things: one nice for the belayer, the other nice for the leader! If you split the pitch (as it will be described) then there's enough rope for the belayer to stand on the nice, flat, toppled-tree about 8 ft below the bolts (keeping the tie-in at the bolts, of course) and on the last pitch (P7) the leader will not have anywhere near the rope-drag/weight he/she would have in one, long 60m pitch.With the belayer at the flat ledge a-top the toppled tree, you can just barely see the double quicklinks and rope of the top anchor, otherwise it is not visible until you reach it.

Take your choice:* Move up a small corner, step left and then up the face and cracks via the easiest-looking line to the top anchor. ""0.3 and 0.4 Camalots"" very useful. RH & RW did this line, digging out every cam & nut placement so it probably hadn't been done before. 100+/- ft 5.4-5.5 * Climb the slabs a bit to the left, less protection and maybe a bit harder. At the top, move right to the anchor. 110 +/- ft 5.6-5.6October Sundae DirectIf you are interested in a more sustained variation using a more aesthetically direct line this is a nice option (?see topo?):P2. Instead of going to the right of the roof / overhang as described above, go straight up (passing some smaller bushes) to the two bolt anchor, just right of the tree island. 180 ft 5.3-5.4 P3.

At a weakness towards the left end (               October Sundae Direct - Traverse left under the overhang, passing a bolt and surmount the overhang on the left end.      ), do a bouldery move with good gear (easier if you are tall) and surmount the overhang.

The whole tree sits on the ledge with less than 10% of its (rotted) roots in the dirt.

The final pitch, the ""Orgasmo Slab"", is one of the finest friction pitches in the Northeast. (IMO even better than the friction pitch of Sliding Board on Whitehorse.) It was led in fine style by Dustin Cormier who climbed the pitch with only the minimal natural gear. The three 3/8-inch bolts were placed by the FA party later. ( see Comment) Most of the climbing on the route is 5.3 to 5.6, well below the grade of 5.8 given to the last pitch by the Cormiers. I would never argue with a Paul Cormier grade, and hence have left the 5.8 grade in the header for the route.  In any event, all of us felt this G/PG-13 protected pitch was not technically more difficult (and way less psychologically difficult) than the run out, ""5.7"" P1 of October Sundae, and way easier than Paul's ""5.7"" ""Ground Control"" on Mt Willard.The climb could have been named ""Three White Slabs"" as it climbs over white slabs on P2, P4 and P5.P1- START on the grey slab 100 ft right of Oct.

It's pure adventure climbing where you climb a pitch, bushwack through trees, getting to a new section, passing more trees and so on. You have no idea what will come up next! Most of the route is 5.5 terrain with some 5.7 moves on every pitch.Note: The route is rated 5.9 because of the fourth pitch. It does however have a new 5.7 variation, keeping the whole route at that grade!START- From the base of October Sundae bushwack left along the cliff till you get to a nice clean white slab on the far left side of the cliff. At the slab, scramble up on the left edge of the slab to a small dirt ledge. (See Photo of the correct slab to start on) P1. Follow the path of least resistance up the slab with some gear here and there up to a two bolt anchor. 170' 5.6-5.7P2. Here you have two options:* Climb up veering left over over a triangular right facing flake and continue up the slab to the trees. 120' 5.6* Traverse left with delicate moves past the bush to the slab behind and continue up through some fun moves to belay at the trees. 140' 5.6-5.7Move the belay 40 ft past the trees. 40'P3. Climb easier slab to steeper terrain and the headwall with a distinct diagonal crack. Surmount the headwall on the right of the crack for easier moves. For those looking for more interesting moves, use the crack or go left of it. Then continue on easier terrain to the trees. 195' 5.6-5.7Move the belay 50 ft past the trees. 50'P4. You have two options here:* When you get to the trees above, go right through the trees. When looking up you will see a steeper slab with a blue bolt. This is the crux of the route. Climb the slab and then veer right over easier featured terrain to the trees. 190' 5.9* To keep the route at 5.7 you can instead go straight up through the trees and you will see a head wall literally right where the trees end and the start of the pitch. Climb this head wall using underclings and fun moves. Then veer right (and you will see the blue bolt to your right from the 5.9 variation). Continue up and right through easier and featured terrain to the trees. 170' 5.7Move the belay 50 ft past the trees. 50'P5. Here you also have two options:* Climb the really nice slab straight up. Halfway up there's a small pocket for pro, but other wise not much else. Then veer right and traverse right all the way to the October Sundae top anchor. 170' 5.6* If you want more pro and featured terrain you can go up just right of the clean slab and when reaching the top veer right and traverse right all the way to the October Sundae top anchor. 170' 5.5",{106554219: 3}

North Bald Cap, across the way, has it's ""Lost Boys"" area, so we called this ""Two Lost Guys"".     Acting on a recent post to MntPrjct we took gear and a printed copy of posted descriptions, along with some fairly high resolution photos I'd taken from No. Bald Cap a couple of years earlier, and went exploring. Outlook's submitter (Ron Birk) had sent me a link to a photo with routes, but I never clicked on it as I had assumed that the link was to the written descriptions in a public blog. (Yes, pretty dumb of me, eh?!)    After the grind to the top (1200 ft in 1.2 miles to the Outlook Junc.) we had many discussions on ""Where, exactly, is this ""tree island""? (Later I was to conclude it was on the very top of the cliff !)    We did find the double bolted anchor about 100-120 ft down the climber's-left skyline ridge. (photo)  We used this to rap down what you'd call the ""west face"" (190 ft rap, staying to rappeller's left and not dropping right over the overhangs) to a good tree ledge. (According to the photo on ""smug-mug.com"" there's another dbl bolt anchor about 30-40 ft right, and 10-20 ft higher than this ledge. On a 2nd trip to the Outlook we would find this station, see ""Hand Over Hand"")  A solid 5-inch diameter pine provided a 2nd anchor to rap down the ""south face"". We stopped about 150 ft down at a pine tree, about 30-40 ft from what looked to be the base. (Much scrub and many trees would have made for an unpleasant rap of this final 50 ft.)     P1 - Climb back to the pine tree ledge. For us, this pitch included climbing a fairly prominent, 25-30 ft high R-facing corner of more distinctly yellowish rock. (in photo of P1)  150 ft  5.3   Whether this pitch included any of ""Hand Over Hand"" is not known for sure. [Disclaimer: due to the weather, and the rope-mess that would have resulted in pulling the ropes into the trees and bushes, the ""leader"" top-rope soloed this pitch.]     P2 - Step right from the belay pine, then up the white-ish rock via a series of corners, flakes and faces, (photos) arriving at the dbl bolt anchor.  190 ft 5.4-5.5  It is now believed that this pitch is about 25-30 feet climber's left of the top pitch of ""Hand Over Hand"" This was a very nice pitch, and more interesting than it looked when we rapped down it. Whether it had been done before I have no idea. Can't believe it hadn't.     ""P3"" (as per ""Hand Over Hand"") - scramble 100-120 ft to the top trees. Class 3 to 5.0    After this climb we were still confused about where the already-established routes were, so one of us got lowered down 125-140 ft in two places on the main face of the cliff. We could not see any of the dbl bolt anchors that are supposed to be there, but given the mica embedded in the rock, this is perhaps not surprising, or perhaps we did not lower far enough.  (The first of our lowers is now known to have been only about 40-50 ft to climber's right of ""Sweet Success"")     The rock was generally quite climbable, and of a similar nature to the pegmatite section of Pine Mountain. Climbing back up from these ""lower downs"" was generally in the 5.3-5.5 range, including traversing under what had looked like a formidable overhang from our stance at the lower pine tree on ""Two Lost Guys"".

Easier climbing up cracks, underclings, and edges leads to a stance to the right of a small, hunched over birch just below a lighter gold band running straight up the steep headwall. This spot has been called the 'Hollywood and Vine stance'. The climb follows the gold streak up passing a series of suspect bolts and hangers.    Standing up tall with an undercling (or using the edges on the bulge above) will let you clip the first hanger. A short boulder problem gives way to a thank-you jug and your next piece to clip. It's about to get real. Continue up the overhanging face on small crimps and sloping edges, starting on the right side of the bolt line moving up and to the left side. A few decent holds at the bottom of the dark gold spot below the small roof will let you clip the 5th hanger.  Continue right and then up and to the lip, gathering yourself to make the final tough mantle. A jug above the lip, set back and out left, makes this possible. Up on the slabby edge of the cliff is a set of eye bolts. About 15ft above, another set of anchors and an escape to the top of the Rimmon.

Climb up the clean slab past tiny ledges and bushes to The Golden Bench. That a bigger ledge with orange colored rock on the right side. There are some features that may take some gear. 5.2 60-70’   P1. Starts on the left side of The Golden Bench and goes up the left leaning broken right facing corner. It’s mostly easier terrain, but the rock can be slippery here, so take care. When reaching two vertical cracks, go up them (crux) and then go left to tree ledge. 5.6 150’    Pitch 1   P2. Go straight up from the right side of the tree ledge passing a right facing corner, then work yourself left passing a left facing corner (arches left). There are two pins along the way. Continue left over a small drainage to a small tree ledge. 5.6 180’   P3. Continue left passing some lichen and connect with The Wave (another route that comes up the daker slab). There is a bolt and continue straight up (passing another bolt) to a big tree. 5.5 180’   P4. Work yourself diagonally left/up towards a big flake by the trees and continue to a tree belay. Unless you go diagonally in a perfect line, you will not reach the next belay/rappel tree (which is in the trees) with a 60m rope. But no worries, there are trees below you can use when you run out of rope. 5.4 200’    P5. Pass “tunnel” in trees (or start climbing the slab directly before the rap station) and go right along a small ledge with small bushes. At the right side of the ledge there is a vertical runnel with water holes above you. Follow that up to the left side of a tree ledge. Depending where you started on how you went this can also be a rope stretcher. 5.2 180-200’   P6. Go through the “subway” to the right side of the tree ledge. Recommended is to move the belay to this side as otherwise the next pitch will be a rope stretcher too. Belayer will also be able to see the leader. Climb the slab passing some bushes/trees (and ledge) to a steeper section with some leaning cracks. Rock and pro is less optimal here so take care. Get to the tree ledge and the rap station on the left. 5.6 170’   P7. Go straight up over a small bulge. It’s look easier going up further left but leads to less nice rock. Surpass a shorter steeper section of very nice rock that leads to more beautiful slab. Pass a bolt and continue up veering slightly right. High up (on the right) before the next tree ledge there is another bolt. Extend the sling (a lot, as there will be rope drag otherwise). The next belay/rap is in the trees on your left. 5.6 200’   P8. Up easy slab to the next tree ledge. Basiclaly just moving the bealy to a better position for the final pitch on the slab. A 60m rope will also not reach all the way. 5.2 80’   P9. Veer right passing a small ledge with some vegetation and go towards a left facing corner (up and right) and with steeper terrain. Follow corner to the top and tree belay. 5.6 170’    This is a good spot to take a break and gather your gear. For 5.6 leaders and those with less time or are less adventurous, you will now have completed an excellent long slab climb and can start rappelling down from here. For the solid 5.8 leader and those who don’t mind a steeper bushwacking, be sure to keep moving.   Bushwack. To get to the final pitch to the top of the cliff, you follow a faint climbers path that leads right. Follow it as best as you can, passing some small slabs (that you surmount). Basically keep taking the path of least resistance. After not too long, start working yourself left as the route breaks the headwall on the left. The route goes along a left leaning ramp / arête. See pics for what to look for. It shouldn’t take more than 15-20min if going the right way.   P10. The final pitch to the top of the headwall. Start by surmounting a smaller boulder and where the left slanting wall / ramp starts. Climb the ramp on the left. This section is “less than optimal” so take care and keep going. Pass some bushes keep going through less stellar terrain until the arête opens up.  From here it’s stellar climbing along the beautiful arête. At the top of it you can build an optional belay if you get too much rope drag (big gear BD #2-3 useful). Continue up a slab section to the final blocky section. The rock is less good here again, so you may want to go up on the right to the top and tree belay. The pitch is rather sustained so make sure you are comfortable at the grade and alpine terrain. 5.7+ 170’    The final pitch, as seen when approaching it.    Congratulations on finishing a really nice route. Thanks Brady, Mark and Todd for setting up the route! From here you can rappel down or continue to the trail and the Webster summit (via a short but tough bushwack).

Waveland,113416343.0,Trad,111066387.0,5.8,1500.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,"This is a variation to ""Candyland"" that starts on ""The Wave"" for 2 pitches and then stays left and continue up ""Candyland"".   We feel it makes for a much more natural line and doesn't change the grade much.   We did it in 7 + 1 pitches (more on the ""+1"" in a moment).    I would recommend just doing the 7 pitches and then rap off, unless you are ready for adventure in a vertical forest.   It becomes vertical bushwacking mountaineering at its best(worst?)    Pitch 1 - 5.8 200+ feet.   Start on P1 of ""The Wave"".   It is located on the left most side along the slab - you have to hike up left from the base of the slab off of the approach trail to about 60-100 feet or so up in the gully separating Chinos slab from Bore Tide.   If you look hard enough you will see a bolt right on the slab to protect establishing one's self on the slab from the bushes below.  Got up and there is some natural pro to 5 more bolts.   The crux is right at the 5th bolt and is well protected.   6 bolts total 200+ feet to a bolted anchor.   60 meter will ALMOST NOT reach - it's super close!    Pitch 2 - 5.6?   230+ feet.   Start from the bolted anchor and just go straight up the slab following 3 bolts.   It's mostly low angle (5.3?  5.2?) to a single 5.6 move. 60 meter rope WILL NOT reach the tree ledge and we simul-climbed to avoid any shenanigans.       Pitch 3 - the crux is at the start and ends lower angle.   Not much pro but after 5.5 start it's mostly an easy steep hike. 190 feet to a tree ledge and use the tree as the anchor.    Pitch 4 - From the ledge go up and right past the bushiness that is in front of you.   Then go straight up.  Route finding can be tricky here - use the beta pics for reference.  Tricams works on this pitch for pro.   Again pretty run out but super easy.  5.2  170 feet or so.    At the top of the pitch move the belay station about 50 feet to the right through a ""subway"" tunnel.   See the beta photos for reference.    Pitch 5 - there is much route finding here so pay attention.   Go up and right past a bushy ledge to a headwall of sorts - it has diagonal as well as horizontal cracks that is completely vegetated.   I gardened the pro (BD #1 works quite well in a horizontal after cleaning out the dirt) and it leads to a grassy ledge that has an overlap slab.   Go to the middle of that slab and mantle up onto it - it's only like 15-20 feet long and it'll dump you in a gardened grassy ledge at the bottom of a very clean looking slab.   Sling the tree there and belay.   170 feet 5.6.    Pitch 6 - go up the clean slab passing a bolt, then aim for the shallow corner above it and use it for pro and follow it up.  When the corner peters out there should be another bolt.  Exit left to another ledge and belay from a tree.   5.6 2 bolts total 180 feet.    From here there is a ""climber's trail"" that moves the belay up the tree ledge about 80 feet to a clearing for the next pitch.    Pitch 7 - It's lichen-y and bushy and just  not very memorable. 5.6 170 feet. Basically go up and right and through a ledge with bushes, and then up the slab more to a clearing you can spot with a rappel sling tied around a tree that marks the top of the pitch.    ----------------   From here be forwarned that the climb is basically done.   You can rappel from here or if you want to do some adventure climbing/suffering...    300+ feet of bushwack mountaineering awaits.   It starts off well enough on a ""climber's trail"" that's pretty faint that goes up and right.   It ends in a lichen-y broken slab.  The slab heads back left. Going up the slab doesn't instill confidence with the lichen but it's probably the right way and it leads to some ferns and then into some pine trees.   It will deposit you at the left side of the headwalls.       The mythical 8th pitch.   If someone actually climbed it, let me know.   The headwall looks very impressive, but we spot at least 3 ""left leaning ramp"" that seem to fit the description.

A Bit Too Short,111089477.0,Trad,111065739.0,5.7,1000.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,"A Bit Too Short (5.6 / 5.7) climbs the slab between ""Direct"" and ""Dharma Initiative"". It STARTs about 100 ft up-gully of Direct. (See Topo/Photo posted to ""Main Slab"") Kurt Winkler's excellent sketch topo ( I got it from Brad White, thus mis-attributing it for years, sorry Kurt) shows the climb starting about 100 ft above the ""toe"", passing 3 bolts. Sept 2020 I climbed it, starting from the ""toe"" (and mistakenly thinking we were on ""Direct"") and finding four bolts. Starting at the ""toe"" increases the length of ""pitch 1"" (vs starting ""100 ft up the gully"" ), resulting in an ""unorthodox"" belay at the single 3rd bolt.  I guess you are supposed to start ""100 ft up"" and climb at a left-rising diagonal to Bolt #1, or maybe Bolt #2.We arrived at the base (the toe) just as the sun was reaching the face, and the acute angle allowed us to see Bolt #1 and, I think, Bolt #2.  Anyhow, here's is how we did the climb with the unorthodox single-bolt belay about 140 ft up. We actually started from a ledge about 10-15 ft up, but unless you scramble all the way to the first crack, about 30-35 ft up, I really doubt you could make the normal anchors with a 60m (200 ft) rope.  1) [see Photo ""RW at Bolt #1] From the talus at the base, scramble up to a dark crack that is more-or-less in the center of the slab. (Gold, #2 Camalot) Up this, then, passing one bolt, head for a small inside corner just to the right of some vegetation. Don't climb the corner, but step right onto the face below it to a thin crack (gear). Up this to a stance and the 2nd bolt just below a crack/weakness of less-that-stellar rock. (If you are going to break up into 2 pitches, this stance is the best belay.) Up the crack-weakness, then left to the 3rd bolt (we belayed here) Above the 3rd bolt, move left anbd up on grey rock headed for a flake/overlap about 30-35 ft above the 3rd bolt (5.4-5.5 R). Gear in right side of flake, then climb slab past 4th bolt headed for a small patch of vegetation up and right. Move or two at the vegetation, then either a few moves right to dbl bolt anchor at a cramped belay, or a few mnoves left into a ""V"" groove and a gear belay. 5.6-5.6 About 230-250 ft from talus(70-75m)  or two pitches of approx. 130 ft and 110 ft.  2) Up the clean slab past several bolts to a dbl bolt anchor.  150 +/- ft,  5.5-5.6 3) [Photo (s)] Continue up the clean slab, passing over several ledges and occasional crack.  150 +/- ft  5.3-5.4 4) Continue up easily to a dbl bolt anchor. 5.2-5.3 160 ft +/- [From here it is very easy to move the 40-50 ft left to the base of Direct's really great ""White Slab Pitch"", which is what we did. The actual climb continues: P5) Up to a dbl bolt anchor about 10-15 ft right of the anchor on Direct.  P6) Climb over the short ""headwall"" (bolt) and up to a tree with old sling.

Somewhere high up above the left central slabs I located trees that had an exposed inclining ramp.  Ramp ended at a step over the void onto the vertical+ cracked north face. Wedged at the base of it was a large block that would easily pendulum when pushed by my right foot. To no prevail the trundle of this rock didn't happen onto the slabs. The keystone remained. Fearful place, the hoist across upward, makes it one way. Can't stop, its easier than it looks but not what I had meant for me to do. I wanted mellow and got myself into a hell of a mess. Moderately up the cracks over and secure from being trapped above the slabs was a short lived experience. At great risk now, in no where's land. I must have wanted to do such a climb. Why? This one, hundreds of feet (5-5) slabs of trenches and friction climbed. The north wall's holds, were a direct fracture line up to have to keep my shit together. Nowhere goes up on small live twigs of the only available slab wall with foot features of eroded rock edging. Solid enough and after a while, easier climbing near larger plants and trees. Onto the beautiful, thankfully, anticlimactic dome finish. Exhilarated from being far away from the twigs, the dome was a playground of solid hand jamming cracks. The dome begins with steep rock. The length of this climb is the upper half of the climb. Together its around 1200 ft. and that seems ridiculously long. I highly recommend this climb for the epic minded climber. I'd bring some iron for the twig cracks. I would like to repeat it with a rope (if I can find it). There's lots lots of alpine rock to ""have at it"" after the slabs with high exposure.   Just one more thing about this route the 5.5 rating is a joke and I will change it to my usually rating for ascents like these that I done. It could be 5.10 on the dome. After all of the scary crap too get there and then get my hands into solid steep hands jams was delightful.

He has chosen to keep the more common name ""Lost in the Sun"" for the route. His route description is that given above. For those looking for a bit of route finding adventure STOP HERE, others may appreciate the description below, from Ben Townsend:Start: where the drainage gully meets the slab, there are three obvious features -- a wide vertical dike of black volcanic rock on the left, an open left-facing corner with a blank-looking left wall, and an alcove on the right at the base of a reddish vein or weakness that goes up into a short, darkish left-facing corner. This alcove is where you want to start.P1: Up the short left-facing corner, then diagonal up left across a slab to corners, ledges, and an anchor. 115' (we rapped this pitch with a single 70m rope). The neclimbs description says there's a bolt on this pitch, but we saw no sign of one.P2: You'll notice another anchor about 40' up and right -- ignore it, it's the P1 belay of ""Direct"". Instead, start up low-angled corners, then follow a slab* past three bolts to an easy headwall with cracks and a big ledge with two sets of anchors. (The third bolt is oddly located, requiring a stop right in the middle of the crux friction, despite a good stance just down to the right.) *The slab seems to hold its wetness. If so, it's easy to move a bit right and climb to the same ledge via ""Direct"".The left set of anchors has one hanger sheared off by rockfall, though gear placements allow for backing up the other; the right set of anchors (of ""Direct"") has stainless bolts, but rusty plated ring-anchor hangers. A few minutes with a wrench and two stainless ring-anchors would remedy this issue, and if I get back up there this fall, I'll try to remember to do that. (Admin. NOTE: On the left, in addition to the broken bolt hanger, the bolt itself appears is bent. I was unable to remove the nut with a wrench. R. Hall 10-8-15)P3: Up the obvious right-facing corner to a slab with three bolts (two visible from below); trend up right to an anchor.P4: Easy slab to a ledge, then easy left-facing corners to a big ledge and anchor.(NOTE: From this belay an easy ""groove"" leads up and right to the belay on ""Direct"" just below the fabulous ""white slab"" pitch. (P6 of ""Direct"") If the upper pitches of ""Lost"" are wet, this is a good alternative.P5: Up an easy water-streak groove with poor rock, the traverse left below a headwall, cross a gully, and diagonal up left on flakes and cracks to the obvious Snake Flake. Up to its top, then move right to the anchor. Lots of rope drag possible if you don't use long runners wisely.P6: Friction slab past two bolts (a bit heady off the belay to the first bolt, though the climbing is easy), some thoughtful gear placements in pockets or flakes on the slab, two more bolts (the third is hard to see until you're very close), then up to a horizontal and anchor.P7: Up a white streak on very low-angle slab past one bolt to a ledge, clip a second bolt, then a short dark slab past an overlap to the anchors. 105' (maybe possible to rap with a 60m rope; a single 70m is certainly plenty).P8- There seems to now be an 8th pitch added since the climb was established...or at least an anchor rather than trees for the top.

Rookie Ridge (incomplete),106487480.0,Trad,111065739.0,5.8-,1100.0,4.0,2.5,2.0,"[ NOTE: In an e-mail communication, Bradley reports that this climb is ""...on the buttress above right of the longest slab on the on the right side  of the Main Slab that begins left of the cascade."" R. Hall ]      We started above the waterfall stream of the slab's right side, 100+ft up. I proceeded up this slab section roped up. This was soon abandoned by us preferring to solo. At the second largest waterfall section we came to, I led left and up until I finished up a very lichen covered and finally dirty detour(5-6),protected by a pine tree. We stayed roped together through steep damp forest with many scattered loose field stone rocks for 150ft. We returned to the slabs above the falls and continued soloing. At the end of the slabs I detoured left through the forest, Ryan soloed up a steeper section (5-3), Tak was belayed up it. After that we did the first climb I know of to go up the highest buttresses southwest or right of the central slabs on Mt. Webster. There are four buttresses. There is much potential for free climbing on solid granite (besides the usual annoyance rocks on first ascents). I chose the standard route to do on the second Buttress's face. It had belay safety away from rocks falling onto us. On most standard routes there are some loose rocks. The rocks we encountered none of them were poised to fall. Hazardous to trailing ropes though. A rock heavily damaged one of our ropes, as Ryan led the first pitch. It happened after all of the initial 5-7 cruxes were over. He had, had a sustained pitch when he entered the forest to belay. The forest is the next section on this buttress. It's mostly short brush and pine with a couple of larger trees on it. There is one section of decent but short moderate slab climbing. Above 150ft of forest is the rock buttress again. Directly over us was the same crack system we had started out from. After the crack's finish (5-8) there is a large platform 20ft to the right to belay from under the ceiling or unfortunately a hanging belay to the left directly in line with our climb. We didn't have any time left to hang around. This buttress has a separate line up this cliff ten feet to the left of us that is closer to the edge of the ridge's face. This variation is a slightly easier line than the one we took. This area has way better belay ledges. I went down after the crux crack to make a rappel station. It started to rain as we rappelled 80ft of a beautifully inclined wall of ramps that will eat protection except for the 6+ft mantle onto the ramp to our rappel station.     We encountered four thunderstorms during our ten hours of getting down the mountain side. We had one flashlight that worked but worked only for a short while, before it was put back into it's drying off place. Also I threw my hip out nearly at the start of our descent. I couldn't walk slopes. Stayed on my ass for most of the way down.     This mountain is the first mountain to meet the weather forcing itself over the Presidentials. I knew what we were going to be in for. We packed extremely light but also were prepared for a unplanned change over to dry clothing. We also had light weight rain gear (30gl hefty trash bags). This was just enough to ward off hypothermia.    Has Webster mountain been the most overlooked granite faced mountain in the White Mountains?     It does have much deteriorating granite on some of the buttress faces. Where there is gray granite on the faces it is deteriorated but the rock isn't weakened enough in most areas to not provide solid rock protection. Falling bare skinned on this granite could cut somebody up because of it's millions of highly cubical small gray quartz in the rock.     The internal walls of the gullies are completely different in composition. The walls haven't been exposed to the same weathering. The walls of this gully between the first and ours rappelled (called by some ice climbers the Green Chasm) are like North Conway granite except it is a darker orange brown. Any lead climbing falling off on these walls would be into the air.     I went up to Webster to know for sure I remembered what I had seen twenty five years ago. I probably won't return. Not because I don't want too. I want to do these climbs I've seen. Medically, professionals have told me since 2004 to stop climbing. I'm stopping this kind of climbing for now.    Lastly these buttress cliffs are in the middle of no where. No one is going to come to help you after dark. Getting to an injured climber down in the daylight would be an involved intricate rescue. Climb safely to keep the mountain Rescue people safe.","{106178530: 3, 107166848: 2}"

It was first aid soloed by Jamal in one rope stretching push, and with the later addition of bolted anchors and 3 protection bolts for the second pitch has since become a popular free climb. Any aspiring hardperson trad leader should make the effort to get them selves out to try it. It is a NH classic, one of the plums that Green's has to offer.  Take care protecting the bottom section, where the technical crux is, getting a semi blind small cam placement in the best spot. If you take your time getting this, and maybe down climb to get a better look, you should be fine. Do tape well, hands and fingers. After the short crux you get a no hands rest standing atop a big flake. If you are crafty, you can get some good gear in above, tie yourself off and lower a bite and haul up the rest of your rack. From the flake continue up the pumpy but well protectable finger and hand crack to a bolted belay.  After the first belay, you will ascend a short bulging corner to gain a cruxy, bolt protected pocket section, and then cruiser crack in corner to a nice rest on a big round flake to contemplate the puzzling finish run to the top.  After further cleaning and inspection, Dima found an offset cam could be used in lieu of the last bolt. A green .75 cam could be placed in a pocket in exchange for the lower bolt also, but it would be in a handhold and would run more risk of the rope jamming. Certainly the route could be done by a stronger party as a single pitch avoiding the bolts if they wished. That would be a nice way to do it. If you do belay in the middle I suggest clipping the first bolt though to preclude a high fall factor fall onto the belay. We have decided to leave all the bolts for the time being, as all others who have been on the route since have suggested that (most people don't have offset cams), but once you have climbed it, let us know how you feel.","{105885115: 4, 106646308: 4, 13833: 4, 108529353: 4, 110739544: 4, 108522460: 4, 107377680: 4, 108032974: 4, 106967283: 4, 108871640: 4, 106538248: 4, 106942302: 4, 106588271: 4, 108943993: 3}"

P1 - Climb past the bolt to the far end of the large tree ledge (optional belay here). Climb the steep, but featured ""pillars"", to a 2nd bolt, past this ( crux, seemed harder than 5.6 to me!) Then to a flake and trend right [VAR] to a double bolt anchor. 130 ft    P2 - Climb past the one bolt and up clean rock to the moss and the overlap; climb through the overlap ""at its lowest point"" at a crack / flare ""that accepts cams"".  Placing a cam here reduces the quality of the handhold, but be careful as I think it's MUCH harder than the 5.3 given in the guide. 120-130 ft. (NOTE: the move may ""go"" 4-5 ft left of the crack itself, DUH!)     VARiation- Alternately, one can continue straight up on the left to the overlap.

This is about 25-30 ft right of ""B-Day Brushings"".  Alternately, from the Height-of-Land section, from about 35-40 ft below the highest point of land, move climber's left and down on a (usually) leaf-covered, sloping ledge to the corner.

After that ""it all came together"".  Really very nice climbing, although P1 has some pretty hard moves below and just above that pin. Then there are the moves at the top of the face....5.7X. The rating assigned by the ""old school"" Brit Paul Ross was 5.7 and I've kept that as a 5.7+ for consistency, but I think the climbing is harder than that!  Pitch 2 is an interesting tour on it's own, and highly recommended provided you have a full set of TriCams.

Now easily up to a large ledge, then Left to a right-facing flake that leads to the dike which are now ""twin SEAMS"" (ya, they did look like cracks from below, didn't they!). Up these (5.7 R/X) to a good ledge system. [possible to belay here] Now a rising traverse left (crossing Bonsai) on much easier ground for 50-60 +/- feet to the belay (old piton and a new bolt anchor) at the right-hand-side of a curving flake that turns into an arch. 130-140 ft 5.7+ to 5.8 R/X NOTE:From the belay the ground can be reached with a single 70m rope, but not a single 60m.  Variation- Instead of climbing up under the undercling, step left to a short right-facing flake; up this then back right to the main route. Unfortunately, the pro at the flake is less than ideal AND you are out-of-position for clipping the piton.  P2- A VERY nice pitch which should see more traffic using the easy approach from the Tsunami ledge. (See Crazy Woman Driver for details) BRING TRICAMS !  P2- Step left from the belay (thus crossing Crazy Woman Driver) and then over the quartz intrusions, (look for a ""hole"" for a small-medium tricam) then up and slightly left headed for a line of three ""partially formed"" solution pockets. Up these and onto a shallow ramp [5.5 / 5.6 PG-13/R] that slants uphill to the right. (the ""5th pocket"" is fully formed and accepts a large TriCam). Continue up to another, smaller solution hole (small TriCam or Orange Alien). Here, move left [Var. 2.] and up along a line of solution pockets and an interesting quartz dike.

The rock may feel friable, but it has gotten a lot of traffic and no more holds have broken. There is a very large partially detached flake that the route finishes on, it hasn't moved yet, but it looks a little scary.   A great route to put together. 13a is my best guess for the grade, but would love to hear other opinions.","{106116543: 4, 106884076: 4, 107128552: 3}"

You can't protect much till you're about 15 feet up, but the going is fairly easy, even for a short person (I'm 5'0"").  Use the ledges to move up, placing pro when possible, aiming for a dirt ledge at a left-facing corner with a small (3 inch diameter trunk) birch tree growing from it. Move up past the tree into a corner with white rock, place pro, and move higher up into the corner. Skirt the blank block to your right (good feet), and then climb up the block. There's pro here. This is the first crux, especially for a short person. It's fairly difficult moving up the wide crack here.  Move up the crack until you come to a cave on a ledge (second crux). The cave is about 20 inches high, and partially blocked by a basketball sized boulder. Be careful - this boulder is completely loose! Watch your rope to be sure you don't push it onto your belayer! You will have to decide how to get past this obstacle - I'm not sure how the FA did it, and I don't know if there's a best way, but in our case the leader went behind the boulder, being careful to place pro in the cave so the rope wouldn't push the boulder down. You might be able to go straight up to avoid the cave, or traverse in front of it.  Once you've groveled out of the cave, move up a wide crack (pro), up past a dirty ledge, and you'll find a rap station. Think about how you're going to get down in advance; if you have only a 60m rope you may not be able to rap to the ground. There's also a rap station to climber's left, which should lead down past ""The Hawk"", also 110 ft. Don't trust the tat - bring your own.  In the Handren guide, this route is graded as 5.4. However, I found it much harder than the two 5.4 routes at nearby Lost Horizon (and harder than any 5.4 I've climbed at the Gunks), so I'm giving it a 5.6 here.

It has cruxes, but the route could not be considered bouldery. It has a few heartbreaking moves at the top that don't seem that bad when you're fresh, but when you're pumped, it's a whole different story. In other words, you have to consider yourself a true sport climber to send Eyeless.    This might explain the shenanigans that went into sending this route. Climbers attempted this route for a few years before it was bolted. They used dubious pro, including pins that were pounded in behind some of the thin flakes that make for great incut edges for handholds. Between every attempt, the pins had to be pounded back in because the force of the fall loosened them. The route was eventually clandestinely bolted and sent, proving that Eyeless was always meant to be a sport route, despite the predominant ethic of the day.    To find the route, locate the beautiful orange, slightly overhanging wall with a line of flakes leading to anchors at the 60 foot mark. To start, climb up a strange dike for a few feet and then head right onto a mini-slab and then up the face. The technical crux comes early, at the third bolt,  and involves a tenuous lock off to reach a small flake sidepull. The pumpy moves continue as the angle is unrelenting.     You might find it surprising that the redpoint crux is clipping the final bolt (or you may have before reading this). The hand holds are just slopey enough to make you want to move on, yet there's that pesky issue of clipping the bolt. A sequential move or two and a powerful move up into an undercling leads to the anchors.      Eyeless, like many other routes in this area of the cliff, stays dry in the rain.

In order to do this from the ground, I stick clip both a short draw and a super-long draw onto the second bolt of Yellow Matter.

Very cool plume of powder and a very sad event). I believe the climber who placed the pin was Jensen. Jensen probably traversed into this corner like I did. He could have started far to the right or east in one of the tree and dirt filled corners. There's a lot of rock in this area once a climber gets past these corners off the ground.

Rappel from these Oak trees to another Oak tree to the ground.    This climb is a classic because it's so steep and not a severe ascent. First ascents are always dirty and have lichen growth. Climbers could wire brush it and then it would look like every other classic wire brushed climb that is often traveled upon, keeping the lichen and dirt from reforming. So if you don't know what a first ascent means you won't appreciate the atmospheric prospective that is often on routes like this one at Owl's Head, besides it's a south east facing wall prone to plant and tree growth.      Although this is the completed route the final line will summit by a traverse onto E12 finish and the first pitch will be modified to climb a crack east of the Pine tree on the first pitch to a different belay off of a horn where the crack ends. This will be a semi-hanging belay in the same left facing corner of the second pitch. From this horn the climb will join up with the second pitch without the giant flake moves. This way up the cliff should be at the same rating as the climb already done. The horn doesn't have to be the belay because a 60m rope will reach the second pitch belay. This climb is definitely not for the (5-7) maximum difficulty leader. There are situations on the route where a short fall will do injury. For Owl's Head this climb is a very well protected one.    There is a small (large toaster oven) semi loose exfoliating section at the top of pitch three in the left facing corner. It is easily avoided and not a problem unless it is forced off by pulling hard on it or putting protection in the crack, where this corner is separated from the wall. Climb wisely and everyone should stay alive.   This is my last outback crag climb because the odds of injury and possibly death are now stacked up way too high, against me. I couldn't lead any of this climb on the day Ryan and I did this new route. That is because I have chronic skeletal and neurological muscular relationship health issues. This has finally finished me off, from leading anywhere, until I recover again. When I am able to, I will continue off the road climbs rated easy to moderate. I knew this day had to come eventually. After all I have done already more outback crag leading than I thought I would. I am very pleased with how many I have done. I've known since 2002 I couldn't climb anymore. That didn't stop my will to do more climbs. The temptation to do more first ascents on outback crags (especially here) still exist, but I have voluntarily discharged myself from doing anymore permanently. Fu#k that nuero/muscular sh#t!

Do face moves (5-11b) to friction left (5-9) to bolt and long sling it to friction right (5-8) to bolt long sling it and rest. Head straight up shallow corner to dubious pin (5-8R). This is as far as I remember getting with Jim in 1986. Make a long reach (5-8) to clip bolt. Do friction steps across, below the bolt (You'll have to put much slack in the line to do this free. The slightest amount of any tension changes this crux to 5-11,A0). In this case anyone seconding it free isn't leading it free, and that's controversial.     Get to a face hold move to make a long reach past it, to a sloping large hold and dynamically swing and charge at the same time up (maximum no hands mantle step up) to reach a shallow arch (5-10). Get in stoppers and traverse under cling (5-10c) until arch ends move up face traversing to another shallow arch (5-10c) to hanging belay (stoppers and bolt). Use this bolt to protect (5-10d) friction step up to inside corner facing right and climb corner pins (5-8+). Corner ends at traverse ledge left. Friction up to corner like arch with 1-2"" parallel crack underneath it diagonal under cling (5-6) to (5-8) no hand friction step up above arch to grab the ledge mantling onto the rappel ledge (This pitch can be combined leading it with two 60mm ropes). Rappel the route or climb up the break in the last arch above you (5-6) to easy 5th classing past many tree ledges 2 pitches to summit. I did the first complete ascent with Tom Armstrong in 1987 and he freed the crux third pitch at (5-11+).     I did all this work bolting it and ended up only leading the top section once. I'm sure this climb is in need of retro-bolting and possibly elimination of the run out caused by the dubious corner pin at the crux section.     It is unlike the Rapper. It is not dangerous and should be left as it was fashioned too be. The falls may be long on the easier sections but the cruxes are not run out and safe for both the leader and the second. It's named Spare Ribs because it is a climb that goes up many shallow under cling arches. Besides that if it was food for thought on how a friction/ face climbing should be it would be very yummy. vertical height 400ft.","{106178530: 4, 106524284: 4}"

Northeast Ridge of the Pinnacle,106304119.0,Trad,110935877.0,5.7,900.0,7.0,3.4,161.0,"This description covers the rock route. The Pinnacle is perhaps more notable as a winter climb, and should be listed separately as such. The summer route is a classic alpine rock climb.  The Pinnacle, located high on Mt. Washington in Huntington Ravine, has been an objective of mountaineers dating back to the Underhills. It has a long and interesting history, explained at length in Webster's 3rd edition guide. An ascent of the route is a fine adventure, easy enough for the less experienced but classic enough for anyone to enjoy.  The Pinnacle is a prominent, blocky schist arete on the Huntington Ravine headwall. Its summit is a sharp ridge just below the Alpine Garden, and is a fine vantage point from which to view the ravine floor and the mountains to the east.  Pitch 1: Climb 4th class up a prominent, left-angling gully with some birch trees in it and reach a ledge. Continue up and right, staying close to the arete and entering 5th class territory as you climb a slab and a 5.5 right-facing corner. 5.5, ~150 feet  Pitch 2: Trend up and slightly left towards the steep, angular upper reaches of the Pinnacle. A well-traveled route up slabs and between bushes should be obvious. Belay at a flat area below a steep, right-facing inside corner. Easy 5th, ~150 feet  Pitch 3: Climb the corner. Clip a pin at half height and continue making technical moves until a jug on the right wall is reached. Mantle up and left onto a ledge. Here the line becomes less obvious as it moves left to a corner, then awkwardly up and right along a ramp (some crawl here!) before reaching a final mantle and a good belay ledge. 5.7, ~70 feet  Pitch 4: The original variation leaves the belay ledge and downclimbs a ramp to the left. After about 40 feet, a stance is reached below a chimney. Some belay here. With difficulty, climb a sloping ledge to enter the chimney. Ascend this, protecting using a chockstone and a few nut placements, to its end and a belay stance. 5.7, ~90 feet  Pitch 4a: The 5.8 direct variation. From the belay atop pitch 3, climb straight up on flakes, making long reaches between holds. Several pins protect the difficult moves. In 20 feet, after reaching an overhang, climb out left with considerable exposure, quickly turning right and passing between two blocks. Continue up easier ground to a belay stance, or continue 80 feet to an immense belay ledge (rope drag). 5.8, ~70 feet. *A 5.9+ variation leaves right from the p3 belay and follows steep ground up towards the arete proper.  Pitch 5: Ascend easy 5th class to an enormous belay ledge (size of a baseball infield). Easy 5th, 80 feet  Pitch 6: Walk 50 feet through alpine scrub and climb a steep 20-foot step. Taking the right side closer to the arete is more difficult at 5.6, while the left hand groove is around 5.4 and leads through a boulder tunnel to a belay ledge. The 5.6 pitch is recommended, as it puts the climber in a fine position close to the arete for the final 100 feet. 5.4 or 5.6, ~130 feet  Pitch 7: From a large belay area, either continue easily over blocks to the summit of the Pinnacle, or (vastly more recommended) move right around an overhang to the arete proper. With fantastic exposure, traverse across the top of the arete (Fairy Tale Traverse) to a niche and final corner, which is tackled to reach the summit. 5.5, ~130 feet  **Note** The Pinnacle is above treeline on one of America's deadliest peaks. The weather is unpredictable and often comes in from the west (over the Mt. Washington summit, thus invisible). Snow occurs in every month of the year on Mt. Washington, and high winds, driving rain, and thunderstorms are common. Be sensible. Check the forecast, get an early start, and be prepared to bail if things go bad. From most points on the route, it is possible to move left off the Pinnacle into a moderate gully, where descent would be arduous but safe. There is no excuse to be caught on the summit in poor conditions. In fact, on the approach hike, you'll see a yellow sign with the following text: ""STOP. The area ahead has the worst weather in America. Many have died there, even in the summer. Turn back now if the weather is bad."" Be careful up there.  **Other note** Mt. Washington and the Northern Presidentials are home to some of the east coast's rarest plants. Many of the sedges and dwarf alpine plant species only exist in a few square miles of northeastern alpine zone. Be careful of the plants and try to avoid treading on them as much as possible. This is especially true on the top, where a 1/4 mile hike through the Alpine Garden is necessary to gain the descent trail. Try and rock hop as much as possible to preserve the fragile alpine flora.","{107572777: 4, 106726952: 4, 107525760: 4, 107032446: 4, 106874511: 4, 106299993: 4, 106150571: 4, 105801390: 4, 105971523: 4, 106280222: 4, 105832216: 4, 106399404: 4, 106178530: 4, 107153515: 4, 107208888: 4, 106394111: 4, 106441684: 4, 107579039: 4, 108167549: 4, 107730254: 4, 107450627: 4, 107242815: 4, 107574666: 4, 107548227: 4, 107373999: 4, 108188613: 4, 108112688: 4, 106146571: 4, 108361107: 4, 108346136: 4, 108843325: 4, 110906560: 4, 109136692: 4, 109884416: 4, 108323817: 4, 109936563: 4, 108181716: 4, 109479296: 4, 110315255: 4, 109460613: 4, 109293680: 4, 108179333: 4, 111796230: 4, 106403862: 4, 108222002: 4, 107678121: 4, 112038160: 4, 111657384: 4, 106879280: 4, 112207022: 4, 110433236: 4, 110739544: 4, 107873850: 4, 200329835: 4, 200184428: 4, 200315966: 4, 113180669: 4, 112527602: 4, 110494556: 4, 200490023: 4, 106990659: 4, 110371583: 4, 109057647: 4, 200519004: 4, 200415856: 4, 110327172: 4, 200124706: 4, 108179890: 4, 106930624: 4, 200524014: 4, 200246542: 4, 200427395: 4, 110452119: 4, 110575515: 4, 200253285: 4, 107629487: 4, 200297969: 4, 109406130: 4, 106917454: 4, 111278312: 4, 200743821: 4, 106125724: 3, 107226876: 3, 105922881: 3, 105890157: 3, 106741672: 3, 106579529: 3, 106932322: 3, 106567319: 3, 108401186: 3, 106460502: 3, 108894743: 3, 107727480: 3, 106646308: 3, 109584993: 3, 108310475: 3, 108228481: 3, 108321835: 3, 108137876: 3, 109369258: 3, 107068335: 3, 108454711: 3, 109052547: 3, 109316466: 3, 106210225: 3, 106095990: 3, 106325770: 3, 111481667: 3, 107130713: 3, 106679659: 3, 107494185: 3, 106526829: 3, 109411750: 3, 112261455: 3, 112134112: 3, 112091216: 3, 109393254: 3, 108301940: 3, 111124567: 3, 200148109: 3, 107169450: 3, 200152826: 3, 200359054: 3, 107552617: 3, 107318184: 3, 111870630: 3, 107400819: 3, 200406385: 3, 200264338: 3, 200485328: 3, 200078397: 3, 200282021: 3, 111769967: 3, 106768437: 3, 200446050: 3, 200361391: 3, 111849990: 3, 112166651: 3, 200384668: 3, 106430658: 2, 106678944: 2, 106001645: 2, 108124265: 2, 106360234: 2, 105891309: 2, 107617264: 2, 108252197: 2, 108200547: 2, 111841723: 2, 112423730: 2, 108943993: 2, 200374248: 2, 107768941: 2, 200199785: 2, 200146694: 2, 7025226: 2, 111777299: 2, 200213938: 2, 105798761: 1, 111709795: 1}"

I would argue Primal Scream is in contention as one the great long 5.10 multipitch climbs of the east, rivaling VMC DD and Fastest Gun.   The route tackles the foreboding right side of the Pinnacle buttress. It involves some incredibly steep rock, some tricky traverses, thin cracks, lovely dihedrals, and at least one spicy runout. A guaranteed adventure for the confident 5.10 leader. The route has a nice safety net since you can escape onto the northeast ridge fairly easily at any point before pitch 5.   P1: short 5.8 face that leads to steep notch in an overhang 25 feet off the ground. Pull some hard layback moves with good gear (10d) to gain the face. Follow the face straight up to some grassy ledges. Choose one to belay from. 150' 5.10d  P2: Depending on where you set the anchor  for pitch 1, either traverse right, or climb up and right toward the obvious twin cracks. Enjoy a short section of 5.9 crack climbing before finishing on top of this block 50-70' 5.9  P3: From the belay move directly right onto a short, well protected 10c finger traverse. Make some airy moves to pull onto the next green face. Climb the picturesque 5.9 thin finger crack on the slabby face up to a left facing corner. Climb the corner through a notch to a good slanting ledge. 110' 10c  P4: Now for the mental crux. Place a couple small pieces as you traverse directly right on some good feet. The gear disappears quickly, but the moves are no harder than 5.6. slot a small nut into a constriction on the arete (offset might be nice) Climb up on some good edges on the arete until it is possible to move onto the next green face out right. When I got here and looked at the next traverse I thought, F no, this is messed up I'm not climbing any further above this nut. But the crimps are there, and so are the feet. A fall would be really bad here, but the climbing is more secure than it looks. The book gives it 10a, but I pulled off a small flake revealing a nice edge that makes it a little easier. I would argue no moves are harder than 5.9. Traverse 12 feet right into a flared chimney, with great relief, place gear, and climb straight up the corner under a huge roof. The book recommends belaying under the roof, but I recommend continuing another 10 feet on a finger / hand traverse out right to a nice ledge on the next arete. This gives the belayer a good view of the previous pitch, and the next. 80' 10a R  P5: Traverse directly right on a crack reminiscent of the Fairy Tale Traverse. Belay at the obvious ledge 50' 5.8  P6: Downclimb the face below and to the right keeping just above the overhang. Move right to the base of a nice, obvious finger crack. 50' 5.8  P7: Climb the finger crack up and right until it starts to break up. Climb the broken cracks staying just left of a dirty groove. Climb over a small bulge at a curved flake. Belay at the base of a corner with small roof at the top of it. (the last crux of the route) 120' 5.9  P8: Climb the corner up to the roof.

The crux is getting off the ground, especially if you are short, although there is some 5.4-5.5 climbing up by the upper crack(s).      Joe's Place is an unlikely route up the far right hand side of the main face. Starting at the overhang between the Standard Route start and Thriller, pull out left towards an arete on good holds until it is possible to move around the corner onto a slab.

Navigate easy terrain around a bush. Continue with more difficulty up the discontinuous crack system, but using mainly face holds. Either establish an awkward belay at half height or keep going.

Standard Route,105973013.0,Trad,105973007.0,5.4,130.0,2.0,2.8,60.0,"HISTORY: The FA of this route was done in 1943 by Bill (""William Lowell"") Putnam and Brooks Dodge in 1943. (Brooks was the son of Joe Dodge, who ran the AMC's Pinkam Notch camp from its inception in 1922 to 1959 [1928-1959 as Manager of the Hut system]), probably (?) just before Bill went to Camp Hale, Colorado to train the 10th Mt Division. Bill would later take part (as a Pvt.) in ""removing"" the Japanese from Kiska Island (Alaska) the only US territory Japan occupied during WWII.  Here his climb to the volcanic high point of the island took a bit longer than anticipated and resulted in AWOL, the ""punishment"" for which was to lead the entire company up as a training exercise the next day. During action in Italy in 1945 with 10th Mt. Division he took shrapnel to the chest (lungs) and missed the action at Riva Ridge and Mt Belvedere, but (now as a First Lieutenant) took part in the final push into northern Italy. After the war he would make the 2nd ascent of Mt St Elias in Alaska, lead many trips to the Adamant-Austerity range in the Selkirks of British Columbia, and serve as both President and Honorary President of the American Alpine Club.         Climbing up the middle of three cracks on the main face, Standard Route is a classic. Though it can be done in one push, most prefer to break it up into 2 pitches. The first belay is usually about 2/3 of the way up the face on a small ledge. This allows the belayer to always be within sight of their leader.     One can choose to either follow the crack system to the summit, or use the massive face holds. Either way, engaging climbing awaits all the way to the summit- just play it to your strengths.","{106280222: 4, 108310475: 4, 108222002: 4, 200078397: 4, 200056611: 4, 106726952: 4, 106150571: 4, 108477035: 4, 200427395: 4, 109207991: 3, 109290328: 3, 109411750: 3, 200691002: 3, 108587373: 3, 109136692: 3, 110547878: 3, 200064504: 3, 112038160: 3, 200067404: 3, 200101052: 3, 106095990: 3, 200069147: 3, 7093326: 3, 106342472: 3, 111426821: 3, 105938601: 3, 105945019: 3, 106399472: 3, 106852549: 3, 106134707: 3, 106726589: 3, 106741672: 3, 106567319: 3, 106767711: 3, 110156785: 3, 107242815: 3, 107788440: 3, 106751248: 2, 105971523: 2, 107318184: 2, 110591893: 2, 107629960: 2, 105922881: 2, 106360234: 2, 108228481: 2, 200246542: 2, 106630260: 2, 109022464: 2, 108590756: 2, 106469016: 2, 106978809: 2, 107336862: 2, 110454932: 2, 107155653: 2, 106854014: 2, 200243614: 2, 107253738: 2, 112527602: 2, 109316466: 1}"

The mission was to pour over every inch of Dickie Ledge to find some gems that had been overlooked. I picked this line out easily when I noticed the steep wall perched above the more popular Dark Side. This route and it's brother were just what I was looking for. Near-vertical tech climbing with mixed gear and crimpy little cruxes perched in a magical location.  This one is a few feet longer than Worlds Collide. Start in the crack just left of the short slab that leads up to the start of Worlds. Layback and jam your way up to the first hoizontal and place a piece (there is a large block that vibrates but doesn't seem like it's going anywhere. Still, don't place any gear against it.) The business starts here. Match on a good crimp rail down and right of the first bolt. Make your clip and embark on a dicey technical boulder problem. These were the hardest moves for me and the sequence ends with a full on toss to a slightly sloping edge in the second horizontal crack. Place another piece of gear... shake off... Clip a bolt... and make another improbable set of moves on tiny ""Dickie nubbins"" culminating in yet another, even more desperate toss for the slopy cliff top. I placed the anchor about 5 feet to the right where there is an actual jug to clip or better yet top-out and have a seat. Unfortunately the last move favors folks (like me) with a good reach. The tiny holds involved may be nice for a smaller climbers hands however so best thing to do is head up and give it a try.  This thing will surely feel better on a crisp fall day than it did in the humidity I've been facing. Also both climbs on this face are much more reasonable with a few key hold ticked. Onsights would be extremely proud.",{105906559: 3}
Viewfinder,113526036.0,Trad,113526026.0,5.8,200.0,2.0,2.8,8.0,"The name says it all. This route finishes spectacularly with one of my favorite views in the White Mountains. On top of that expect fun varied climbing on amazing granite from bottom to top!  My vision for this line was to open up a safe climb at a moderate grade for folks getting in to trad climbing. So I did add some bolts where I would have just run it out personally. It is not however a sport route so expect some run out sections on 5.3-ish climbing.   Notes added after hearing feedback: It has been brought to my attention by a few people that I had underestimated this climb when I first did it. I have upped the grade to 5.8 as I am happy to bend to the consensus and honestly don't like choosing grades in the first place. It has also been pointed out that without super solid rope handling there could be danger on the upper headwall of hitting the deck if you blew one of the tricky moves at the end. If you do feel like this could be an issue you could build an anchor closer to the headwall to make rope management easier. Perhaps the crack at the end of Say Nothing (5.5) would offer a good spot to reduce rope stretch. The very beginning flake requires care as well.  place gear only where the flake meets the cliff and take your time placing even if it means you need to hang on it after. That's better than a ground fall. So my vision of a route for novices may not have been perfect but I am not willing to bolt a crack up on DIckie so I will say ALWAYS spend the time you need to place good gear, communicate with your belayer and only climb with people you trust to save your life. There are other routes at the grade and below now, so you could warm up on Say Nothing, Watching Me and or Watching You and the Dark Corridor.   Pitch 1: The start moves and the finish move are the hardest parts for sure. Either stem off of the tree to gain the flake or (perhaps a little hard for 5.7) avoid the tree. Either way protect above the flake (the flake makes a good hold but I wouldn't trust it with a cam behind it in a fall). Mantle a nice ledge and then clip a couple of bolts while figuring out a tricky slab. After the tricky bit, romp up a very easy slab following a clean white streak and eventually gaining a belay at an oak tree (rappel set up on tree).  Pitch 2: Step above the tree on to a couple of ledges. Move right to a big flake and use this to get up on top of the low angle slab above. Another cruiser slab (a little run out but 5.3) leads to two short slab headwalls with a ledge between. Surmount these slabs protected by bolts and gear and move up on a ledge to stand below the final sleep headwall. With a little finesse make your way in to the obvious crack with good pro. Be carful of one block that wouldn't be good to protect behind. Make your way through the path of least resistance until a perplexing final crux (place solid gear) makes you think twice (5.8). I used high feet and solid balance to lean out left for a thank god hold and a final mantle to the 2 bolt anchor.  Enjoy the view while you bring up your second.  2 rappels with a 60m rope should get you down in style (throw knots in the ends just in case of course ;)","{111610436: 3, 107346586: 3, 105906559: 3, 110679645: 3, 108222002: 3, 107852661: 3, 108310475: 2, 106253664: 2}"

The ONLY down side to this one in my opinion is that the two engaging parts are split by a ledge in the middle. The first half is some of the best 5.6 friction climbing ive done and the top bit is a slightly harder puzzle to gain the chains.  You can top out the route and belay from a big ash tree if you are continuing on to one of the upper pitches. A quick scamper through the trees gets you to a comfy hang out spot and a more climbs.  Start on the right side of the slab on an obvious big hold. Use this to gain a stance and clip a bolt. Move up and left on to the dreamy slab and past 3 more bolts. At the ledge find the next couple of bolts and head that way. I dug out a crack on the right as the angle increases again. Clip 2 bolts without much trouble then smear your way up to the anchor (crux) as the wall steepens. The way I climb it is a biit to the right of the bolt line.

Perhaps now that it is clean it will speed the drying a bit.  Stand on the blocks at the base to get on to the wall. Easily clip the first bolt which keeps you from falling down the gully if you blow the low crux. Make thin balancy moves up to the overlap. Place a good piece under it and climb the low angle face above to the angled cracks. I found this section easier on the left but the right sucks you in and works as well. Just less secure IMO.

Move right easily but delicately and carefully place a piece in the right hand crack. Move up to the 2nd bolt and pull the fun slab mantle on pockets and nubbins.

Clip a high bolt before engaging with the lower crux involving a slopy, gritty crimp. Move up on better edges to a nice stance at the next horizontal and place a small piece before clipping the 2nd and last bolt and entering the puzzling final boulder problem. A few underclings/sidepulls a tiny razor edge and some serious balancy footwork and body tension get you to the lip. It's not over yet. Work your way left with effort and on to a rewarding stance where you can comfortable clip the anchor.    The rock on this section of the cliff is a little crumbly so there is a little of that.

I had thought of usurping the old movie title ""Five Easy Pieces"" but chose to more clearly indicate this posting was a list of 5 climbs.  These were all to the right of Flat Iron.  If you are into ""romping up 5.0 to 5.4 slab"" in ""adventure mode"", then stop reading here !  Climb # 1 - Start about 25+/- ft to the right of Flat Iron and climb up clean-ish rock between an ""inverted pine tree"" about 25 ft up (on the right), and bushes on the left.  P1 - about 90 ft to a 5-inch oak(?) tree with a rap/belay anchor. P2 Up shrubs, then left-ish and up thru a small overlap (some pro) and then straight up easy rock to a rap/belay anchor on a tree; which is about 40 ft up-and-right of the anchors of Flat Iron. 105 ft 5.3(?)  Disclaimer-  we only TR'd P2 of this climb, but did ""scope out"" ""P1"" on rappel, thus the ""?"". NOTE- I do not remember how much rope was left of our single 70m rope when we reached the 5-inch oak(?) tree from the anchor. Take care if using a 60m rope.   Plenty was left after rapping the lower pitch.   Climb #2 - ""Gateway"" - This was the gateway to a nice, level tree&brush ledge and a clean, upper slab. Approach - Hike up and to the right about 75-100 ft from the start of Flat Iron.  (easiest terrain seemed to be about 10-20 ft out from the where the slab enters the woods) Cut back left to a flat-ish spot where there is a 5-inch white birch tree.  On the slab, a few feet from the tree is a triangular rock about 2 ft x 2 ft x 2 ft (photo 1). P1 - Step left to gain the clean rock, take this up to an overlap (gear) and climb over the overlap (a very height dependent move; alternately pass the OL on its left end). Continue up to the tree ledge (good belay here) then straight up the white rock [photo 2] (5.3 -5.4 R/X) to a tree clump with a rap/belay anchor.  About 215 ft done as one pitch, 5.3-5.4 R/X    Climbs 3,4 and 5 Start from the tree ledge   Climb # 3 - From the tree ledge, we TR'd the steeper, grey-colored clean slab [photo 3 ] 10-15 ft right of ""Gateway"".  5.5  A thin crack about 40 ft up was cleaned out and a nut placed as a directional.  Climb # 4 - From the tree ledge, we TR'd the steep, clean white rock about 5 ft left of the obvious corner / flake [photo 4] .  5.6  A #2 Camalot (gold) was placed behind a flake about 30 ft up as a directional.  Climb # 5 - This climb was led before #4 was climbed.  Climb the corner, place pro and then make a ""tricky"" (for 5.5 or so ! )  step left and up. Above and left-ish, a gold #2 Camalot can be placed behind a horizontal flake, and further up and left the aforementioned wire nut in the thin crack. 5.4-5.5  100 ft  Rap from the fixed rap/belay station.

The route can be broken in to 3 sections:    -It starts with a big move to a sloping ledge and a mantle to a no hand rest followed by a tricky section past a big blob feature and in to another stem that can be no hands but you will want a hand on just in case ;)   -The business involves navigating the blankness that is the middle section of the corner. A smattering of micro holds, some that are just crystals, allow you to (just barely) connect the dots through to the last clip and the base of...   -The final boulder problem which is only a few moves long isn't too bad when working the route but turned out to be a redpoint crux for me. Indistinct crystaly holds that require precision and solid body tension get you to the thank god jug and the anchors. Top it out, sit on the cliff edge and take in the view. It's stunning.

The ""R"" remains since the 2nd bolt is just too-o-o-o high!

Unknown #2 is the first climb on the Saber Slab when walking left from the North Descent Gully.    See also the photo ""Saber Slab"" posted to Scepter.     Thoughtful climbing to find the easiest route to the 2nd bolt, which is (in my opinion) placed way too high, coupled with maybe the first bolt too low.

Another climb they would line up for at Whitehorse or Cathedral. The section moving past the bolts is somewhat similar to the upper face section of Arrow at the Gunks.
