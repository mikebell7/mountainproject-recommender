Just take the trail up on the far left.Like Triple Play, this bolt line can service at least three route paths - left, direct, and right.

Get ready though, the next block is right in your face and no picnic. The ledge you'll be standing on is big enough to rest and shake out before you send to the anchors. Double hard clip into the Wave bolts and use the quicklinks at the ends of the chain for lowering. That way your belayer can make a run on top rope and clean the draws and be lowered, or you can pull the rope for the belayer to lead and lower. Nice and easy - no fuss no muss.

Simply scale the arête, clipping right, pull the nose, stay on track and scoot right at the anchor and you’re done. Super fun!  Line 2: Direct and 5.8ish straight up the bolts. This is basically a face climb but you can easily grab the arête to the left for security if needed. It has small feet and hands between bolt 1 and 3 but after that you have better of both but it gets a little thin again on the upper big face. Stay true to the line and you’ll arrive dead on to the anchor.   Line 3: To the right and 5.9 runs the center of the lower face, clips left, pulls a nice little roof, and is a bit trickier than line 2 at the upper face. But just breathe, find your feet and keep moving. Grab the “goiter” (a big bulgy thing) with your right and scoot up left to the anchor. Very fun!  Lead all three in a row and you have a Grand Slam - Hat Trick if you’re a hockey fan like me! :)","{108408077: 3, 112529638: 3, 200711031: 3, 200113321: 3, 200953222: 3}"

Please Note: NO UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OR REMOVAL OF FIXED HARDWARE IS PERMITTED AT DONATION ROCKS. Name is To Be Determined till I find out if there's an historical name.This is the second sport route here at Donation to accommodate beginning climbers - especially the young campers at Stone Mountain Adventures. This is why the bolts are placed within easy reach and from solid stance ledges. They are far apart but that’s because more are not needed due to the simplicity of the climb. The first bolt is easily reached by a short climb or stick clipped.For the beginner: The start is far right at the belay spot then up an easy 4 ft to a left shelf traverse. This gets you to the first bolt and then up to the big platform ledge at the base of an overhanging dihedral which is the crux. This is a bit tricky but the secret is feet - stemming between the opposing walls into small pockets. Hands are few so take what you can get. The second bolt is near the top of the crux and offers good protection from the platform ledge. Beyond that, it’s an easy walk up through the inside dihedral of the gully. Near the top there’s another shelf traverse to the upper left and voila, you’re at the anchors. They are big a$$ mussy hooks designed for super easy clip in and lowering without knowledge of anchor building or having to untie - clip clip and go.For the experienced: Start lower - closer to the big boulder, and once passed the first bolt and the crux, stay left of the gully and more on the face.

The Flake,118007523.0,Sport,118007495.0,5.10,50.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,"I love this route! Especially now that it’s sport! Sure you can still top rope it but now you not only up your game, you eliminate the wicked swing if you come off. The 10+ rating is based on leading it. I would say it's more like 9+ on top rope fyi.  The main route is the same - sport or TR, the only real variation is at the start. When I was first doing this route I was instructed to go up the right side of the gully, up on a broad platform, then proceed to the skinny platform (what I like to call “the plank”) against the face. The problem is, that first platform gets super dirty because of debris washing down the gully. It’s dirties your hands and shoes. Not good for the next phase which happens to be the crux. I now start where the bolt line is and proceed up on clean rock avoiding the dirty platform altogether. This also sets me up to pull up and over the plank which I enjoy. Once on the plank, just spin around and get ready for the fun part!  Without getting too detailed, the premise of this section is to reach up to that diagonal flake (aka rail) above your head, and go hand-over-hand up it while working your feet between the face and the arête. The key to begin all this is mostly nerves. If you can let your mind go free and focus on the moves, you can release yourself from the plank and smoothly go into lay back mode and Git r Done. Pulling up to the last move to gain the top of this section is tough but you’ll figure it out. Hint: look for the awesome heal-hook on the arête near bolt five.  The next big phase could be considered a crux and is my favorite part - engaging and pulling the gigantic roof that looms over this entire bottom section. Again, I won’t go into detail so you can discover it for yourself, but there are holds above the roof that are bomber! After that, it’s a breeze to the anchors and a good stance while there. Here it’s best to run your rope through the bottom quick links and be lowered down or rap if you like.  Note: If you’re sport climbing, it’s best to use an extended draw at bolt seven to get your rope out from under the roof. Also this one’s really tough to clean on the descent. Have your second clean it on TR.","{108408077: 4, 200711031: 4, 200113321: 4, 200083194: 4}"

High 5,118007354.0,Sport,118007309.0,5.11c/d,40.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"This is basically a V5 boulder problem 25+ feet off the ground! Hence the name High 5. Only three bolts to the anchor but the first one is a test of nerves since it's not stick-clippable. If you're an experienced climber, getting there and clipping in is the easy part - after that it’s a completely different story! This is the sixth sport route at Donation and the hardest so far. And although it's a relatively short send to the anchors, because it's overhung and scarce on feet, it makes for a muscle and heart pumper for sure!  The grade is based on my 5' 6"" frame and reach. You tall people might find it to be different and I ask that you please comment below if you do. I'm cool with a grade change if the consensus is something different.  Ground start off-belay with a scramble up to the huge ledge/platform at the base of the buttress. Once there, have your belayer at the ready and work up to the first bolt on the underside of the buttress. I get there by climbing the block to the right then left hand on the Screaming Mimi rail and clipping with my right. I recommend an 18cm/medium length draw here to come out of the slight roof but you can use shorties from there.  The anchors are quick-links and chains so once you're hard-clipped to the Wave bolts you just need to thread the quick-links, un-clip, and lower.  Back Story: Chris Winters of the Access Fund Conservation Team and I worked this one on top rope together in the fall of 2019 and it took both of us multiple times and lots of beta sharing to construct a doable path up this beast. I can still feel the excitement belaying Chris as he took my last suggested beta to successfully pull up and out of the crux. I gave out a rebel yell that could be heard all the way to the town of Huntingdon! We had finally unlocked the crux! Since then I’ve worked it, refined it, and added a couple new moves to better suit my smaller frame and reach. Regardless, I don't always make it and I'm always out of breath at the top. The FA on lead was a redpoint and my first .12 lead!!!","{108408077: 4, 200083194: 2}"

I could see these mushroom-like protrusions coming out of the smooth face but at the time I was not advanced enough to get to them so I looked for alternative routes. I came up with an approach that took me up and far right. Then, locking a foot into the huge crack at my feet, I reached far out to my left with both hands putting my body at a 45 degree angle. Now the scary part - cutting my anchoring foot loose and hoping I could hold on! After several tries I did and was then able to use one of the mushrooms for a foot and go from there! That was the crux for sure, but getting up, balanced, and completing the next moves to the top can be tricky for sure.  That was all on top rope. Now the route should be trad-able with a bolt on the main face and the use of a bolt from High 5. Plenty of gear placement opportunities from the ground up till you get to the crux. There is where you need to clip the draw and to be safe, clip into the other one then finish at the anchors and chains above (same as High 5).  For top rope: Either anchor off the top with cord or sling, or safety yourself into one of those anchors and use the quick links of the sport anchors.",{108408077: 3}
Jam Crack Overhang,119566810.0,Trad,118008152.0,5.8,55.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,"NOTE: My mind was recently blown when, in my research, I found that this classic route, formally known as Shark’s Tooth is actually named Jam Crack Overhang - climbed and named by guys back in the ‘70s! My plan in doing this historical research was to rename routes back to their original ones due to the long climbing history and to honor those who climbed here long ago. I must say that this iconic route was a tough one to rename so please forgive me of this seeming travesty. Now though, try and embrace the new/old name from a position of respect for those intrepid climbers - some who are now legendary icons in the climbing world! Seriously. Thanks.Since this was originally intended as a trad route, the line is up the obvious crack in the second layer block so the start is directly below. The lower block is a good mini warm up that works its way up to the overhung second block which gives this route part of its name. There you encounter protruding horizontal rock features that can be tough but offer great hands and stances. Once on top of those, you take the crux, the “Jam Crack”, straight on with hand jams or lay it back (which I find to be the most fun) to achieve the top of that block. Once there, the rest is a light challenging climb up the next two blocks to the top. Something to note: If you’re top roping, the anchors are to the right of the crux making for a good swing to the right if the climber comes off.

And if it's a classic from the '70s, I named it after a classic image from then of a guy stepping out big and “truckin’” along (see photo). With crimps, cracks, good hands, solid feet and flowing moves, you're going to love it and... ""truck"" right up!The current start is to the left of the tree and a bit tricky, but with some cleaning work the right side should be an option too and should prove an easier start. From the left go up and around the backside of the tree and continue right to the vertical crack above (see photo) which is the crux for sure. Engage the crack and power up. Look for the baby pine tree (please don’t pull out), stay left of that, and continue up from there. The higher you go the better the hands and feet.This route has great potential for gear placement so will not be bolted for sport. You tradsters should love it!

So you set up the nice big overhanging rappel for Joe.  You connect up his ATC, wrap up his auto block, and then tell him to just lean back into that 40 feet of open space.  ""Don't worry, you can't fall, just don't let go with that right hand!""    Joe's looking at you with wide eyes and letting go of the rope to cling to the rock even though you just told him to never let go of the rope.  You realize that a big overhanging rappel might be a little bit too much too soon.  Maybe you just need to get in line for the Beginner Face.  You've done it 1000 times, but it is the only Rim Road climb a completely inexperienced climber in athletic shoes even has a shot at.  Or is it???    As you're standing around near the Beginner Face you spot another line.  Someone could scramble the chimney 20 feet to the right of the Beginner Face, up to a big wide ledge.  From that ledge it might be possible to climb a short face and top out on top of the Beginner Block.  It looks possible...  maybe even in athletic shoes.    So you run up top, jump the gap, set up an anchor, jump back across the gap, run back down again and voila...  You have an alternate beginner route established. Joe can climb the chimney to the ledge at least.  Maybe he can even make it all the way up and out in his athletic shoes.  Plus the wide ledge half way up the climb offers a great place to teach someone how to rappel.  With the ropes hanging from above, transition onto a rappel is a breeze.    So much more than the cobbled together mess that is might seem to be, The Total Newbs Climbing and Rappelling Training Route offers an alternative to the always busy Beginners Face.  Then there are those folks who find even the 5.4 Beginners Face a little tricky or exposed.  This alternative route offers many starting options and can be climbed quite easily up to the ledge, even by beginners in athletic shoes.  Being largely in a chimney adds that false sense of security which nervous new climbers crave.  Once on the ledge you have a perfect place from which to practice rapelling techniques.  Or the bold new climber can take a shot at the second half.    This route can in fact be climbed all the way in tennis shoes.  However above the ledge there are a few tricky moves and sketchy moments that earn the route a 5.5 overall grade.  Up to the ledge it is a 5.2 or 5.3, above the ledge is solid 5.5, noticeably more interesting than the 5.4 Beginner Face just to its left.    While the chimney on the lower half offers easy lines, as you progress out around the left arete and onto the main rock face some interesting and more challenging lines can be explored using the same top rope set up.  You essentially get to protected boulder on the arete and main face, while Joe gets to climb and rappel at a modest grade.","{200136370: 2, 200243255: 2, 200761850: 2}"

Due to the length of the climb, the first time I did this I did it in two pitches, setting up a belay on the loose ledges at the base of the chimney. Don't do this. There is tons of loose rock on these ledges, rope management here sends showers of rocks down on to your belayer. I strongly suggest leading this climb in one long 160-foot pitch. the climbing is very easy, use some longer slings.    Climb the crack system using larger gear to the base of the Witches Brew Chimney (5.3). Climb the chimney--the key piece of pro will be on the south wall of the chimney--horizontal crack takes a pink Tri-cam or small C4.    Do not climb to the top of the chimney. You will get trapped under a chockstone. Instead, climb about 2/3 way up, then exit the chimney by stepping around the north corner onto the sunny exposed face to the left of the chimney (5.3).

The Adjustor,108643621.0,Boulder,108643612.0,V8-9,9.0,1.0,2.9,7.0,"The Adjustor is one of the better known problems of it's grade at the main Mount Gretna area, but is not one of the best quality problems.  The name comes from holds breaking on the upper half after the first ascent, which required an adjustment in movement and beta and how to use the new and different handholds.  The sequences and handholds went through changes for the first couple of years.  Today, and for the last nine years or so, everything has stayed solid.      Begin by sit starting with your butt on the ground or on a single pad.  The right hand is in a large, incut triangular tooth down low and the left hand on a gaston three-quarter pad edge.  The starting footholds are large and flat, especially for diabase.  The hips should be in close to the wall.  Pull on and rock up hard on the right foot to grasp the main hold of the climb; a gaston that is held with the right hand and contains a contorted thumb catch underneath.    Perch the right foot on the right hand starting tooth and shove in a marginal right knee scum beneath the diagonal roof to keep you in close to the wall for when you release a handhold.  Bump the left hand to a undercling on the roof feature with the elbow sticking straight up.  Shift the right foot up a few inches to a good foothold.  Release the right hand from the gaston to reach the right hand again high to a sloping edge feature.  The middle, index and pinky fingers should go on a three finger tiny diagonal crimp that lies over a subtle sloper, while the index finger alone grabs a tiny edge that faces  diagonally but at a 90 degree angle change from the other fingers, kind of like a star.      Keep tension and reach the left hand to a broken, third pad left facing sidepull edge with a bit of an incut.  This hold is one of those that broke, but what is left now is fairly solid and good.  Stand up high and run the feet up and left a bit so you can bust the right hand to the good flat lip.  From here it is over, get the left hand up to a hold just beneath the lip and mantel with the right leg.      The whole idea of this bloc is tension.  The holds are poor and none of the moves are particularly long.  It is just about making intermediate movements between bad holds that all face the wrong way.  If one of your appendages does not execute correctly or loses contact with the rock for more than a second, you are off.    All in all, this is a cool problem and you will feel great if you can figure it out.  It seems so simple upon first glance, but is much more difficult than it appears.  The slash grade comes from it being V8 if the features and length between the holds fit you, which seems to be about 5'11'' +/- one inch.  If you are shorter like me at 5'7'', it seems harder.  I don't know about tall guys over 6 foot.  They may have an even easier time on it.","{200073655: 4, 109522593: 4, 111383595: 3, 109017735: 3, 106469275: 2, 109473356: 2, 200371244: 2}"

It is certainly the most serious highball in all of Mt. Gretna.  Joel Brady caused quite a stir among us locals when he completed this long eyed project during a visit around 2004.  Not only is it incredibly highball and proud, but a pointed rock lies embedded in the ground directly underneath the fall zone.      Start standing and climb up to a flat jug on the corner around ten feet up.  Take a deep breath, then begin the horrifying journey up the next fifteen feet through rarely traveled terrain.  The right face is flaky and not the best rock quality.  On the plus side, it is peppered with tiny flaky edges.  The upper portion appears to utilize the arete for both hands in some spots, and the left hand on the arete with right hand on edges on the right face in other areas.      It would be prudent to clean the rock on toprope before attempting, as I am certain the climb has not been tired in quite some time.  Better yet, work the boulder on a top rope before bouldering it out.  Think of it as a headpoint.  Or the best idea may be to skip this climb and move on to a problem that will not risk broken ankles or worse.      If you send this boulder, you have serious street cred in my mind.  I imagine it has seen only a handful of ascents in the ten years after its first ascent.  The Brady Arete is one of the most risky undertakings that I have seen out of all of the diabase areas, save for a few of Char's creations at Haycock.  Only The Yosemite Crack (V10) at Haycock comes to mind as a rival in terms of height and fall potential.","{106469275: 2, 200362426: 2, 111692889: 2}"

It climbs the subtle sloping lip of a steep roof and in true diabase style; surprisingly finicky and technical despite the severe overhang.  A testament to Chet's ability to envision problems from seemingly unclimbable features.      Start sitting on the rail.  Heel hook and head for the triangle shaped hold, which is more of a feature than a hold, that you will utilize for both hands in the near future.  This problem will work your right hamstring.  Get established on this hold (will help if it is cold and not humid), match with a gaston-ish meat wrap grip and make a dynamic move to snag the two and a half finger crimp.  Now you need to attain the sidepull/crack/fingerlock thing with a go-again.  A tiny foot lies far under the overhang for the left foot to aid in the transition between crimp and crack.      The crux is over, toe hook the left foot on the starting rail which will allow you to hook your right heel over your hand (probably the only time I have ever had to do this on diabase) to grope the right hand up your choice of a blank wall around the corner or a sharp arete, aiming for the apex of the arete with the top of the boulder that forms a nice pinch.  A right knee scum is possible.  Pull around the right face, traverse the lip and topout.  This problem has been done as an eliminate without using the crack and is most likely V9 that way.        Trickle in Time is the problem that almost everyone considers the benchmark for V8 at Mt. Gretna.  It is a problem that feels impossible until one works out the subtitles.  In optimal conditions with low temperature and humidity, this problem feels easier. (in my opinion it could be a sandbag V6 at one or two granite bouldering areas I can think of).

The jammy part is pretty casual because the ground follows you up as you climb out of the hole so the fall isn't much of a concern; the layback however has the potential to dissect you in half should you peel off.

Technical, physical, involved and committing, this problem embodies everything of Mount Gretna and the rock type.  The sit start to the Prow is my all time favorite diabase boulder problem out of all areas in Pennsylvania, a state I was born in and never left until the age of 20.  I grew up on Mount Gretna Road, just a ten minute drive from the main boulder field.  I have a special connection with this problem. The stand start at a stiff V5 was one of my first V5's.  I completed the sit start to The Prow on April 1, 2003.  I remember that day vividly.  It was one of the first advanced boulder problems I had ever completed, both mentally and physically.  It took me probably 7 to 10 visits to do the stand start, and by the time I was working the sit start full line a season later I was doing the stand three to five times in a day in preparation.    I understand that now a hold has broken and it is most certainly the crucial left hand half pad three finger sidepull crimp that has enlarged.  The stand start is a sandbag or solid at the grade at V5.  Right hand up anywhere you want on the arete, scrunch up, and highstep onto the blade.  The right foot will be smearing on a downsloping feature, if it blows you will graze your shin on the underside of the roof.  A large deadpoint for a one pad left hand sidepull immediately follows.  It is the largest hold on the problem but is utilized for a very short period of time.  Delicately balance your way around the right arete after more slapping, 1/3 pad sidepulls and a high right foot smear.  There are at least three ways to get to the lip; technical and in control, shouldery and barndoorish, or all out dyno.  I prefer the former.      For the full V7 or V8 sit start line that nearly doubles the length and quality of the problem, start underneath the roof blade in a true sit start and work around left on solid, almost one pad crimps.  Make a very strenuous pull from a three finger three quarter pad left hand sidepull and grope up and right on the arete to a veiny pinch and swing both feet up and to the right.  It may help to be short on this sequence because it is so scrunchy.  High step like you would off of the ground to begin the stand start then execute the above.","{106469275: 4, 200794362: 4, 200362426: 3, 110746025: 2}"

He has put up many of the best problems-especially the technical ones- (like 50-100) in this main area and at the surrounding satellite areas.      The climb begins sitting or crouching with hands on a large hold on the left end of the boulder.  Some people will do a kind of standing start but with hands still on the hold.  For full value, start sitting.  Mantel this hold and reach up with the left hand to a huge sloper on a bulge.  Slap around on this large feature and lean way right to grab a crimpy, inset seam which shoots straight right for ten feet.  Getting established with both hands on the seam from the basketball sloper is probably the most difficult individual move, but every following move requires nearly similar exertion.  Tick tac right along the crimpy seam with zero footholds.  Your feet will be pawing on a steep wall for worthless smears with your butt out.  After a handful of moves, you will have gained the right side of the boulder where you can mantel on a sloping lip.      Joel used to make this problem look graceful, and I made it look thrutchy.

Negotiate the blank bottom of the hanging, ever-so-slightly slabby face and pull into the shallow tips crack using crimpy flakes.

Jugarete,108567334.0,Boulder,107420046.0,V5-6,12.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,"Not to take away from Seth Derr's description of the Jugarete Traverse, I would like to add more to it.  This problem has it all: history, a striking feature, adequate holds, height, continuity of movement and a bit of spice!    The Jugarete can be climbed two ways.  The right (direct) way is to hop up to the wide horizontal rail on the hanging arete and slap up to two small finger bumps at the lip of the beach ball slab above while squeezing the arete with your feet or using a tiny chip to keep the feet from swinging off.  Claw your way blindly up to a crimp edge or two mid way up the bulge.  Get your feet underneath you on the starting rail and mantel with your heart in your throat.  This way is V5 or perhaps a tad harder, but probably not V6.  This is a standard sandbag at the Stables.  It would be prudent to get on top of the boulder and locate and chalk the holds prior to launching off, and the holds are hard to see.    The left version of Jugarete is to hop up to the rail, get the bumps at the lip of the slab, and then start working the hands left along the rising sloping lip rather than topping out directly above.  After slapping away left, you will end up with the left hand on a sloper and the right on a faint edge on the sloping lip.  There is a foothold far below on the face that may be used if you are lengthy.  Get the right foot up as a toe perch or heel hook and mantel, again in terror.  The intended problem is to not traverse all the way left into the huge horizontal jug that is at the top of the Juggernaut dihedral crack, though in theory this is possible.  This variation is about V6, but probably not V7.  Both ways of doing this problem are high quality and climb quite well.     The Jugarete traverse sit starts with hands on a huge plate on the overhanging wall eight feet to the right of the arete.  This is the start to Huck (V4).  Make long moves, traversing left to a wide rail, and then again left to gain the starting rail of the Jugarete.  You could top out on the right Jugarete problem for the traverse, but the intended path is to top out on the Jugarete left variation.  The full traverse is about V7, probably not V8 and is one of the longest overhanging problems I have seen at any diabase area.  It might be neat to traverse all the way into the finish of the Juggernaut crack and top out on that problem, adding a few feet but perhaps subtracting some difficulty, as you would avoid the crux mantel of Jugarete left.  My above description sounds contrived, but there are almost no extraneous holds and all of the variations are relatively easy to decipher.           I have always thought that a sick lower standing start could be done on the hanging arete.  It would be necessary to pinch the arete at a nice, acute depression and undercling the right hand underneath the roof of the boulder far below.  You would be very stretched out with the hands, and there are virtually no footholds, save for one measly wart.  I suspect this obvious start to this classic, tall and proud line would be no easier than V11 and perhaps even V12.",{106469275: 4}

It is also one of the best problems at any diabase area in Pennsylvania, including Mount Gretna and Haycock.  I think it is one of the top five V9's in Pennsylvania, encompassing all rock types and styles.      Begin this challenging problem on the right side of the 45 degree overhang on a good underclings with smears for the feet.  Bust the right hand up to a flat hold that is exactly vertical just to stall on it, finagle the left hand into the best part of the undercling starting handhold, and then slap the right hand again to the sloping lip.  Toe hook so you can release the left hand and attain the lip.  These are very powerful moves.  Keeping the feet tight so you don't dab on the ground that parallels the overhang is difficult.    Now the real fun starts.  Heel hook with the right leg, and figure out how to mantel the extremely sloping lip.  The mantel is the crux alone and is at least V8 or even V9. You will need some serious strength and skill to get on top of this boulder.  Prepare to scrape the inside of your right ankle, perhaps many times.  This mantel is far more difficult than the crux mantel on Two Pop (V9, initially rated V10) at Lost Cove, in Boone, North Carolina.  In fact, it is the most difficult mantel I have ever encountered outside of Pawtuckaway, New Hampshire and Little Cottonwood Canyon, Utah; and those were rated V10 and V11.  Many folks will feel sandbagged by the grade.  To add insult to injury, I think Dr. Torretti thought the problem in it's entirety was about V8!  Good hip flexibility will be a boon on this mantel.     Pull, press and rock over onto the flat top.  This is a full on mantel.

Match on this two handed hold using a bicycle move with the feet (the pedal move) and then grab up to the lip and mantel.  This bloc is demanding, powerful and quite obvious.

Short and Inflexible,112540507.0,Boulder,112118587.0,V3,10.0,1.0,3.5,2.0,"Starts off on a little ledge. If you're short (like me), dyno for the second hand hold. Smear with your right foot and stem with your left. Finish is tricky, as you have to grab a not so obvious pinch/undercling to shift your balance for the top out.","{200309837: 4, 111011773: 3}"

End Wall,111632079.0,Boulder,111632053.0,V1,10.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,"Easy route, a few pinches. The one rock looks sketchy, but in reality is very stable. most challenging part is popping up through the Rhododendron bush at the top of the route.",{111011773: 3}

It's found at the end of the cliff, around the corner from End Wall (V1). follows a crack line up some crazy features eroded into the sandstone.

Shit!,112470426.0,Trad,111632053.0,5.9,25.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"The route follows a series of huecos up the face to a large ledge, then traverses over to the end of Cold Shut (5.8). The crux comes in the first ten feet, before the ledge. Very small footholds and slippery handholds (we did it while it was raining), along with mud on the ledge just compounds the difficulty of the route. IF TOPROPING WITH COLD SHUT ANCHOR: BE CAREFUL.
