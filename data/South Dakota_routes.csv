Spire One East Chimney,106501876,Trad,105714327,5.7+,200,3,3.1,38.0,"This route takes the squeeze chimney (see photo) on the east side of Spire 1 all the way up to about ten feet below the big ledge with the bolts for the first belay.  The remaining pitches follow the standard path around the ledges and back again as follows:    Pitch 1:  110 feet, narrow chimney (5.7+) -- The chimney has great crystals/friction for climbing, but squeezes you very tight about 40 feet up and then it's a real grunt from there for the next 30 feet.  I walked up a big #5 camalot for protection in this tight section.  The rest of the chimney can be protected with cams from #1 to #4.  Ten feet below the fist belay ledge the chimney ends, and you step left and do an easy face climb to the ledge.  Two new bolts with a chain are about chest level, eight feet to the right of where you top out on the large ledge.  You end up directly above the start of the chimney.      Pitch 2:  25 feet, 5.3 -- from the belay bolts at the top of pitch one, work your way around the ledge to the right (facing the rock) 180 degrees to the opposite side.  Set a comfortable trad belay with cams from #1 to #3 at the base of a large flake.        Pitch 3:  50 feet, 5.7 -- This is a fun, short pitch with fantastic exposure.  Climb 8 feet up the flake and set a piece of protection, make a very exposed (5.7) long step right to another flake/small ledge where you can set more protection, then take a small step across to the main rock and scramble fifteen feet up an exposed face (5.5) with nice holds/feet.  There's an old piton at the top of the face scramble wedged beneath the summit block.  Clip the piton (or place a cam) as a directional for your follower, then work back left on the upper ledge all the way back around the summit block 180 degrees (easy, but no hands really).  You will end up about 40 feet directly above the 1st belay station bolts.  Again there are two new bolts and a chain about chest high on the rock for this belay.    (Pitch 4 -- Summit Block):  12 feet, 5.3 -- easy climb up the moderate angle wide crack to top of the summit block.  Enjoy an amazing view (see photo), then downclimb back to the bolts (there is no hardware on top of the summit block).    Descent:  Two rappels gets you back to the start of the chimney.  The first rappel is about 40 feet down from the upper bolts to the big ledge with the lower bolts directly beneath.  The second rappel is about 110 feet from the pitch 1 bolts to the start of the route.  If you don't have a 70M rope, then you will need TWO ROPES for the bottom rappel.    NOTE:  I used a 70M rope and it just barely reached the ground with about 4 feet to spare.  If you don't have a 70M rope, you will need  a DOUBLE-ROPE rappel to get down from the big ledge to the base.    Overall this was a great climb.  I loved how it wound it's way around the rock to the other side, then back again.  The squeeze chimney is very tight in places, but I still highly recommend this climb.","{108799569: 4, 107591659: 4, 105966977: 4, 111790531: 4, 108356080: 4, 110806646: 4, 106273621: 4, 109639865: 4, 112512912: 3, 107697400: 3, 107610587: 3, 200146694: 3, 108856432: 3, 109340784: 3, 110914708: 3, 111090029: 3, 107785600: 3, 107525760: 3, 200417763: 3, 109305902: 3, 107572777: 3, 12985: 3, 105828891: 3, 106558554: 3, 105829183: 3, 107080237: 3, 106237951: 3, 107468926: 3, 106945872: 3, 107027962: 3, 108121274: 3, 106398311: 3, 107132514: 3, 106228321: 2, 107328579: 2, 107639626: 2, 107786364: 2, 200533304: 1}"

There is really very little protectable surface area here and no way to make an anchor at the end of this 5th class scramble. Climbers should be competent at soloing.

A large flaring crack takes a fist sized cam and a bit of a runout on small chicken heads leads to a finger crack. This finger crack has killer holds and takes bomber gear. Use small C3's and small nuts. There is a rusty, old bolt on this pitch that should be backed up with very small cams and micro-stoppers.

From here, I believe that the original route must traverse further right, but most people go straight up the insipient crack/groove to the summit.

After drilling the last bolt, Pete thought that there would be a bomber hand hold above from which he could drill an additional bolt, which turned out to be false.    A great view of climbers on this route can be had from the summit of the Hitching Post or the Thimble.","{105873653: 4, 106104076: 3, 106597548: 3, 14120: 2}"

Original Route,109353112,Trad,105714630,5.9+,130,1,4.0,10.0,"The original route tackles the obvious crack system on the Northwest side of the formation. One of the guidebooks I looked at gives this one a 5.9++, which is a grading system I'm not familiar with but as far as I can tell equates to roughly 5.10c in the Yosemite Decimal System. (for posterity, I've maintained the 5.9+ grade here for this route listing).    Don't worry though, you get the crux out of the way right in the beginning as you tackle an overhanging bulge with long reaches between flared jams and handholds. Then angle left along a handcrack to reach a fist to offwidth size flake. There's a stardrive bolt here which unbelievably had a bail biner on it, so you know that sucker is at least good for body weight! After that is a tricky transition to another crack out right, then more steep climbing with some stemming past an old set of bolts to a new set of bolts w/chains about 15' below the summit.    You can go to the top in one pitch by continuing straight up the chimney, or you can do a second short easy 5th class pitch up a ramp around right (this is the way you'll be climbing back down to the rap anchor, since there is no anchor on top). To descend make a rappel from the chains with either two ropes or one 70m rope (the ends of our 70 were swayin' in the wind when we started the rappel, but with rope stretch they just barely touched down by the end).    This is a fantastic route that has it all - excellent sustained crack climbing, radically steep and exposed, great rock, a beautiful freestanding formation, cool summit, and this line is basically the only way to the top unless you climb like really, REALLY hard stuff.

At the top of the slab/ramp, it continues to the right in an ascending traverse through a series of large, wildly-shaped wind-eroded holds.

I occasionally toproped it, but did not come back for a free ascent until this year.  My son did it free when we were there in May, but it sounds like it had been freed by others before that.  Either way it is a very fun route and a good decent from the really nice Conn Route on that formation. It also makes a good TR if you would like to try it out before getting on lead.  It was quite dirty when I first lead it, but I did clean it up some then. We cleaned it up a lot more in May as it had been a few years since I had been on it so it is in really good shape now.  I originally thought it was about 5.8 A2 as the crack was fairly dirty and not that easy to protect.  You have to free climb the last 20-25 feet past the bolt on really good rock that is well featured but fairly steep. The holds are spaced fairly far at the start of the face climbing so it is a nice 5.8 finish past the 5.10 crux.  Now I think it would be more like 5.8 A1 or 10a if you have to free climb it haha.     ","{105920778: 4, 105865653: 4, 110814240: 4}"

The rock is bombproof, bulletproof and of exceptional quality. Everything you grab and step on is solid.  The second best thing about the rock is its location, ten minutes of hiking on an easy trail and you're there. Aspiring hard men and hard women will seek this one out. With this route you can warm up on Goldstone's Riddle, rap down, preplace draws and then top rope and headpoint until competency and fitness are achieved.  The millennials are going to want to be able to lead at their limit. The interesting thing about this climb is the tricky business is found somewhere between the ground and somewhere above the third bolt. With enough practice and rope work a newly minted intermediate climber with a body meant for glory - but a head space meant for easier climbs - would be able to pull the rope and have a top rope set up at the third bolt. And with enough practice and persistence they could then go through the second, eventually the first, and then, when they are good and ready, they could finally start their lead from the ground, without draws already hanging, and safely send. If you are an aspiring 5.11 leader who has crushed a bunch of routes lower in the grade range, you should think about the tenants of outdoor safety, since this is a route that demands a perfect athletic sense of balance and strength. There is a good chance that you could fall anywhere on the route.  But worry not, another good thing about the route is the bolting which is definitely Needles style, just taken down a notch. The climbing from the ground all the way to the anchors is sustained, engaging, quite pumpy and if you've never climbed the grade before this route might make you poop your pants just a little. It does ease off just before the anchors but expect most moves on the route to be steep, most of the big holds will be slopey and most of the really good holds will be crimps.  Think about moving right, to holds right of the bolt line, when you get towards the top. This is where the holds appear to go left, but the climbing goes right.  This route will allow someone to gradually up the challenge and better their game. Which is exactly what we need now at Custer State Park.

After the rurp, head out left along a seam which brings you to pins. From the pins, head up to a set of bolts and fiddle in lots of gear. After a pin is clipped move up a bit higher and place a high piece. This high piece is good. Move left (crux). After this final traverse is done; it's easy sailin to the top. As for the top out, work around and left at the top.  (History of one the hardest summits in the Black Hills) Renn Fenton was the first person to scope out the line. He believed that it would go and even listed out the cruxes and belays. His beta proved to be mostly spot on for the FA group. This spire was put up in 1979 before there was right and wrong ways to climbing such as Redpointing and Pinkpointing. The FA was done as a group and in Yo-Yo style because of the uncertainty, style and grade of the climb. The FA party all took 30 plus foot rides trying to figure out the upper cruxes. Finally, Paul Muehl put two RURPS in the rock above the first crux on the second pitch. The first one was met to slow down the falling climber enough to have the second one hold for a better fall than before. Kevin Bein pulled the first one out on a fall and the second one held. Kevin continued climbing the traverse and pounding in two pitons. It is said that Kevin Bein did a series of One arm pullups across the traverse and made it past the two upper cruxes.

I had not been on this route since doing the first ascent some 20 years ago. I just repeated the route a few weeks ago and think it is a good quality route, with typical classic Needles Spice!! It is a bit committing & a little hairy leading past the bolt but the fall would be clean.     Just some background history. It was climbed around 1984 by Charlie Fowler & myself  from the ground up with no previous knowledge and never reported, that I know of, until now. We had not done the other route on the Nail or rapped and previewed this route. I was looking for an FA to do in this area & chose the line, lead up and laboriously placed the bolt on lead and then came down for a rest. I let Charlie go up while I rested, which may or may not have been a mistake, depending on how you look at it. He got to lead the spicy section above the bolt on the first ascent. It climbs the obvious crack/flake that ends one third of the way up the east face.  Start up the slightly overhanging discontinous crack with friends for protection to start and small nuts and RP's for pro at the top of the crack.    Climb the crack to it's end. Make moves left to a bolt/placed on lead. Then climb hard, scary moves up and then left to easier ground and join the Cerberus route at its last bolt before the summit.  Finish on the last few feet of Cerberus.    I just repeated the route recently and found the original bolt I placed in 1984 still there! Hopefully someone will find the route worthy and upgrade the bolt at some point in the future as it would not be good if this bolt failed in the event of a fall as it is very old.

Around 2011 the Stump was removed and for about a year it lay next to this climb as climbers who couldn't get established would grab the stump and place it back in the whole as a cheater start. I'm guessing the stump has now been completely dissolved. Work a series of side pulls and underclings. Smearing is key with the feet. This problem is one of the few in Palisades that actually gets good friction with the feet. ,"{106725656: 4, 106860379: 4, 107471182: 4, 106701059: 3, 106558554: 3, 106860947: 2}"

The more centered (to the right) in the dihedral you stay the more difficult this route will be.    It is possible to bail left out of the dihedral at the pine tree. This variation is about 5.10c/d and features an independent more direct bolted finish up a slab and ove a roof. This variation is named ""Cooling Relief"".

The top offers a choice between an oddly tilted slab/arête and a tight chimney. Quite contrived and a bit confusing. Most climbers will probably start to the right, in the chimney, and then cross over to the slab- but it could work the other way as well. You could also stay left or right nearly the whole way, but you would have to leave the right hand chimney (not pleasant anyway) to tackle the final awkward bulge that guards the  anchors (which is easier if you go , you guessed it, back right!).

Its line follows the zigzagging cracks to the flake's left passing bolts at otherwise unprotectable areas,and through the improbable bulge and another bolt, after the crack hooks back right and ends. There are extremely solid anchors on the wall above the bulge and another pitch is intended up the shallow crack system/groove to its right. The climbing is, for the most part,progressively more difficult,technical,strenuous, and balancey. The most serious fall can take place just before reaching the second bolt if good enough gear has not been placed in the barn-door layback section,and has been taken with no injury. The last bolt is high and hard to clip but you wouldn't want it any lower as you reach the anchor. The first and third bolts and anchor were placed on rappel and are the only ones I've placed that way, thus the route name. The route was led from the ground in twelve tries with two top-roped attempts somewhere in the middle of those. I wonder if I'll ever be able to do it again.

Pluto's Playground,117542970,Sport,105714345,5.9+,65,1,2.0,2.0,"Pluto's Playground  is essentially the 2nd pitch of a two-pitch sport route that starts with Make Believe. This upper pitch, which starts out of a gulley above Make Believe that eventually heads downhill toward SLAMAT and Moonstone, doesn't seem to see a lot of traffic, and we kept kicking micro pebbles off it. Nonetheless, the rock quality and movement are quite good. The route features some bigger, steeper moves that utilize positive knobs, crimps, and dishes. There are a couple thoughtful blank slabby friction sections as well (one of which is probably the crux).The difficulty of a somewhat bouldery start could be eased by stemming off the fin that constitutes the top of Make Believe. The 5.9+ rating of Pluto's Playground  might seem a bit soft (it actually seemed a touch easier than the sandbagged Make Believe) compared to other 5.9+ climbs at the rather stiffly-graded Magna Carta crag, but would be quite on the mark elsewhere at Rushmore. I decided to list the R safety rating for this route that I think was in the old Phinney guidebook as opposed to the PG13 in the more modern Busse and Burr version. While most of this route is well-bolted, there was a runout slabby section that was not entirely trivial. A fall there could well result in the leader falling on top of the belayer, decking in the gulley, or getting impaled on the fin at the top of Make Believe . Any of those possibilities would make for a bad day indeed... in addition to the fact that any stricken leader would be around 100 feet above the ground.","{108121274: 2, 107417154: 2}"

Weird Water,105714749,Trad,105714345,5.7,140,1,3.7,98.0,"A great, long climb.  Incredible moves, incredible position.  This route summits the main rock in the Marker formation.  Gets my vote for the best 5.7 in Rushmore!    Finding this route the first time around can be a bit of a chore...  Follow directions to the route 'Star Dancer'.  As you're looking at the rock, scramble up to the right, passing the first gully on the left, into a small opening / grassy area, and continue to the next gully on the left.  At the top of this gully are some large blocks / chockstones.    After surmounting the blocks, continue on to the right until just past the chimney on left (the Gilson Chimney).  The various starts for Weird Water begin here.  The variations on the start range from 5.2 (traversing up and right to the main line - 2 bolts) to 5.10 (direct start with a couple bolts).  The line I'll describe is the trad start and keeps the entire route at 5.7.    After scoping out the direct start, look to the finger-type crack a couple feet to the right.  Climb the crack, protecting to your comfort level (stoppers work well).  The crack ends at a small shelf after about 25'.  I found a nice placement for a 1"" cam at the back of the small shelf.    From the shelf, pick out the biggest crystals and move left and up to the first bolt.  I found these moves to be a bit nervy.  From that point on, continue from bolt to bolt, being careful to follow the bolt line as it moves to the right (direct up the water streak is 'Weird Dripper').  If you pick a direct line between each bolt you can make this climb much more difficult.    After finally reaching the top you'll find a small summit and a two bolt anchor.  Enjoy the views, tie your ropes together, and rap down.","{107621985: 4, 105828891: 4, 107650191: 4, 10535: 4, 111252595: 4, 106216128: 4, 111347304: 4, 108799569: 4, 110052498: 4, 106701059: 4, 108121274: 4, 109639865: 4, 108679988: 4, 106661800: 4, 108588676: 4, 106564832: 4, 107206763: 4, 107568149: 4, 109130361: 4, 107378510: 4, 111050645: 4, 111855857: 4, 107652586: 4, 200209123: 4, 108478944: 4, 200236802: 4, 107821162: 4, 111656276: 4, 110726946: 4, 110331803: 4, 110814240: 4, 108425823: 4, 12690: 4, 110700545: 4, 109029609: 4, 113168176: 4, 112014548: 4, 112446503: 4, 110471529: 4, 108172485: 4, 109483574: 4, 200914792: 4, 10124: 4, 106913008: 4, 11341: 4, 107697400: 4, 106029096: 4, 10270: 4, 105829183: 4, 105835689: 4, 14674: 4, 13248: 4, 106558554: 4, 107080237: 4, 106983273: 4, 105790589: 4, 11453: 4, 10915: 4, 11725: 4, 106237951: 4, 106388352: 4, 108024564: 4, 106878689: 4, 106813582: 4, 106889145: 4, 105966977: 4, 106503119: 4, 106460214: 4, 108251742: 4, 106521354: 4, 107027962: 4, 108096660: 4, 14558: 4, 106697782: 4, 10246: 3, 107475383: 3, 111752519: 3, 106386299: 3, 200564551: 3, 106209198: 3, 108392797: 3, 106354287: 3, 106273621: 3, 106578430: 3, 107533223: 3, 105949578: 3, 110304423: 3, 11759: 3, 111855853: 3, 110414401: 3, 105939597: 3, 12985: 3, 105888978: 3, 109340784: 3, 200286943: 3, 108506531: 3, 110975596: 2, 10335: 2}"

Rarely, such gambles pay off and you find something at least ok to pretty good (like the route Tenuous for me on Veiny recently) ... other times you experience something like this. First the good: The climbing on the top of Belmont Brie is really engaging. Steep sustained 5.9 crimping through rolling bulges with good rock quality and interesting holds. Otherwise, this thing has a lot of drawbacks. First of all, the guidebook 5.8 rating is a bit sandbagged. Taking everything into account, I would rate it 5.9+. The bottom has suspect rock quality and lots of slick lichen on it. The middle of the route is a total chossy mess. Protection on the route is unreliable, the bolting is bizarre, and the anchors are suspect. In its current condition, this route should probably be avoided.     If you do decide to give this thing a try...To start, cautiously ascend a shallow dihedral to the right with delicate footwork on lichen-slick rock to the first bolt. You will discover that most of the 8 bolts here are loose spinning buttonheads-- really unreliable in the case of a lead fall. Bolts 2 and 3 are also inexplicably way off line to the left (what the first ascentionists were thinking here, I'm not sure... Was the rock quality better in 1989? Were they trying to avoid extending a draw for some reason?). To clip or clean these bolts requires awkward destabilizing lunges out onto crumbling, featureless lichen-covered rock. The middle section is slightly steeper with less lichen and the bolt line back where it should be , but the rock quality deteriorates further. Holds flex, and the belayer will probably feel like an extra in the Mel Gibson movie THE PATRIOT as musket-ball shaped chunks of rocks will fall upon him/her with greater rapidity than your average Revolutionary War Hessian trooper could fire! Then the pretty darn good top, followed by the decayed ""roll the dice"" disaster that are the anchors. My partner (who backed up the anchor to lower me) and I both sent this thing cleanly, and he won the rappel lottery.

Lucky you clipped an extended draw for the first bolt. Move out right across no hands but good smears if your into that kind of thing.

A cool rock graced with an incredible route.  Very popular and deservedly so.    Gossamer climbs the right side of the fin / arete up to, beside, and over the hole (picture window) in the rock.  The start is a bit of an awkward (yet easy) move up to a block and the start of the fin.  As the ground drops off beneath the climb, it is wise to protect the first moves with a stopper (#10 BD?) or cam.    Once on the block, layback the fin, and start moving up clipping the bolts.  With each move, the angle of the fin lessens and makes things just a bit easier.  Once at the apex of the rock, you'll find 2 'quick clip' type anchors - slip the rope in & get lowered to the ground.  Because of the nature of the route, it needs to be seconded to be cleaned, and rigging a TR wouldn't really work.

Crawl up the small crimpers and awkward balancy moves to a small roof.  After the roof the climb backs of to 5.9-5.10 climbing.  But until after the fifth bolt the climb is on you with the smallest crimper I've ever felt on a 5.11--and you'll use it to clip!  You don't have to clip off of, but it makes the climb that much more interesting.      When I climbed this on 06/10/2003, I broke off THREE holds, and one of them is a crucial left hand after the fourth bolt.  I'm not sure if this bumps the grade up a letter, but it's a smaller hold now (three or four fingers, half pad to two fingers, half pad) at the start of a small sequence to clip the fifth bolt.

Start on the obvious hold down low. Work up and left using edges and odd feet. The crux of this problem is keeping your feet on. If they cut they will hit the boulder behind you taking weight off of the arms and preventing you from possibly barn dooring off. Finish up by the loose block on top.

Pinch a loaf.    Short, powerful and strangely satisfying if you have a fetish for this sort of thing.

The crux is on crimps and gets really sick when you grab a lincoln log of a gastone. Gain high feet and rock up to a shitty intermediate left hand hold.

As of Spring 2014 there are now 7 high quality routes on this fun as heck wall.    This fine line is the third route form the left. It is located smack dab up against a large, rectangular black rock that jets on out of the ledge  which makes up this wall. Belayers should try their best to stand behind this blocky obstruction since standing on top of it just ain't a good idea.    This route is awesome! It has magnificent pocket pulling and works its way up to a blank, black face with a seriously thought provoking and burley move to get to the anchors.

Fact or Friction,107101166,Sport,106292490,5.10a,60,1,1.5,6.0,"Dear Abby,    My wife and I got into rock climbing a year ago, thinking it would be a great activity we would enjoy together. We started climbing 5.6's 7's 8's and I thought I was on top of the world when I onsighted my first 5.9 plus. When I ventured into the 5.10's I found myself unable to climb with the same rate of success as those lower grades. She soon wasn't satisfied with climbing routes like ""Preperation H"" and ""ToyBoat"", I kept begging my wife to keep her ambitions low, since climbing should be done with caution and one should not ""grade-chase"" since that could lead to disaster. But now she's left me for a guy who looks like Fabio and climbs like Sharma. I feel like a failure and haven't even had the motivation to even climb out of bed. What should I do?    Belayerless in Seatle.    Dear Belayerless,    First of all, have you given any thought to the fact that mullets are to be caught with a rod and reel instead of worn as a hairsyle? Have you considered the fact that goatee makes it appear as if you have a vagina on your face? Maybe the woman that used to hold your rope was trying to teach you something. While even climbs lower in the grading scale should be respected, early in your climbing career, you may feel a certain endorphine rush from onsighting ""easier"" climbs. This feeling is soon lost when you start to experience failure, but ask any climber like Chris Sharma, the bitter taste of failure is necessary to make you a better climber and let the successes you achieve in the higher grades taste all that more sweet. If you ever find a lady willing to belay your sorry ass again, I suggest this 5.10a as the perfect means to get used to feeling failure and going through the ""project phase"" all climbers need to overcome before they send. This climb starts off easy and gets harder and harder and more and more mentally challenging the higher you climb. Bring a bail beaner, a good attitude and a willingness to try, try again. Once you get past a climb like this, the success you once felt will come to you, even though the girl of your dreams might not.",{200661637: 0}

Heavy metal and glam rock were a huge part of my life (still is) and to have an entire wall devoted to the music that made my adolescence tolerable is quite an honor. But Super Atomic Night Shirt? Who the hell are they? Of course, there were a billion of these bands during the 80's and 90's that had one hit on the Head Banger's Ball and then faded off into obscurity. They played a club, got a record contract, became addicted to drugs, went bankrupt and some of them get to play the state fair every once in a while.

What the hell was that all about anyway? I remember winning Pearl Jam's Ten CD at my Senior Prom. For some strange reason, at the time, listening to that album caused me to burn all my hair metal tapes and made me want to wear flannels.

Starts on a stair-like section of pink rock that kicks back into extremely overhung territory. The opening crux moves begin on something that can only be described as a ""feature"". The crux is getting around, over, and through this blocky, roof-like obstruction. Use and abuse an odd barrage of holds that range from huge, to weird, to awkward, to super-sick (but hilariously shitty) all at the same time. Your chance of success depends on how much of a weakling you are and how well you get your baby-butt soft hands to stick to these strange, yet delicious holds.    Man handle that rock! Scream at those holds! To get yourself over this feature requires a body builder's strength and a contortionist's coordination. The moves you must stick perfectly include a right hand pinch on a loaf, a left hand in a weird position in a sick undercling, a foot way out right, and a left foot stuck in a dish and then moved to a crack all combined with a huge full body huck to a hidden jug above. This completely anaerobic set of starting moves tends to make the uninitiated quite short of breath right away, leading to a flash pump from hell right off the bat.     Sound like fun? Keep climbing. Once you get past the opening sequence (pumped out of your mind) the rest of the climb is huge, sweet jugs thrown in with a combination of moves (that are by no means rocket science) to another series of moves that are a bit pumpy. Some middle sections of the route might freak you out simply because you are so pumped from the flail-fest that you probably experienced down low.    Some locals have described this climb as the ugly, twin sister of a super-sick, classic climb in the Big Picture Gully known as Quest For Fire. While the climbing is sick and classic for the full length of Pulmonary Suprema the pump is actually manageable (if you milk rests for all they are worth) making Pulmonary a bit less of a challenge compared to  other Spearfish Canyon climbs in the 5.11c range. This, plus the fact that many a climber has been so frustrated by the opening moves of this climb that they never get on it again gives it three stars. Yes...it is unfortunate. It seems that a high level of lameness, by a group of visiting climbers, from some place in this country, that is populated by puds, has doomed what should be a classic climb to a mere three star status.    Don't that deter you! Get on this thing! Acclimate yourself to the concept of the high altitude huck and get in shape, you freaking weenies! In the 1960's, when Kennedy was banging Marilyn Monroe, over 60% of all Americans could do at least 10 pull ups. By the time Reagan took office, and ketchup was considered a vegetable for school lunch, only about 30% of the population could do 10 pull ups without ending up looking like a total pud. WHAT IS YOUR EXCUSE?!    The bottom line is this climb is probably sandbagged and its difficulty is completely dependent upon how much you suck.

This is a super fun, highly-intelligent, tech-nasty route just to the left of Iron Horse. The climbing starts on a bumpy bulge and has the climber thinking about how to stop a fall (dead in its tracks) just a few moves off the deck. Tricky side pulls and weird holds lead to a nice, two-finger pocket punch from high feet that seem to grind you to a halt. And while battling the first three bolts of the climb is probably the most interesting crux, more and more super-cool climbing awaits when this lower black panel of rock runs out of steam.     What must have been the original route ends after an overhung slab of black rock. The climbing quickly brings you to a strange land of flakes and rock formations that look chossy as shit, but trust me, every aspect of the rock is totally solid and trustworthy. Make a bunch of awesomely awkward moves on ridiculously-strange fun holds. Move up a belly to an overhung black bulge where a tossing crux finishes a series of moves that might have you falling many times before you figure out the sequence that makes it easy and efficient.    After a somewhat nail-biting first go, I can see why the original developer backed off on the upper section. However, even though the rock looks funky and strange (when compared to the bullet-proof beginning) the climbing past the first three bolts is actually very awesome with many moves and holds that might having you edging your toe into classic territory. A few yucky holds at the beginning, middle and end, make the rock quality three star, but overall the entire route is funtastic, well-bolted, and begs to become a project for the five eleven climber who wants to push into upper grades soon. If you are a fan of Engine No. 9, then you better get on The Brakeman.

All Strikes. No Balls.,112457074,Sport,107360742,5.12b,100,1,4.0,3.0,"Yet another worthy five twelve something climb that every five twelve climber should get on. Shares the same five elevenie first pitch with Around The Horn. As you will recall, most of us experience the first stopper crux of this route at a left leaning tugger/mugger move at the fourth bolt that robs you of good feet when you are terribly pumped. Expect the same deal to go down here. Another pumpy crux awaits after a brief/thin rest that involves using a full value five eleven plus crimper to good feet if ya get em' up just right. Clip at your waist and struggle to manage the pump right up until the very end of the first pitch. Stand on huge feet next to the first set of anchors. This is the best rest on the climb. Be sure to get it all back, take twenty minutes to rest if you need to, now comes the rest of the climb.    And of course, those that wish to commit to All Strikes. No Balls. will inevitably have to commit the the adventurous beginning of pitch two. Enjoy five seven slabbery with a Needles-Style run out. Admit it, many of you have wanted to see someone blow the clip and fall after completing what has been called, ""The Second Inning Stretch"". It would more than likely be impossible. But it would be hella fun to watch.    Anyway, back to the ball game. After the run out adventure pitch, clip two more bolts in the black belly with longer draws and get ready to run like you are stealing home plate. A slightly different use of the exact same rail that one grabs to do the amazing crux moves of Around The Horn's second pitch puts you onto orange/blonde rock and has you motoring left, left, left. Reach far out left, catch a baseball sized hold with a sharp pyramid top and be sure to match it. It is probably better to be in a position where you make the clip at your right hip after completing a toe roll transition from a left foot heel hook. Keep traversing left on good holds and enjoy the first groin-destroying stem to a drop knee to a knee bar to a jug. Clip a long black chain. Deal with some strange moves that lead to a better pinch -to a deep three finger side pull- that will allow you to get to your feet and cheer.    Stand up on big, slanty slab feet and get ready to sprint across home plate. The final ten feet is very reminiscent of the second stopper pump crux on the first pitch. At this point, ya just gotta go for it, do a drop knee and stem just right and climb outta there on small, good holds to jugs at the open shunt anchor. Clipping a chain to the left of this second anchor allows the climber to continue the adventure through two steep roofs at a climbing grade of very upper five twelve plus to possibly thirteen aye-O.K. holds that end on the anchors of Ty Knob.    Climbs that are variations/extensions of existing classics usually don't win much praise from the fans who crave the nose-bleed seats. However, this climb is well worth your time and is just as classic as any climb in the area. For the grade its is a fun as heck/pumpy huck fest that will have you working so hard that you will not have any extra time to even think about downgrading it. While it might not have a ""stopper crux move"", like the infamous finger-lock on Pinch Hitter, this climb more than makes up for it with The Stadium-style exposure factor. Steepness, exhilarating climbing and dozens of hard on the go cruxy moves makes this route a full value experience rather than another lap to kill time. The only downside will be its popularity with emerging five twelve weekend warriors that will surely cause long lines to buy a ticket to get into the ball park.","{106398311: 4, 106661800: 4, 106688572: 4}"

The first pitch has you hurling yourself over powerful moves on overhung, blonde rock and is believed to go at 5.11c. Get ready to crimp and beg for the next jug! This fairly famous pitch has at least two stopper cruxes, both involving technique and the need to beat a quickly running pump clock. The last ten feet before the anchors seem to shut down most climber's dreams of running around all the bases before completely running out of steam.    After a pumpy/technical battle, gain the first anchors and bail if you are about to barf. Or, if you can handle more innings of ass-kickery, take a few dozen deep breaths and get that heart rate back to normal. The next 20 feet of climbing involves an easy slab that becomes a mental challenge because of the long run out known as ""The Second Inning Stretch.""    After groveling through the run out, clip a bolt in the steep, black belly, preferably using a shoulder length sling. Gain some more ground on a strange blocky outcropping and clip another bolt over your shoulder. AND NOW THE FUN BEGINS! Navigate and crawl up two small holds (a right hand sidepull and a left hand sloper crimp) to a good right hand side pull and gain some traction with a left knee bar. Using your left hand, reach out and grab a long black and orange rail using pure precision and allow your feet to cut. Allow your body to swing to the left in the correct gymnastic sequence and huck for a left hand juggy crimp, get a leg up to a knob and clip. There is no time to waste!

I have pulled the roof after pulling huge pockets below it that were located on the right hand side of the bolt line, however, this way is not as obvious as working moves to the left of the last bolt that involve left-hand, finger-crack side pulls that allow for some stemming in the dihedral before the climber is forced to use thin jugs to gain the anchors.

Erectile Dysfunction,107230498,Sport,107230486,5.10d,30,1,1.7,6.0,"18 million men in the United States currently suffer from erectile dysfunction, and this is no laughing manner.    The Erectile Dysfunction found within the loins of Spearfish Canyon is a short, powerful and technical climb found on a short, exceptionally blonde hunk of rock which is very easy to locate.    Erectile dysfunction or ED is the inability to achieve or sustain an erection suitable for sexual intercourse.    This particular climb has a very difficult start that requires some beta. Think out your moves before leaving the deck.    Problems with erections may stem from medications, chronic illnesses, poor blood flow to the penis, drinking too much alcohol, or being too tired. It can be a symptom of some serious health problems as well. See a doctor if you can't get an erection.    Immediately after the first bolt, you will be shaking and wondering, ""My foot...WHY CAN'T I GET IT UP...to that foothold?""      Lifestyle changes, medications, and other treatments are often used to treat ED.    At the second and third bolts, you will more than likely be very pumped...maybe even torched as you think to yourself, ""My hand...I CAN'T GET IT UP...to that handhold.""    Lifestyle changes, medications, and other treatments are often used to treat ED.    After a series of difficult, pumpy moves, you will find yourself only about twenty five feet off the ground, but will feel as if you've climbed two hundred feet. You will be looking at the anchors and thinking to yourself, ""OH MY GOD...my left hand...I CAN'T GET IT UP...to that nice jug!""    Some steps you can take to prevent ED include: stopping smoking, exercising regularly and maintaining a healthy weight.    And remember, even though impotence is nature's way of saying, ""No hard feelings."" this climb might leave you with a few hard feelings. Forget an onsight, this thing is basically the evil twin of a route called The Squall, which is located at The Thunderhead. Both of which are very HARD routes with grades that are not SOFT. Think you're gonna just gonna walk up a Spearfish Canyon 5.10+? Think again.    This climb is worth getting on over and over again until you finally redpoint. And remember, if Mike Cronin's worst nightmare actually does come true, and this remote climbing area is extremely crowded, and if you have to wait in line and can't get on can't get on something long and hard, then you might as well mount something short and stiff.

Hey You Guys!,117824593,Sport,114059665,5.11a,70,1,4.0,5.0,"Ladies and Gentlemen, here is this year's first contender for the 2019 Golden Bucket Award, and in addition that prestigious honor, it is also on the shortlist for BBQ's favorite climb of the year.  For those of you who loved ""Albert's Arete"" and ""Dead Residents"", here is your next challenge. THIS ROUTE HAS IT ALL! If you love climbing big holds, on steep limestone, make sure to come to Holy Hanna before the snow flies, and get on this one!  For those who love the climbing on The Prow at the Sunshine Wall, this route delivers a sick, off-width crack start with a runout to the first bolt. Use pockets to clip the second, and then be sure to head right and wrestle the arete-like formation by precisely using a left-hand fingercrack system and a series of crimps with your right. Right when it feels like you are about to fly off, undercling a big hold, stem like an Egyption, and use a hairy-scary, bouldery sequence to grab a jug in order to clip the third after a righteous struggle of pumpy porportions.  From there, the 100% pure fun begins! The whole route is nothing more than an exi-ten-tial exercise of grabbing onto big holds and catching good rests in between tricky sequences were footwork is imperative. Enjoy employing a bunch of strangely awesome stemming and compression moves, filled with thumb catches, crimps, and sidepulls to even better jugs. For those who love hucking to jugs in between thinker sequences -that seem improbable until you feel the orgasmic level of sticking succesfully to the rock- this route must not be missed.  Heyyyy Youuuuu Guysssss! Just like that TV show, ""The Electric Company"" and ""The Goonies"" movie, this route will soon be a highly syndicated classic because it follows the simple rules of excess success; climb on jugs, rest, think, climb again, handle some hard to deal with small holds, feel the rush of pumptastic suspense, grab some more jugs, rest and repeat about two dozen times before the final pumpy crux which guards the anchors so well. It is a classic example of classic canyon intermediately hard level climbing.  And while the climbing probably makes for a fairly pumpy warm-up for the accomplished 5.12- climber, this route will surely give the advancing intermediate five ten-er-bug a much needed challenge with a dopamine reward upon redpoint. The flow of sequences during the send is amazing! GET ON IT! GET ON! AND THEN GET ON IT AGAIN AND AGAIN! This route is pure Taster's Choice and 100% Original Canyon Buttery Flavor! So good!

Starts on pockets and makes its way up to a roof section that might make you think for a bit before you sail your way to the anchors. Paha Sapa is the perfect 5.9 in the stronghold of strong people climbs.     But wait! There's more! Those strong men and strong women, who actually believe in a warm-up burn before tearing into the harder routes, will benefit from climbing past the anchors of this climb and putting their rope through the next set of anchors to the right.     Voila! You now have a top-rope that falls directly over Peace Pipe. Have your belayer gently put you on the ground and start climbing again. Doing this will give you ANOTHER warm-up lap in the 5.10c range that will get your muscles and tendons where they need to be at before you take one of the many difficult climbs in the area.     On an interesting side note, Paha Sapa means ""Black Hills"" in Lakota. The original native people believed that the Paha Sapa were essentially the heart of everything in existance.

Toss your rope onto the lovely ground of a very cleaned out belay station and enjoy every minute after that. This route actually starts out easy and works its way up a killer, double crack system that has ample jugs, sidepulls, pockets and really, really good crack climbing for those who have some basic vocabulary in finger locks and tight hands. If you feel around enough, you will actually find deep, positive pockets within the cracks.     After about the 5th bolt it makes more sense to stay right of the bolt line for a few moves on really good rock that sports edges and pockets on terrain that starts off slightly overhung and then suddenly gets good and overhung.     Fight your way through a crux through the last two bolts and get good and past your last bolt on terrain where the pump will keep you guessing right up until you clip the chains.

Ya see, about 100 years ago, back when I was in college, my uninformed climbing partners in the Black Hills State University Climbing Club (myself included) used to call this climb, ""The route to the right of Land Speed Record.""    This situation was maddening(1). And the confusion might have been the result of the following fact (2). At the time, Bruce Junek's yellow guidebook had this climb listed as the very last climb on the big, black face right before (and just to the left of) Christian Baird's crack route, which to this day, still only sports a pair of anchors since Christian sent the crack (without bolts) using only trad gear. Whether or not that sick-looking crack has seen a second, third or even fourth ascent is questionable...but what was undeniable was that sometimes, after a day of rock climbing, I'd meet my friends at the bar and would ask them, ""So...did ya climb today?"" The answer was inevitably, ""Yes.""    Since South Dakotans typically need a lot of help to get a conversation going, I'd then ask, ""Where?""    To that they'd utter, ""Big Black Face.""    To this, my dismayed and aggitatedly curious mind would ask, ""What routes?""    ""Ah yah know...Ninja, Pakastani...Candy Apple Grey and the route to the right of Land Speed Record.""    I guess what confused everyone was the fact that (back in those days) there was ANOTHER route to the right of that route (that was just to the right of Land Speed record), which was to the left of that sick-looking crack that Christian Baird had established on trad gear(1). Junek's guidebook did not mention this route that was to the immediate left of Baird's crack route (2).    Oh, and by the way, Christain, if you are reading this...you have no idea how many times we talked about how sick of a send that must have been for you. Imagine a group of young, freezing climbers, standing in a circle (at the base of The Big Black Face) nodding their heads after one of them says, ""That must have been a sick send.""    Anyway! I have finally done the research! The climb to the right of Land Speed Record is officially named Husker Don't(3). Presumably, it is named after that band, Husker Du, that everyone listened to in college...but for some reason...could not remember the name of.    FOR THOSE WHO WANT ME TO SKIP THE NOSTOGLIA AND CUT TO THE CHASE: This is a long, slabby climb with an easy start, a killer, finger crack-like sequence in the middle section that leads to an undulating upper section with slopey holds that seems to never end. There are good rests on good ledges that have (over the years) allowed many a freezing college student to think long (and hard) about the next move to the next bolt that seems a million miles away.    Consensous: GREAT CLIMB! A classic for those (like me) who got to brag about our shivering send to our college friends at the bar. Some moves are committing and a bit unnerving.

Rude Awakening,107301442,Sport,106478619,5.11b,90,1,2.2,12.0,"There is just something about the 5.11b grade on Spearfish Canyon limestone that boggles the mind. 5.11b in Spearfish Canyon flat out means that you are ensured some great climbing. However, there will be at least one section, or even a few sections, of the climb that will be puzzling and requires some feat of strength and creative technique that will more than likely not be worked out the first time you try the route.     Climbs like Winger and Mary Jane are obvious feats of brute strenth, if you can keep pulling and can convince your spent arms and fingers to stick with it you can send. And then, there are routes like this one, where you are in for a rude awakening if you think you can just gorilla your way on up without any tactical plan or technical prowess.    This route has great slab climbing to a bulbous, roof like structure with a black side and a blonde side...and this is where the fun starts, or stops, depending on your perspective.    Should you go left or right at this first roof? Choose your own way to fall...this crux is a bitch of a Rubix Cube. My beta involves sticking my foot into the crack on the right and using the face moves at the same time. Through a slow, painful and meticulous process, use a toe jam technique to give yourself the leverage to work your fingers up some small pockets. When you're almost laying horizontal, use a not-so-obvious side pull, in the right manner, and you're golden to reach a big hold a long ways up the face...that is...if you can hold on.     Or use the sidepull to give you just enough leverage to gain a small pedestal below the roof for your left or right big toe. Stand tall and carefull to gain the massive jugs hidden somewhere behind the bulge of the business.    Either way, expect to take a few rides here.    After this roof the eleveness of this climb never really lets up and it's a big, committing endeavor with lots of situations that require a thinking cap and some fresh tendons. My thoughts are the crack on the right is fair game for the occasional foot and hand jam but don't get suckered into it.     Take absolute advantage of a huge, hidden jug on the far left side of the face.    Use the next series of face holds to their maximum potiential and wander from left to right and back again as you snake your way up this long, fantastic route that stays on your ass from the get go and never really lets up until you're lowering either through the anchors or a bail beaner.

I remember being a below average student in Pete's Black Hills State University chemistry class. I used to daydream about how cool it would be to be him. In addition to being a genius and climber to envy he was a super-nice guy. He would lecture us on the merits of a beer called Pete's Wicked Ale and even used it as an analogy for the principle of enthalpy...something that I just now began to understand. Pete deLannoy was so smart that he never had to pay attention, because attention paid him. When you took a chemistry test from Pete deLannoy all the right answers were, Pete deLannoy.

Soap can only kill about 99% of all germs, the rest can only be killed by Pete deLannoy.

Sosa hit his 600th career home run to become the fifth player in MLB history to reach the milestone. He is also the all-time home run leader among foreign-born MLB players. Furthermore, Sosa is one of only two National League Players to ever reach 160 RBI, a milestone he reached in 2001. All of those milestones were the result of hard work, determination, dedication to the game, and steroids.Sammy Sosa, the limestone gem located in Spearfish Canyon will make you wish you had taken a few steroids right out of the starting gate.

You'll get a decent rest before tackling the stinger redpoint crux up top with a 15 foot salsa section going to the anchors.

If you prefer trusting your feet to cutting them, be sure to be sure to check out this long, lovely gem - located on almost entirely black, slabby rock - which only gets steep when the holds get really, really good.  Start on a slab with pockets and crimps to a ledge. Enjoy what seems to be endless small holds -to better holds- over and over again. A backstep might be useful for the crux up top. Long, pleasurable, and not too terribly pumpy climbing makes this route a must do for those who seek out the style and the grade.","{106398311: 3, 107633259: 3}"

Find the freaky-deeky footholds and gain bowling ball pockets, perfect crimps and use the undercling mono/two finger thing just right to heave yourself up to a fantastic finish with a mono, a crimp, a lot of luck, and the perfect ending jugs.     OH MY GOD! I LOVE THIS THING! This is the perfect route for climbers who love technastical forearm killing fun that gets better and better the more times you lob yourself against it.

After taking down TKO (a multi-session project) I looked right and said, ""What the hell, got nothing to do anyway.""     Loved it!    This is another example of a really good route that goes for years and years without getting a second glance. Back in the day it had its own start, till someone thought the rock sucked, and now it shares the same start as TKO and shares its first five bolts before heading out right into some really fun territory. It stands to reason if the start of TKO is hard as hell, then going right after the fifth bolt should make this route easier since you skip that weird TKO crux that sends everyone flying off the wall? Right?    Hell No! Right hook is just as bit a 5.12 as anything else I've ever tried. So don't feel that you are pussing out by any means. Get on it and give it props. Or keep trying TKO till your taint gets chafed. Either way, I don't care, just be sure to give Right Hook at least one round before the final bell rings.
