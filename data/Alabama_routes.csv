When you reach the first roof you have two options, either start traversing left and up through the stacked roofs, or pull straight out the first roof and go up the face above. We went straight up and it was good times.    When you reach the ledge there's a nice spot to build a gear anchor at the back of an overhang and belay the second.    If you are smart and decide to rap down after p1, then there may be a yellow sling and quicklink on a tree 20 yards left. If it isn't there I'm sure you'll figure something out.    (P2, 5.fugly, 60ft.) If you're stupid like us and decide to do pitch 2, move over about 20 feet left from the belay. There's an obvious sort of bulging weakness through the rock above with a tree growing just to the left of it. Pull through the overhang on big jugs and then start weaseling your way up through dirt and brush and trees both living and deceased. Eventually you'll reach another 20 foot section of cliff. Clamber up this to reach the top and belay from the trees. You'll basically be in someone's backyard at this point, so keep a low profile and don't be a dick.    The way we got down was to head climber's right along the faint clifftop trail for about 30 yards or so. There will be an opportunity to scramble down and back climber's left to a lower tree ledge about 15 feet or so down from the clifftop trail. On that ledge there was a big tree that has a nice horizontal section of trunk about 10 feet up. We threw our rope over that and rapped down. Once you get through the vegetation on the ledge, the rest of the way is smooth sailing.    With a single 60 meter rope you may BARELY reach the ground. If not, there's a good ledge about 6 feet off the ground where you could stop and pull your rope and then clamber down. A 70 meter rope will make it with room to spare.

A deep jug is up and to the right about a two and a half or three feet above the matched hold you're on. This move is the crux. Stick the hold, match, and work your feet up. Sit your feet, into the dish that you matched on before the crux. Lean in, grab the pinches on either side and scramble up to the top.    The jug that you have to stick for the crux is AWESOME!

NOTE:  Oyster is the subject of some confusion with neighboring routes on the south side of Holiday block.  In the Dixie Cragger's Atlas, the listing for Gravy Train actually describes Oyster, while the listing for Oyster should be labeled as Rabies (5.11a).  Some consider Oyster a retrobolt of the trad line Gravy Train, but the two climbs, while close in proximity, are separate routes with distinctly different climbing character.","{105845475: 4, 105904878: 4, 107856488: 4, 107886864: 4, 106368697: 4, 105886712: 4, 106907332: 4, 107945351: 4, 107495403: 4, 106578194: 4, 107508542: 4, 109409153: 4, 109712255: 4, 108027731: 4, 106329264: 4, 108088813: 4, 112198148: 4, 106997170: 4, 110301942: 4, 111221677: 4, 200042660: 4, 108732554: 4, 200132992: 4, 200024544: 4, 7093805: 4, 200033758: 4, 112172298: 4, 107852661: 4, 200084381: 4, 200435053: 4, 200440335: 4, 200383645: 4, 200048754: 4, 200446273: 4, 200463523: 4, 200636136: 4, 200160322: 4, 200605581: 4, 200418933: 4, 200386903: 4, 107224111: 4, 112555409: 4, 200839008: 4, 200567895: 4, 200759694: 4, 107219020: 3, 107643093: 3, 107342926: 3, 107528242: 3, 106098470: 3, 106120631: 3, 105905885: 3, 107555465: 3, 106196657: 3, 107861772: 3, 108026607: 3, 106714222: 3, 106757022: 3, 106821960: 3, 106856483: 3, 107769506: 3, 106470594: 3, 106607660: 3, 106967373: 3, 106952502: 3, 107071728: 3, 107365513: 3, 106449553: 3, 107384044: 3, 107453284: 3, 107775680: 3, 107328886: 3, 106689180: 3, 107845994: 3, 106901183: 3, 107870032: 3, 108430574: 3, 108593951: 3, 108692574: 3, 108939400: 3, 106610639: 3, 108414444: 3, 108320578: 3, 110422165: 3, 110497345: 3, 109046882: 3, 109869081: 3, 110054189: 3, 110985261: 3, 109188030: 3, 110528367: 3, 111751314: 3, 107636134: 3, 111747281: 3, 109629488: 3, 111835232: 3, 111150841: 3, 111886223: 3, 110875347: 3, 112169215: 3, 109887552: 3, 112171525: 3, 111442903: 3, 112352576: 3, 111565043: 3, 111400944: 3, 111795422: 3, 107534649: 3, 109634018: 3, 109841901: 3, 112298125: 3, 107729812: 3, 112146797: 3, 111820839: 3, 110282876: 3, 200040132: 3, 108041064: 3, 200087622: 3, 110224726: 3, 200159894: 3, 200095092: 3, 200185175: 3, 200062258: 3, 200185739: 3, 200122090: 3, 112300161: 3, 200061933: 3, 200097560: 3, 200244553: 3, 200248595: 3, 200066569: 3, 107521255: 3, 109537623: 3, 200214738: 3, 111347316: 3, 112568996: 3, 200360284: 3, 200064504: 3, 111895157: 3, 200383373: 3, 200238699: 3, 200450463: 3, 111639255: 3, 200460623: 3, 200407762: 3, 111380201: 3, 106242342: 3, 200056640: 3, 200472602: 3, 200447987: 3, 112037922: 3, 200413312: 3, 200517560: 3, 111566883: 3, 200622148: 3, 200359092: 3, 112161285: 3, 200396960: 3, 200443436: 3, 200622871: 3, 200375313: 3, 109679606: 3, 111885672: 3, 200404978: 3, 107738545: 2, 107751083: 2, 106320266: 2, 105990845: 2, 105972853: 2, 106527071: 2, 105907433: 2, 106915043: 2, 106933264: 2, 105860008: 2, 108008667: 2, 107645832: 2, 108720484: 2, 109761418: 2, 109383300: 2, 107136345: 2, 112443137: 2, 112066758: 2, 200082121: 2, 106761693: 2, 200071359: 2, 110512167: 2, 200412448: 2, 109933971: 2, 107795619: 2, 105849600: 1, 110585748: 1, 109583101: 0}"

Mystery Route on Hot Wing Buttress,111108531,Trad,110819929,5.9+,85,1,3.0,2.0,"This route starts at the lower right margin of the Hot Wing Buttress on erosional edges and horizontals. Four or five bolts lead off of the ground, up and around the arete on a rampish-cracky section, then through a awkward roof/slot.     Once the slot is pulled, a distinct second section requires a high-step off of the ledge and then a couple body lengths of slab to jugs. Beware the ledge-fall here.    Then, once on the second major ledge, one is faced with a nice crack to the right or a blank bolted face to the left. The lone bolt can also be used as a clean top-out from the crack; a directional and last piece before the ring anchors to the left.     If one continues up the crack to the trough, anchors are not nearby.     I discovered this route in October 2015. It is quite good and I don't know who put it up. It is fairly new.

Gym rats and boulderers will love this one.  Sequence through the first couple bolts is important to minimize the number of moves and to be clipping off the right holds.     Steepish climbing on jugs and edges lead to the second bolt where a wild balancy sequence starts involving a sloping sidepull and a huge right hand move to a full-hand flat edge. Easier climbing on medium to small edges gets you to the second crux just below the juggy horizontals a body length below the top. Either use a crimp on the right  to gain the jugs, or use a bad shallow pinch on the left and make a big dyno right/up for the jug rail. Either way, latch the jugs, clip the last bolt and romp up 5-easy for a bodylength to the top.     Although this was originally rated 12b, a foothold broke sometime after I last climbed it (mid/late 90s), yielding a better foot, and consensus is that it's now quite a bit easier, with the grade settling around 11d.
