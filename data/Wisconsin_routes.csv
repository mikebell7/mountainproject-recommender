I'm talking about a ""real"" 5.12--not some obscure short climb at Horse Rampart or some corner over at Sandstone. I'm talking about hard moves, tricky pro and mandatory runouts in groundfall territory. I'm talking about a 5.12 that is a hair's breadth away from the mythical routes like Bagatelle whose leads only live in the memory of a few crazed souls. Yeah, you guessed it, I'm talking about going All the Way.  As with all 5.12 leads at DL, the stories about All the Way abound. Of course there was Deutchler's first ascent, which I didn't witness (I was two years old), but which I imagine taking place with a bunch of DLFAers sitting around, saying ""Whoa man, that was groovy."" Tommy's ascent did pave the way for other groundbreaking ascents of the era, Bagatelle included. Then there's the time that Zschiesche headed up the climb with no gear, and asked bystanders to throw him up the needed pieces. This technique never seemed to catch on, as the hassle I'm sure outweighed any weight savings. And finally, there was the time when I punted off the start crux moves, crashed into the arms of my spotters and may have broken, or seriously sprained, the finger of one willing spotter.  To start the climb, locate the funky corner to the right of Congratulations. Climbing from the ground to the obvious hourglass hold presents the crux of the route. I thought it felt about V6, but I used spotters and crashpads, so feel free to judge me as not a true trad climber. There is no real pro until you stick the hourglass hold. Once you stick the hold, however, you must steel yourself for some heady climbing to reach the belay ledge of The Pedestal. This section feels 5.11ish, and you pass a welcome horizontal that offers a good rest and some nice pro. Above the horizontal, a small stopper protects the final hard move, which is just tenuous enough to keep your attention as you reach The Pedestal ledge.  I'm not sure how the original route finished, but I like to think that Deutchler forged straight up the wall above The Pedestal ledge. On my lead, I tried to stay true to the line and I headed up steep rock above the ledge up to the long-forgotten mini-route called The Trick. This 5.8 wall is a harder ending to Lower Diagonal, and in my eyes, is the natural ending to All the Way.

He didn't fall, but lowered off once after pounding in the first pin. He then went back up, placed the second one and sent. None of us could follow, despite many attempts. It goes straight up the thin crack to the bucket on Ironmonger's. Within reach, but not allowed, are the huge right arete side- pull and 2 fairly good edges within 6 inches of the arete.

Rather than traversing right at the alcove (a la Brinton's Crack), Brinton's Direct forges a bold path straight up the face. These tenuous and airy moves lead directly (hence the name) to the top of the buttress.     On lead, the climb protects fairly well, but it's just run-out enough to give it that unique Devil's Lake feel.

Michael's Project,105731009,Trad,105730107,5.7+,70,1,2.4,103.0,"Michael's Project is a stunning line that lies just around the prow of 09: Many Pines Buttress from its slightly more classic neighbor Peter's Project. Michael's, like Peter's, has a low crux that leads to easier, aesthetic climbing above. Unlike Peter's, a route that is adored by all, Michael's inspires strong opinions in both directions. Simply put, climbers either love Michael's or they hate it.  From the base, Michael's appears to be an appealing, straightforward crack system, that forms the line of weakness up an impressive wall. But then, from the base, it is easy to look past the start. Reviewing the comments below (or even the entire forum, Michael's Project:  Timeless classic or horrific sandbag?, on the subject) will give the aspirant climber quite an education in the variety of opinions surrounding the quality of climbing to be found at the beginning of Michael's. Almost everyone who has climbed Michael's, will agree that the start is awkward, wide, polished and often slimy. The disagreement about Michael's concerns whether the climbing beyond the start properly compensates the climber for what he or she endured to get there.  Having groveled (and there really is no other word for it, except maybe ""thrutched"") up the difficult, off-width, inside-corner start, the climber can reach back-and-to-the-right, latch a jug just around the corner on the face left of Callipigeanous Crack (continuing straight up the inside corner would place the climber on Kamikaze - a dubious proposition indeed). After establishing on the right-hand face, the climber is richly-rewarded with the route he or she had expected in the beginning. Good holds on the face lead the climber up to where it is possible (and indeed, desirable) to head back into the corner and continue to the top on solid jams. The route finishes in a narrow hanging gully.  In the end, an ascent of Michael's Project (especially on the sharp end) is a rite of passage for all DL climbers. So, grab a rope, a rack, a willing partner and get out there to experience Michael's for yourself. Only then can you add your voice to the cacophony of firmly-held opinions. Love it or hate it, you'll never forget it.","{13230: 4, 13389: 4, 105810393: 4, 105818656: 4, 10672: 4, 105863255: 4, 106747051: 4, 13965: 4, 106216128: 4, 107965009: 4, 108779252: 4, 200371276: 4, 112002095: 4, 200117603: 4, 110959609: 4, 107909435: 4, 200970853: 4, 105816622: 3, 106912116: 3, 107585679: 3, 107130713: 3, 106172063: 3, 106226365: 3, 105849172: 3, 106158835: 3, 105917266: 3, 106893421: 3, 107255513: 3, 107154237: 3, 108290367: 3, 107813084: 3, 108441459: 3, 110745313: 3, 108392797: 3, 107277385: 3, 108999258: 3, 109997538: 3, 108533389: 3, 112078423: 3, 200099975: 3, 110566672: 3, 200053864: 3, 200148788: 3, 200480860: 3, 111460290: 3, 200548959: 3, 111967377: 3, 200217216: 3, 200160322: 3, 112430708: 3, 200452097: 3, 200841180: 3, 111704941: 3, 200422326: 3, 10557: 2, 105828100: 2, 106195833: 2, 106055829: 2, 10232: 2, 105934987: 2, 106020029: 2, 105976899: 2, 11453: 2, 106696449: 2, 107281563: 2, 107270368: 2, 107525023: 2, 107656555: 2, 105886022: 2, 109498955: 2, 107469550: 2, 107883720: 2, 108462960: 2, 109607267: 2, 106227337: 2, 108280591: 2, 111924430: 2, 110271502: 2, 106662993: 2, 108279275: 2, 108895420: 2, 200525410: 2, 200213045: 2, 12736: 1, 106467374: 1, 107641541: 1, 105969464: 1, 106692255: 1, 107104674: 1, 107147231: 1, 108674850: 1, 109567499: 1, 108140362: 1, 11035: 0, 11954: 0, 13396: 0, 105886426: 0, 10610: 0, 106460214: 0, 106554608: 0, 11725: 0, 108225929: 0, 110699720: 0}"

However, this toil will be rewarded with excellent climbing on the beautiful, low-angle face above. Even those climbers with more experience should not underestimate the funky body-English required to negotiate the polished holds and finger-locks in the first twenty feet - more than one 5.10 climber has been humbled by the sequential nature climbing here.     After the start, the angle, and difficulty, drop considerably. Here, climbers can choose to follow the right-angling crack to a pine tree, finishing on chunky, unaesthetic climbing above the tree. Preferably, and to get full-value from the route, many will head left, working into another crack system where they will enjoy excellent climbing in a beautiful position. All should pause at one of the many comfortable rests to take full-advantage, soak in the amazing view of the valley below, lean back, take a deep breath, look up at the sky and laugh at the world for a few seconds. It is here where, with the sunshine on their faces, many climbers have found the answer to the eternal question ""Why?""     For those hoping to maximize their experience on Peter's, the route offers one more optional (although some purists and the 1970 Climber's and Hiker's Guide call it mandatory) challenge. Having taken the left crack system, climbers will find themselves deposited on a comfortable ledge, where they will encounter another ledge to their left, separated from the main wall by a #3.0 C4 size crack (a long sling is useful here). From this ledge, a two or three move sequence provides a final, but tenuous, upper-crux. The further left the climber stays the more difficult this sequence is.     After surmounting the ""headwall"" a move or two on blocky terrain deposits the climber at the base of a giant boulder. A few cams in the #0.75-#2.0 C4 size range will allow for quick and efficient anchor construction.","{10507: 4, 10439: 4, 107130713: 4, 105816622: 4, 105886426: 4, 10672: 4, 106912116: 4, 106202599: 4, 107552577: 4, 105980259: 4, 13396: 4, 107205160: 4, 106135193: 4, 105871367: 4, 106323775: 4, 107178013: 4, 105934987: 4, 13965: 4, 105798456: 4, 105849172: 4, 13083: 4, 106020029: 4, 106056761: 4, 106114227: 4, 106460214: 4, 106377017: 4, 106554608: 4, 106662993: 4, 14152: 4, 106893421: 4, 106491411: 4, 106275308: 4, 106947927: 4, 10610: 4, 106747051: 4, 106889287: 4, 106586128: 4, 11725: 4, 106195833: 4, 105828100: 4, 107555793: 4, 108084480: 4, 107525023: 4, 107656555: 4, 108298749: 4, 107789169: 4, 107469550: 4, 108368263: 4, 107362202: 4, 108225929: 4, 108588676: 4, 106645071: 4, 108943556: 4, 109498955: 4, 109920932: 4, 107883720: 4, 108977855: 4, 108779252: 4, 108241308: 4, 108592672: 4, 109997538: 4, 110959609: 4, 111738681: 4, 107469360: 4, 109017144: 4, 107154237: 4, 112002095: 4, 106227337: 4, 111816000: 4, 108140362: 4, 109212991: 4, 111231935: 4, 107258759: 4, 200053864: 4, 107761407: 4, 200145854: 4, 110865489: 4, 200099975: 4, 200149886: 4, 110946269: 4, 107996336: 4, 200269522: 4, 106908697: 4, 200265626: 4, 200045829: 4, 107165466: 4, 108940304: 4, 109529479: 4, 200480860: 4, 200213045: 4, 200064832: 4, 200117603: 4, 200164243: 4, 111460290: 4, 111460283: 4, 106014521: 4, 200148788: 4, 200160322: 4, 200477875: 4, 200217216: 4, 200175522: 4, 200452097: 4, 200355362: 4, 200912795: 4, 111704941: 4, 109197897: 4, 200422326: 4, 108978844: 4, 107942610: 4, 107449136: 3, 107585679: 3, 105822904: 3, 105923322: 3, 107725014: 3, 106467374: 3, 105881356: 3, 106483800: 3, 107641541: 3, 107785600: 3, 105818656: 3, 10232: 3, 107290646: 3, 105969464: 3, 106226365: 3, 106075229: 3, 105952525: 3, 106440241: 3, 105917266: 3, 11156: 3, 106236472: 3, 106696449: 3, 11958: 3, 11453: 3, 106736172: 3, 106892642: 3, 107156738: 3, 107255513: 3, 106172063: 3, 107107751: 3, 107162477: 3, 106974860: 3, 106514856: 3, 108287468: 3, 105886022: 3, 107827336: 3, 107742336: 3, 108140001: 3, 109285131: 3, 108674850: 3, 109485255: 3, 108279275: 3, 109352948: 3, 110483261: 3, 110486519: 3, 107518458: 3, 110745313: 3, 110348962: 3, 105966977: 3, 108392797: 3, 111216347: 3, 107837713: 3, 110756823: 3, 111250005: 3, 109607267: 3, 106587534: 3, 108793314: 3, 111752519: 3, 105851541: 3, 108584079: 3, 110705388: 3, 107633218: 3, 111924430: 3, 112078423: 3, 112077661: 3, 111696814: 3, 200070559: 3, 200241833: 3, 200202741: 3, 111901865: 3, 112307962: 3, 111402216: 3, 110811370: 3, 200118237: 3, 200508383: 3, 200548959: 3, 111967377: 3, 200183745: 3, 200525410: 3, 112430708: 3, 200555801: 3, 107909435: 3, 107755397: 3, 200841180: 3, 107529159: 3, 200419289: 3, 200227081: 3, 200721137: 3, 106692255: 2, 105798149: 2, 106096614: 2, 105936209: 2, 107104674: 2, 107270368: 2, 107280283: 2, 107147231: 2, 109567499: 2, 110028906: 2, 110271502: 2, 200383995: 2, 108895420: 2, 200448485: 2, 200302179: 1}"

The route ascends this this crack and face holds (particularly those face holds to the right near or on Cliff's Coitus) to a ledge with a pine tree about 20-25 feet off the deck. Passing the tree on the right, it ascends some blocky climbing to another ledge. At this ledge it is possible to make a traverse up-and-to-the-right into a v-slot. After arriving in the v-slot it is possible to finish up-and-right to the ledge above Orgasm (where the easier anchor setup is), or go direct up overhanging blocky holds (depositing the climber on a ledge with few choices for anchoring).   Foreplay can be protected extremely well, and would make an excellent first-lead for a competent toproper ready to take the next step. This is all-the-more true given that it has several opportunities (the ledges) to rest and fully recover (or even possibly escape to easier terrain) as well as the opportunity to sling what seems to be a solid tree for protection at the first ledge.

Rest assured: the Funnel is only about twenty feet long. Next, continue up easy, broken ledges, reminiscent of an alpine climb. This leads you to the base of the best part of the climb, an overhanging corner system.    Climb the corner, made easy by stemming and huge buckets (hence the name), past a relic piton if it is still there, and flop onto a ledge with a perfect view of the Lake.

The place they described was a mirror image of this world and a utopia of sorts; a place of peace and abundance.  At Devils Lake however, Happy Hunting Grounds is a long, stand out classic for the grade which demands a cool head and control of your footwork. Its also a showcase route for the Hawks Nest and starts out on the right side of the wall. This technical face route follows an incipient seam system up a gorgeous swath of stone passing marginal small wire placements and 5.9 climbing. A thoughtful and positive 5.11- crux with a few good pieces of gear awaits at 2/3 height and is followed by more airy climbing on good holds with spacey pro. Aim for the small notched roof before the angle break, and then romp to the top.  This is a fairly serious lead for the grade, and you'll want to make sure you are up for it. The 1979 guide offers this captivating advice if you question your skills: ""Leaders who fall on this climb may go to the happy hunting grounds"".

You have to lead some routes that, let's be honest, you wouldn't normally think of leading. When was the last time you led The Monster? Or Mongo Fury (Burt, you don't count!)? Or Pine Box? And maybe consider adding Thoroughfare, because, I don't know about you, but I'd rather lead Thoroughfare than, say, Big Deal.     Here's the order I chose for Astroboy:    1. Mongo Fury   2.

Use some webbing to anchor yourself around the spire at the top. Topside belay your second and have him clean the pitch.  Then dump a #7 cam in one of the big cracks by the belay stance.  There are some smaller cracks closer to the edge that should take a #4 cam. Use the webbing around the spire for your bomber anchor and equalize the two cams for a backup.  I'm sure there are plenty of other ways to set up this top rope, but this worked well for me.  Throw your rope over the edge that faces the lake, rap off, and you're all set to climb.     Queen's Face is a wake up call at 5.8 after Queen's Throune at 5.4...but that's a good thing.  Climb the two parallel flared cracks that go almost all the way to the top.  Expect very thin, balancy foot holds.  The crux is pretty close to the ground, around the fourth or fifth move.  There is a real positive rest hold about half way up.  After that, shoot for the top.      You could probably lead this, but like I said, the crux is awful close to the ground and it's really easy to set up a top rope.  It's up to you.  Overall, a real nice route. It's worth doing a couple of laps on it.","{107389498: 4, 108779252: 4, 107641541: 4, 106926875: 4, 112286747: 4, 200101945: 4, 105917266: 4, 109197897: 4, 200217216: 4, 200483997: 4, 200912795: 4, 107552577: 4, 105980259: 4, 200841180: 4, 106692255: 4, 200279523: 4, 110923255: 3, 111372835: 3, 110872730: 3, 112430708: 3, 106947927: 3, 111050645: 3, 108592672: 3, 108148612: 3, 108943556: 3, 108674850: 3, 111754190: 3, 107277385: 3, 109040649: 3, 200525410: 3, 112002095: 3, 111216347: 3, 200533304: 3, 200265626: 3, 200225928: 3, 108793314: 3, 200609301: 3, 112025009: 3, 112284974: 3, 109141699: 3, 111597845: 3, 108392797: 3, 106747051: 3, 106554608: 3, 106020029: 3, 106893421: 3, 107449136: 3, 106460214: 3, 106344404: 3, 106226365: 3, 107178013: 3, 107785600: 3, 107130713: 3, 107280283: 3, 11725: 3, 106241215: 3, 13965: 3, 105860854: 3, 11958: 3, 106491411: 3, 106662993: 3, 107381314: 3, 107362202: 3, 106467374: 3, 107270152: 3, 105818656: 3, 107469550: 3, 106804138: 3, 107254714: 3, 106268486: 3, 107173932: 3, 106890432: 3, 109165205: 2, 111453313: 2, 105969464: 2, 14282: 2, 108182718: 2, 11156: 2, 10703: 2, 111752519: 2, 108279275: 2, 108386357: 2, 106158835: 2, 105923019: 2, 109529479: 2, 105892825: 2, 107656555: 1}"

It is a very vertical crack and ends to the right of the tall rock spike atop the climb.","{10545: 4, 106586128: 4, 107130713: 4, 107552577: 4, 106692255: 4, 105816775: 4, 13396: 4, 105881356: 4, 107113008: 4, 13965: 4, 105980259: 4, 11725: 4, 106055829: 4, 105816622: 4, 106225792: 4, 106344404: 4, 105934987: 4, 106662993: 4, 14152: 4, 106247789: 4, 107212540: 4, 107173932: 4, 106268486: 4, 107363666: 4, 106646737: 4, 108110447: 4, 108130300: 4, 107785600: 4, 108159746: 4, 108105844: 4, 108386357: 4, 10610: 4, 108948044: 4, 109086086: 4, 109325110: 4, 109485255: 4, 108447207: 4, 107827336: 4, 109305902: 4, 109935652: 4, 108779252: 4, 110087699: 4, 110642863: 4, 108592672: 4, 107309020: 4, 109212991: 4, 107104674: 4, 109533021: 4, 109944544: 4, 110946269: 4, 107154237: 4, 108222002: 4, 107277385: 4, 108091000: 4, 107752406: 4, 111643640: 4, 110350594: 4, 200053864: 4, 200045757: 4, 111901865: 4, 112025009: 4, 112078423: 4, 111816000: 4, 111905124: 4, 112002095: 4, 200059206: 4, 107727480: 4, 200225928: 4, 200174451: 4, 111711467: 4, 200167316: 4, 200244837: 4, 200245131: 4, 111859893: 4, 200078535: 4, 200176968: 4, 200213045: 4, 109101477: 4, 200117956: 4, 106327610: 4, 109197897: 4, 200446772: 4, 200258398: 4, 109272971: 4, 109468689: 4, 112430708: 4, 112531999: 4, 200441549: 4, 200217216: 4, 200355362: 4, 200279523: 4, 200053241: 4, 200383995: 4, 200912795: 4, 200202771: 4, 110712867: 4, 106947927: 4, 200066638: 4, 106507761: 3, 106747051: 3, 107449136: 3, 107592508: 3, 106545281: 3, 105930344: 3, 107197686: 3, 107742336: 3, 105917266: 3, 105892825: 3, 106564832: 3, 107708017: 3, 107178013: 3, 106158835: 3, 106236472: 3, 106075229: 3, 106020029: 3, 106554608: 3, 11156: 3, 106893421: 3, 106696449: 3, 107362202: 3, 106804138: 3, 107270152: 3, 105923019: 3, 106467374: 3, 107615154: 3, 108084480: 3, 107469550: 3, 105805486: 3, 107525023: 3, 108287468: 3, 107641541: 3, 106713152: 3, 108943556: 3, 106645071: 3, 108674850: 3, 109165205: 3, 108378808: 3, 109567499: 3, 110217013: 3, 108279275: 3, 110562400: 3, 110566672: 3, 111050645: 3, 110896562: 3, 110872730: 3, 110756823: 3, 111372835: 3, 108392797: 3, 110923255: 3, 111848152: 3, 110648296: 3, 111745195: 3, 107795894: 3, 108624519: 3, 111597845: 3, 111216347: 3, 111771784: 3, 108793314: 3, 112284974: 3, 108290379: 3, 112366542: 3, 112472624: 3, 106646308: 3, 110164501: 3, 111791264: 3, 111453313: 3, 112286747: 3, 105818656: 3, 111402216: 3, 109285215: 3, 200265626: 3, 112077661: 3, 200121746: 3, 200093542: 3, 200070559: 3, 109529479: 3, 200331472: 3, 200059204: 3, 14282: 3, 107040811: 3, 107517124: 3, 200302179: 3, 200517203: 3, 200525410: 3, 200483997: 3, 108940304: 3, 200222568: 3, 200665954: 3, 200841180: 3, 107529159: 3, 200533304: 3, 200766126: 3, 13629: 2, 106226365: 2, 11453: 2, 108318462: 2, 110483261: 2, 107767899: 2, 110486519: 2, 111754190: 2, 109765915: 2, 107428854: 2, 200077420: 2, 111752519: 2, 110271502: 2, 105969464: 1, 107656555: 1}"

Sure the pitches are short, but its all we've got.     To approach, walk north past the cabins on Tumbled Rocks Trail until you can see a tower about 50 yards above the trail. This is the first pitch (5.3).  Descend the tower, and continue on long, mostly unbroken ridge to the base of Wiessner Wall.  Continue up Wiessner in two pitches and complete the longest route in Wisconsin.    Pitch two (5.6), an ugly wide inside corner, protects well with big cams. The third pitch, a left slanting finger crack is the crux (5.8) and difficult to protect.  It is short, though, and the 5.6 face to the right might afford the leader some respite.

Bolton Traverse,107743123,Boulder,105730041,V1,15,1,3.0,1.0,"This is located in and and near the enclosed walkway connecting the Student Union with Bolton Hall. The indoor section runs the length of the only solid wall in an otherwise glass walkway, while the outdoor section runs to the west along Bolton Hall's south wall. The outdoor plaza (under construction) is accessible via double-doors from the walkway.    This problem can be approached and completed in dozens of ways. The climber is limited only by his or her imagination. This is really more of a whole buildering location than a single route, but given the sporadic patterning on the wall, well-defined problems or routes are hard to codify or repeat. This traverse, in my eyes, is best utilized by climbing laterally - without using the ledge at the top - to build endurance. Individual problems or routes could be mapped out by climbers upon arrival .     Indoors or outdoors, the climber may choose to sit-start at literally any point and climb vertically or traverse laterally to the heart's content. The edges are ~3/4 to ~1 inch deep, with a small lip to the climber's advantage in many spots. There's a deeper ledge running the length of the wall at the very top.    Inside, the otherwise unbroken decorative wall is split by a vertical gap roughly 2 or 3 inches wide running the height of the wall. This can easily be lay-backed & flagged for a modest crack-climb. The gap is maybe 6 - 10 ft from the Bolton Hall doors and barely visible in the ""detail"" indoor photo. It runs basically parallel to the line in the floor all the way at the end.    As of the summer of 2012, the small plaza between the Union and Bolton hall is under construction, and a large swath of the outdoor wall is enclosed behind construction fencing. Technically, the entire section is still accessible.     Lastly, many of the edges in the indoor section - because they're not exposed to the elements - are quite dusty, adding an additional challenge when traversing indoors.",{107604663: 3}

Because of its odd position on a sloping arete, even toprope ascents have been considered somewhat sketchy. Recently, with the blessing of the first-ascensionist, five bolts and anchors have appeared making this an enjoyable sport route in a classic position.    The upper anchors were placed to facilitate rappelling off the Hell Wall (aka Quarry Wall) (west/climber's left) side of the arete, rather than rappelling or lowering directly down the crest of the arete (a disconcerting proposition at best). Even topropers might be well-advised to make use of the protection bolts as directionals given the sharp and sloping nature of the arete.","{111272262: 4, 108999258: 4, 111231935: 4, 107622637: 4, 200259400: 4, 200265208: 4, 112159020: 4, 200246192: 4, 111866609: 4, 110535934: 4, 200387826: 4, 105818656: 4, 200456169: 4, 200331472: 4, 200426090: 4, 200343877: 4, 111704941: 4, 200680253: 4, 200403889: 4, 200525410: 4, 111982082: 4, 112194018: 4, 200912795: 4, 200867819: 4, 200952402: 4, 200609301: 4, 13965: 4, 105816622: 3, 108592672: 3, 108779252: 3, 109568851: 3, 200039658: 3, 110865489: 3, 107318493: 3, 200127173: 3, 112851513: 3, 112286747: 3, 200149886: 3, 111013333: 3, 111686720: 3, 200107541: 3, 200034761: 3, 112147018: 3, 200210413: 3, 200327186: 3, 107772111: 3, 105934987: 3, 108338507: 3, 200268505: 3, 200110565: 3, 109468689: 3, 110857115: 3, 200398111: 3, 7017599: 3, 200279734: 3, 200075807: 3, 200462988: 3, 200436094: 3, 200302179: 3, 200721137: 3, 200227081: 3, 111771784: 3, 200454163: 3, 200451296: 3, 200281750: 3, 107521255: 3, 200619038: 3, 112169632: 3, 112430708: 3, 200273764: 3, 200293514: 3, 107741581: 3, 200593408: 3, 200065694: 3, 200116753: 3, 200101945: 3, 200858155: 3, 200333472: 3, 112337532: 3, 111888128: 3, 113306774: 3, 107827336: 2, 10610: 2, 112515093: 2, 113273369: 2, 108222837: 2, 111453313: 2, 200041573: 2, 200213045: 2, 110878214: 2, 200067746: 2, 200069761: 2, 109512613: 2, 112078423: 2, 200065718: 2, 200077824: 2, 200456589: 2, 200293497: 2, 200326200: 2, 108940304: 2, 200383995: 1}"

Since the route has been aggressively labeled a ""squeeze job"" and it lacks discernable natural placements at the crux, it was long forgotten and was subsequently covered in bird sh*t, lichen, and broken rock.Recently rediscovered and bolted, it took some community involvement to figure out the route's roots. Many holds were broken in the process of cleaning the route - the instability of the original rock further confirms that Rich was more of a man than all of us internet types put together. The crux sequences now rely on smaller, albeit trustworthy holds. Expect a large fall at the crux, and (if you're sane and choose to clip the bolts) hang a long draw from the fourth bolt.

A hard start gives way to easier climbing, angling leftward to the corner (it is harder than 5.10a to bypass the corner and continue straight up). The bolts eventually bring the climber back out on the narrowing face. Here the climbing is very special: the holds become patina-like, and the lichen stands out in technicolor splashes.    Upon completing the route, the climber is treated to one of the best summits in Wisconsin (behind Cleo's Needle, of course). From the small point of the tower, the climber can look out to the Petenwell Lake area or gaze with wonderment at the harder routes on Y-Crack wall.

The climb follows discontinuous cracks up the steep face.     The bottom of the face is heavily featured and offers 5.10ish climbing up to the second bolt. The features eventually run out and force the climber into exceedingly thin and dynamic moves to link the widely spaced cracks. Once past the crux, some welcome pockets await; however, they offer little reprieve. A classic top out deposits the climber on a ledge with anchors.     All in all: 50 feet of climbing, increasingly strenuous moves with no rests on perfect, beautiful sandstone. I call it the best hard route in Wisconsin.    Note: Dave Groth (FA) intended for the last bolt to be clipped and for the climbing to remain on the face the whole way. Bailing left before the last bolt and climbing easier rock to the top is considerably easier and is NOT the original route.","{109678890: 4, 112250937: 4, 108270739: 4, 106810689: 4, 112851513: 4, 106768918: 4, 108779252: 4, 110166994: 4, 110920929: 4, 14544: 4, 108037296: 4, 107526478: 4, 109355262: 4, 108999258: 4, 106022334: 4, 200116753: 4, 110164501: 4, 107521255: 4, 200227081: 4, 111127829: 4, 112287615: 4, 111752959: 4, 110271502: 4, 112147018: 4, 200131859: 4, 108962560: 4, 106483800: 4, 107814422: 4, 107555793: 4, 106055829: 4, 106005596: 4, 105996719: 4, 105952525: 4, 105934987: 4, 105917266: 4, 14120: 4, 14216: 4, 106047496: 4, 105926739: 4, 105849172: 4, 105873923: 4, 106974860: 4, 106747051: 4, 105969464: 4, 105871367: 4, 106864639: 4, 107036187: 4, 106733910: 4, 105828100: 4, 106335773: 4, 106230422: 4, 10610: 4, 110914708: 3}"

The crux is getting the two roof pockets. I marked the holds with chalk, so hopefully it's easier to find where I'm talking about ​ HOW I DID IT:         I started with my left hand pinching on the protruding rock by having my hand facing left on it and getting my thumb on the very small notch in the middle of the right side of it for a little leverage, the other hand was on the small side crimp, my left foot was on the small ledge directly under the left starting hold, and my right foot was heel hooking the ridge to the right of the starting crimp. Then I moved my left hand and hammered down on the pinch, did a sort-of gaston to the upper pocket, rocked my heel hook to standing on my toe, switched feet so my left foot was where my right foot was and my right foot is flagging out to the right. Then I grabbed the deep pocket, walked my feet over to where my left foot was on the left ridge(chalk on it) and my right foot on the left starting hold as I grabbed the pinch above the deep pocket, then I did a small Dyno to grab the pocket above on the side of the middle roof with my left hand while I hammered down on the pinch with my right hand to slow the momentum, then grab the other roof pocket with my right hand, right when I have both hands in those pockets, I get my feet back on the wall, move my left hand to the finish crimp, and lastly move my right hand over to match the finish.",{200651698: 4}

Start out with somewhat heady and insecure for the grade, face and arete moves on the same line as More Choss than Moss. Upon reaching the overhanging wall, traverse right and continue up the obvious crack in the corner using great hand jams and stemming feet. The crux for me was the awkward mantle about 3/4 of the way up the route. Continue up the rest of the crack system and build an anchor on large ledge (or be prepared for a long runout and serious rope drag).""Get a horse!"", as shouted to us by one of the horseback riders upon seeing us hauling our gear up the trail, accurately describes the feeling after topping out this climb.
