Durrance,105714812,Trad,105714408,5.7+,500,6,3.4,653.0,"The Durrance route is listed as one of the 50 classic climbs in North America. A 4-6 pitch route that tops out at the summit. The climb is mainly off-width and hand-crack with a few spots of chimney. You also get the choice of working a small traverse. Don't forget to register at the Visitor's Center before and after the climb. This is a crowded route and a few minutes can mean the difference between success and failure. Either plan to arrive around 5:30 AM or, if you're fast and have headlamps, try to start in the late afternoon.  Note: All directional references in this description are accurate if you are facing the rock.  Approach: You have two choices here. To walk to the base of the 1st pitch... hike up the trail from the Visitor's Center and head to the right at the Tower trail. Almost immediately head left on a faint trail that angles up toward the base of the tower. Continue up an easy ramp to the base of the leaning column and the start of the Durrance. To climb up to the base of the 1st pitch... Continue hiking on the concrete Tower trail to the South side of the tower. You'll come to a clear path just past the leaning column as you look up. Take this path past the registration reminder sign for 5 minutes to the base of the tower and the 1st pitch of Wiessner's route. Climb this 5.4 crack to a couple of bolts about 100 feet off of the deck. Traverse left (if facing the wall) on easy 4th class to the base of the leaning column.  Pitch 1, Leaning Column (70 feet): Ascend 20 feet up a low angle crack that quickly turns vertical. Continue up another 25 feet of off-width to a horizontal crack with a piton. Enter the chimney behind the pillar and ascend another 25feet and exit onto the top of the column to a nice belay ledge with bolts.  Pitch 2, Durrance Crack (70 feet): A two crack system heads straight up for about 70 feet. The left crack is hand-width and accepts good pro for about 50 feet. The right crack is off-width and contains a large chockstone. Good pro can be found in the left hand crack until you get to the chockstone at about 55 feet. From the chockstone, depending on how tall you are, you must commit to the right crack and face the crux of the pitch. Save your #4 Camalot or equivalent to protect the crux. If you do not have anything this size, you'll probably be climbing the last 15 or so feet of this crack high above your last piece. Exit to your right onto the belay ledge with bolts. 1 Piton available about 15 feet up.  Pitch 3, Cussin' Crack (30 feet): Climb a face and off-width combo to a small ledge 20 feet up. Protect this with a number #4 or #5 stopper or equivalent on the flake to the left of the crack. From the small ledge traverse right on a 1-foot ramp to an easy and well-protected hand crack. You also have the option of continuing straight up from the small ledge in an off-width... but the right side crack is far easier. Exit onto a nice belay ledge with bolts. Be sure to run some slings from your pro to reduce rope drag if you go to the right side crack.  Pitch 4, Flake Crack (40 feet): Ascend obvious crack system on right side of huge belay ledge. A number of flakes protruding from the crack (hence the name) and some face holds for the feet will make this quite enjoyable after the off-widths lower on the route. Exit via off-width (go figure) with bomber hands onto yet another great belay ledge with bolts. Watch for some loose rock on this pitch. 1 piton is available about 15 feet up.  Pitch 5, Chockstone Crack (40 feet): Head up into a large off-width or chimney, depending on how big you are. The first 20 feet are fairly basic. The top half of this pitch is a little harder and finishes with an overhanging boulder that you must clear to exit. It will get the blood flowing, but has some decent hands to keep it relatively tame. Exit to a large belay ledge. For the first time on the route... you may be able to find some shade in a large crack on your left. Belay your second from the bolts and prepare for the jump traverse. Note: you can look down and right to spot the bolts for the second rap that you may use for your descent, they are a little harder to spot when rappelling, as they will be below you after your first rap from the summit.  Pitch 6, Jump Traverse (15 foot traverse): From the belay ledge on top of Chockstone crack, down-climb 5 feet to a small ledge. Traverse under a small roof to a horizontal finger crack. Traverse finger crack and reach back for the ledge that marks the _landing zone_ for the _jump_. Very few, if any, people actually jump on this pitch and it is not recommended. Most use the piton just around the roof to hold onto and keep the rating 5.6. If you eschew the piton, you earn a 5.8 rating for this move and the climb. Continue through a small tunnel (a nice shady spot to rest if you need it) right of the jump traverse and across the meadows to the far right crack system and climb 100 or so feet to the top. Some rope up for this section and some parties don't. Enjoy the summit.  Pitch 6 Variation, Bailey's Direct (150 feet): From the top of Chockstone crack, ascend up a 5.4 crack (left of the bolts) that goes back and forth between hands and off-width. Exit onto the summit. This finish avoids the jump traverse and has the aesthetic appeal of climbing directly to the summit. Note that the right option includes more difficult off-width moves about 40 or 50 feet off the belay.  Rappel: From the summit head back towards the top of Bailey's direct and down-climb a few feet to a rappel station. Your first rap will put you back in the meadows near the jump traverse. Down-climb to your right to some bolts below and right of the jump traverse. Make three more raps down the Bowling Alley a few hundred feet right of the Durrance route and just right of Wiessner to the base and go get some water. All raps require 2 ropes. Be careful to always rap over the nose of each pillar and NOT in the crack or else your rope will be eaten and get stuck.  Be prepared to answer all manner of questions from tourists as you race for the water fountain.  Bring lots of water and conserve it.  A truly classic climb.","{10805: 4, 106603406: 4, 106001218: 4, 105787473: 4, 10438: 4, 105799248: 4, 105812457: 4, 13248: 4, 105832474: 4, 107607978: 4, 107457432: 4, 11246: 4, 105919485: 4,

The pitch follows about 15 bolts up an off-vertical face and an arete.  The crux is midway, after the only bolt on the right side of the arete; this section is a little spicey -- the bolt is at your feet after you pull the crux but there is still a body length of insecure moves to get to the next bolt.  If you are under about 5'10"", you might find the bolt after this one placed just out of reach from the obvious clipping stance.  After the crux, the climbing eases off somewhat until you reach a ledge where you might expect to find anchors, only to find four more bolts (happily, more closely spaced) on an imposingly blank slab; fear not, this secondary crux is not as featureless as it first appears.

In other words, 5 stars on a 5 star scale.  I only climbed the first pitch, but that was all I needed to see.      Begin on the NE face around to the left from the staging area for New Wave and Broken Tree.  Look for a line of modern bolts just left of a mossy trough.  The 1st pitch follows the bolts to a belay stance below a small roof.  Though rated 5.9, it climbs much harder since nearly all of the holds on this pitch seem on the verge of breaking.  Without a doubt the worst pitch I've yet to climb at the Tower.  Even my second took a pass on this one. A good exercise in climbing lightly on loose stuff, I guess.    From the belay, the 2nd pitch looks like a short dihedral affair to the top of a pillar.  Rock quality looks sub-par to say the least. The 2nd pitch can be easily linked with the first if you are so inclined to proceed.    What attracted me to this climb was the 3rd pitch.  ""A must for aspiring Tower stemmers,"" the guide says.  Well, if that involves stemming through bushes, then no thanks.  Lots of vegetation from top to bottom, with a particularly menacing looking bush at two-thirds height.  If you go up there, definitely look out for that one.    I post the route here only to warn others about the quality discrepancy.  I don't think anyone has been up there for many, many years.  I don't know, maybe with regular traffic this would be the classic that the guide claims it to be.

Good solid small edges with decent slots for small cams lead to some large hollow blocks one must climb over (don't put pro in!) to the first crux passing a yellow step. Climb this straight up, well above a BD Micronut. Follow the easier but very runout middle arete; one could easily cut right into Mac North and get pro, but the arete proper offers fun climbing on hollow edges. At the top, where Mac North steepens into its final fingers crux, cut left up a slabby ramp and then launch up the second crux section on airy climbing up the steep face on solid edges to an exciting mantle onto the arete. From here cut right into the final 10' of Mac North.    This route offers enjoyable climbing, with distinct lower and upper sections and the middle climbing close to Mac North. However, the pro is very sparse and both crux sequences are pretty much ""don't fall"" terrain and the middle section is very runout (50') if you don't cut into Mac North.

Though rated 10d by Royal Robbins in 1964 I think most people would agree that Robbins really put up the first 5.11 on the Tower! The original route starts one crack to the left of the main crack with 2 pitons that protect a short but spicy traverse to the right to gain the main crack. Or you can do the direct start like I did at a supposed easier grade of 10c, though it still felt like 11a/b to me! With the direct start fight your way up flared and leaning fingers/hands until finally reaching good jams about 25-30 feet up. With the original start you skip out on some of the flared fingers, but instead have what looked to be a short but tricky traverse. After passing a bush the crack becomes mostly #3 and #4 camalot size for about 100 feet, turns into a really fun double cracks and then makes a traverse to the left about 20 feet below a roof. Continue from here up an offwidth (protected by a red totem/#1 camalot in a horizontal) for about 10 feet to a nice big ledge. The best gear you can get for an anchor here is #4 camalot size or larger, so save at least 1 of those. There only other anchor piece option is a tiny but decent nut placement to the right of the crack in a horizontal. For pitch 2 (5.9) continue up the wide, dirty chimney (the home of the pigeons) until you encounter a body length sized roof. A #3 and #4 protect this well. After that you are practically at the meadows. Build your own anchor. Move to the left to descend the Meadows rappels.","{106226023: 3, 106104076: 2}"

Both pitches swollow up gear and you can protect pitch 2 with as many hand-fist sized hexes and cams as you can carry.

Rappelling in two will increase the likelyhood of having your ropes hung up on the aformentioned ledge when it is pulled.","{11398: 4, 10143: 4, 13248: 4, 105870586: 4, 105919485: 4, 12842: 4, 106503119: 4, 105881068: 4, 11237: 4, 107778515: 4, 106226653: 4, 106083305: 4, 106301749: 4, 106254543: 4, 105958258: 4, 106460214: 4, 106619228: 4, 13914: 4, 106783627: 4, 106839449: 4, 106478413: 4, 106213820: 4, 106727187: 4, 106983273: 4, 107027962: 4, 107550300: 4, 108008921: 4, 108314931: 4, 108357923: 4, 107639626: 4, 107568149: 4, 105894795: 4, 106068243: 4, 105832474: 4, 105802830: 4, 107080237: 4, 107660333: 4, 108998429: 4, 106908683: 4, 106104076: 4, 111738408: 4, 110814240: 4, 107515236: 4, 111165216: 4, 109423341: 4, 107525760: 4, 111499237: 4, 109018466: 4, 108368607: 4, 110839245: 4, 107697400: 4, 108167253: 4, 106354287: 4, 112066985: 4, 107729640: 4, 110332018: 4, 108370856: 4, 108394010: 4, 111816000: 4, 112405562: 4, 200183699: 4, 108479343: 4, 200183981: 4, 107652586: 4, 200283873: 4, 106736869: 4, 111756523: 4, 111130310: 4, 7017902: 4, 106158913: 4, 200148788: 4, 200417763: 4, 105970716: 4, 200912795: 4, 107165466: 4, 106779038: 3, 105787473: 3, 105838893: 3, 107630068: 3, 13937: 3, 106847971: 3, 11725: 3, 105906992: 3, 106883214: 3, 106200408: 3, 107132514: 3, 106076401: 3, 106141870: 3, 13965: 3, 105790589: 3, 106196342: 3, 106558490: 3, 106305548: 3, 106172718: 3, 105886022: 3, 105931924: 3, 12114: 3, 13658: 3, 106585360: 3, 106747051: 3, 11759: 3, 14152: 3, 105844582: 3, 106285189: 3, 105865653: 3, 105851541: 3, 107034621: 3, 106988828: 3, 106560803: 3, 105936209: 3, 106088903: 3, 107232816: 3, 106247496: 3, 107381314: 3, 106709438: 3, 107970005: 3, 107451356: 3, 11423: 3, 11181: 3, 107458418: 3, 108779633: 3, 106813582: 3, 106032918: 3, 109723064: 3, 108117086: 3, 107650191: 3, 106911109: 3, 110429156: 3, 107131979: 3, 105892608: 3, 107022803: 3, 106098789: 3, 106830645: 3, 108659963: 3, 108330838: 3, 107800195: 3, 109143278: 3, 107367415: 3, 107742566: 3, 107586567: 3, 107939623: 3, 106954371: 3, 108172485: 3, 110957133: 3, 105906559: 3, 107933029: 3, 110325328: 3, 107890277: 3, 112027263: 3, 107370769: 3, 108779252: 3, 111752854: 3, 200054131: 3, 106788819: 3, 108392797: 3, 107743173: 3, 111134719: 3, 106767837: 3, 200107088: 3, 108533389: 3, 112050276: 3, 111752519: 3, 107051650: 3, 107870857: 3, 106959502: 3, 200160556: 3, 112472624: 3, 112342332: 3, 110320333: 3, 106087509: 3, 110851354: 3, 111347304: 3, 112254411: 3, 200051409: 3, 111927518: 3, 112421798: 3, 109329356: 3, 108242119: 3, 200064176: 3, 113187400: 3, 10270: 3, 107646553: 3, 105833503: 3, 105826344: 3, 105816622: 3, 110331339: 3, 200093542: 3, 111859893: 3, 111855857: 3, 200460481: 3, 112566669: 3, 107503776: 3, 111693310: 3, 110164501: 3, 109171331: 3, 111321805: 3, 200427850: 3, 111072569: 3, 106662918: 3, 110264676: 3, 200244605: 3, 200202771: 3, 200807931: 3, 106489136: 3, 200241111: 3, 110910691: 3, 105878859: 2, 14201: 2, 107951858: 2, 12258: 2, 106720671: 2, 10546: 2, 106696449: 2, 106394111: 2, 109316466: 2, 107937197: 2, 111009504: 2, 107818904: 2, 109877052: 2, 106202599: 2, 108226968: 2, 106597548: 2, 10168: 2, 106265516: 2, 105818656: 2, 106681828: 1, 111991578: 1}"
Extension,107300418,Trad,105714384,5.11a,140,1,1.5,2.0,"Perhaps the most well-travelled, yet rarely climbed route on Devils Tower, Extension is the crack that is commonly rappelled to descend from El Cracko or Soler. From El Cracko's first-pitch anchors, head right into a shallow but moderate finger crack that peters out into face climbing above. Pass the chains at the hanging belay, surmount the bulge, and carefully pick your way up the small dihedral with a seam. 3 well-spaced bolts protect the moves above the chains, and marginal pro can be found on occasion, but Extension is definitely more runout than most Tower routes.

Pitch starts under large roof, climb crack with some face holds passing roof on left 5.10.  climb up to foot traverse and go left to corner, climb dirty lichenous corner, sort of crumbly but good jams in the back of the crack, wear gloves.  At about half way you climb over 5 meters of loose flakes, this is the psychological crux and is quite scary.  As others have mentioned the top 1/3 of the tower is eroded and crumbly when compared to the lower 2/3.

The first pitch is essentially an approach pitch, but still fun (5.5).  The second pitch is a long seam that is a full rope length.  This originally was only possible as an aid climb, but as people kept putting larger pitons in old pin scars, the seam widened up enough to jam two fingers in each slot.  Pins are no longer used, and this is currently a free climb.  For the third pitch, climb a short 5.4 section to the meadows.    This route is pretty easy to find.  Follow the South Face approach, passing the ladder near Bon Homme.  Slightly past this point is a column separated from the tower with a bolted line up it (Roach Addition, 5.7).

Probably rated that way because you are already a little pumped when starting pitch 2.","{105787473: 4, 107539722: 4, 11237: 4, 13248: 4, 105792084: 4, 10168: 4, 10143: 4, 106159111: 4, 10185: 4, 10232: 4, 107265789: 4, 105871367: 4, 107568149: 4, 107255513: 4, 105881068: 4, 107585679: 4, 11725: 4, 14201: 4, 107707211: 4, 105906992: 4, 106883214: 4, 107300595: 4, 106076401: 4, 107254869: 4, 106433124: 4, 105828100: 4, 105802830: 4, 105915753: 4, 11341: 4, 107778515: 4, 107036187: 4, 13914: 4, 105886022: 4, 13965: 4, 106091230: 4, 106226653: 4, 106473856: 4, 105790589: 4, 14568: 4, 105978184: 4, 106305548: 4, 106255690: 4, 106254543: 4, 106087896: 4, 105973110: 4, 106030564: 4, 105931924: 4, 106106734: 4, 12114: 4, 13658: 4, 11622: 4, 106747051: 4, 11759: 4, 12513: 4, 106388352: 4, 105848096: 4, 14152: 4, 106839449: 4, 105788294: 4, 106930901: 4, 12258: 4, 106720671: 4, 106401200: 4, 106560803: 4, 105876980: 4, 105873653: 4, 106791866: 4, 106059834: 4, 106263368: 4, 106558490: 4, 107295190: 4, 105818656: 4, 106247496: 4, 10850: 4, 106365818: 4, 106161651: 4, 106398311: 4, 107027962: 4, 107630068: 4, 107671020: 4, 107550300: 4, 107240862: 4, 105801687: 4, 107605006: 4, 107356939: 4, 106039240: 4, 107598776: 4, 107965009: 4, 106158624: 4, 11423: 4, 106983273: 4, 11181: 4, 106498738: 4, 105894795: 4, 108430112: 4, 108674161: 4, 14120: 4, 106540505: 4, 107137180: 4, 108444659: 4, 107529159: 4, 109197505: 4, 105913057: 4, 107178013: 4, 109142680: 4, 107226864: 4, 105832474: 4, 107755397: 4, 107080237: 4, 107818193: 4, 13083: 4, 108779252: 4, 107591659: 4, 107468926: 4, 107660333: 4, 106690020: 4, 108123128: 4, 108684526: 4, 107650191: 4, 105934987: 4, 108998429: 4, 105892598: 4, 108330838: 4, 107143844: 4, 109639865: 4, 106430658: 4, 107774848: 4, 105890911: 4, 106104076: 4, 108628649: 4, 108160061: 4, 110814240: 4, 12949: 4, 106954371: 4, 107561580: 4, 111165216: 4, 111791753: 4, 108058146: 4, 11048: 4, 10170: 4, 105906559: 4, 108370856: 4, 106597548: 4, 110904912: 4, 111214144: 4, 108368607: 4, 108082584: 4, 109171331: 4, 107186883: 4, 106810365: 4, 111752854: 4, 110093522: 4, 106095990: 4, 108659963: 4, 200054131: 4, 106767837: 4, 107743173: 4, 112038029: 4, 200079515: 4, 106621997: 4, 106354287: 4, 112066985: 4, 107729640: 4, 110332018: 4, 107870857: 4, 108799569: 4, 108447207: 4, 112342332: 4, 107147681: 4, 112147018: 4, 110271502: 4, 200129158: 4, 107652586: 4, 200051409: 4, 200283873: 4, 111855857: 4, 105888900: 4, 106531595: 4, 111927518: 4, 200265230: 4, 200077908: 4, 111786701: 4, 200156593: 4, 110335247: 4, 200384628: 4, 109423341: 4, 200183981: 4, 112205282: 4, 108390129: 4, 108446880: 4, 200034945: 4, 107226876: 4, 200460481: 4, 109414386: 4, 200074424: 4, 107560585: 4, 106736869: 4, 109029609: 4, 105835981: 4, 112566669: 4, 109212068: 4, 107041982: 4, 107503776: 4, 200191708: 4, 111693310: 4, 200238672: 4, 200138493: 4, 200402381: 4, 200236715: 4, 200132682: 4, 200233886: 4, 111888128: 4, 200124732: 4, 112430708: 4, 107708526: 4, 200912795: 4, 200914792: 4, 107586567: 4, 108388340: 4, 106489136: 4, 200148788: 4, 10246: 3, 107572777: 3, 106936938: 3, 10481: 3, 105797501: 3, 11246: 3, 105886426: 3, 105870586: 3, 13937: 3, 105812440: 3, 106055976: 3, 107804926: 3, 107132514: 3, 10270: 3, 105797378: 3, 105942841: 3, 105911009: 3, 105824696: 3, 106603406: 3, 105084219: 3, 106398812: 3, 105990845: 3, 106440465: 3, 106540542: 3, 106585360: 3, 106207441: 3, 106348407: 3, 106995775: 3, 105851541: 3, 106452465: 3, 106301749: 3, 106162549: 3, 106074561: 3, 105822848: 3, 106308715: 3, 105936209: 3, 107228342: 3, 14537: 3, 105967115: 3, 106696449: 3, 106203980: 3, 106039936: 3, 14595: 3, 107563159: 3, 108195645: 3, 107638216: 3, 106571266: 3, 10146: 3, 107083315: 3, 106813582: 3, 107820484: 3, 106032918: 3, 108506531: 3, 110429156: 3, 107131979: 3, 109245504: 3, 106670832: 3, 106098789: 3, 106830645: 3, 11466: 3, 111009504: 3, 105797324: 3, 107800195: 3, 109557562: 3, 106202599: 3, 108871640: 3, 106816785: 3, 108226968: 3, 107643526: 3, 105813790: 3, 111522632: 3, 107923457: 3, 200061400: 3, 106802910: 3, 109653110: 3, 107929356: 3, 105826344: 3, 111060268: 3, 112050276: 3, 107201154: 3, 112421798: 3, 107054525: 3, 108344184: 3, 108479343: 3, 109143278: 3, 113187400: 3, 107613436: 3, 109877052: 3, 106442800: 3, 109846325: 3, 105833503: 3, 107220219: 3, 111756523: 3, 112207296: 3, 106158913: 3, 7017902: 3, 200292349: 3, 112472624: 3, 107821162: 3, 7130366: 3, 108578921: 3, 111231935: 3, 110019651: 3, 105934900: 2, 105828656: 2, 12448: 2, 109152722: 2, 108117086: 2, 105894418: 2, 110330725: 2, 110213399: 2, 108538771: 2}"

Climb up the face left of Soler to a first bolt and commit to Soler Eclipse.  Technical face and arete climbing leads to the first crux - a reachy lieback move to a great hold over the obvious roof.  Immediately afterwards there is another difficult crux that involves a ""I wish my shoes had C4 rubber"" move.  This brings you to the first (hanging) belay (hidden from view until now).

The curving line of Rangers are People Too is just to the left.    The first section of Space Ranger is uncharacteristic of the main line, and climbs average quality rock (with average protection) to an obvious flake stance at the base of a soaring dihedral. The remainder of the route takes the brilliant thin crack up this stemming corner, with several footholds providing rests. Numerous thin sections are made easier using face holds around the arete on the right. Protection is excellent provided you brought enough RP's, and like many Tower lines, double nines provide a bit more confidence in pulling up a big loop for the next clip.  Near the top of the corner, good TCU's protect a traverse left to a hanging flake crack (small Camalots) that leads to the anchors.

Walt Bailey,105715550,Trad,105714384,5.9,180,1,3.9,216.0,"The route is one of the best I have done anywhere.  Immaculate rock and beautiful finger and hand jams will leave a smile on any crack climber's face.  The finger crack crux comes early, but the real challenge is the sustained nature of the climb.  It gets wider and easier as you go up, but there are few rests on this route, so I found the crux to definitely be avoiding getting pumped at the top of the route.    This route is immediately left of Hollywood and Vine, and four cracks to the right of the old stake ladder.  The approach is a little tricky.  Follow the Durrance approach to the start of the third-class ledges.  I recommend racking up and leaving your packs there.  Follow the approach to Soler to the outside corner of the third-class ledges (approximately the apex of the turn of the third class ledges).  Do not climb all the way to the base of Soler.

Interesting features on the right wall and a good rest at 2/3 height help keep the difficulties manageable.     Do the amazing first pitch of One Way Sunset to get warmed up.  From the bolted anchor traverse up and left into the beautiful right facing dihedral.  After about 10 feet you can clip the first of six bolts.  The next 60 feet is unrelenting stemming with no real hand holds or good rests.  The bolts are very well placed and the falls would not be too bad.  After the sixth bolt you can get a good rest out to the right on a nice little ledge.  The upper part of the pitch is easier and protects with gear.

Both of these 3* routes are near the north-most edge of the West Face.

Climb up setting gear in the crack on the left when ever you feel like it.  There are some good jams and fingerlocks on your way, but you must stem your legs and in some places pure stemming is the only option.  Move fast and fight the burn.  Easier for taller people, but the box narrows as you get higher.  Belay at the top of the lefthand column.

The pin looked marginal so I placed a bomber large stopper. Traverse straight right on good feet to the right crack. Now place some small wires and balance up to the roof, place a small cam and crank over on finger locks (10a crux). Climb over one more small roof and a short #.75 C4 crack (5.9) to a stance with two bolts. ~90ft    P5: Climb the rotten chimney directly above (5.4) until you reach a large ledge directly below the summit. Be extremely careful not to knock any of the loose blocks in the chimney down as they will funnel directly into the stacked up climbers waiting to climb the first two pitches! From here you can climb the easier looking chimney to the left(5.4?), or the hard-to-protect crack/face directly in front of you (5.7) to two bolts.

It was bolted in 2010, worked a good bit with a couple heartbreaking near-sends and a fall from one move below the anchor. It was shelved the next season due to a blown finger tendon, and again in 2013 due to shoulder injury. I've been away from the area for much of the time since 2011, but it had always been in the back of my mind. The other local developers and climbers had generously left it be; my sincere thanks guys for letting me wrap it up, even if it took so long!    The lower 1/2 of the climb snakes its way up the face, crossing and joining Super Dihedral. It's admittedly kind of contrived, but the intention was to keep it from infringing on Super Dihedral too much while allowing a sport start to the upper arete. This is the entry fee for the spectacular arete, although the lower face does offer pretty good climbing.     Start up a steep slab, with technical tick-tacking (5.11a/b) up varied features. Stay with the bolts to find the best holds, and bounce left at the 4th bolt and pull onto the shelf. The rock is a touch dirty and friable on the slab, but the good holds are generally clean. From the shelf, crimp up good edges on the face, clipping two bolts, before moving back right into Super Dihedral just below its diagonal layback crux. Two more bolts protect this excellent stretch of laybacking, but clip them with shouldera-length draws or the rope-drag will get bad. At a large flat edge, regroup before commiting to the upper arete. The arete itself is a fantastic stretch of climbing, with lots of positive, square-cut slaps and pinches for the left and crimps/edges for the right. It's sustained and pumpy, without ever being too hard until the crux finale. This sting-in-the tail requires a sequential boulder problem on smaller features that can be taxing with the cumulative pump. What's more, the final bolt will probably be unclippable (I placed it for working, but never could figure a way to efficiently clip it on burns); simply gun it to the anchors from the 2nd to last bolt.

As the pitch flattens out the easy crack could take a 4 or 5 cam or you can just run it out to the anchor, which is just to the right of a very obvious tree.  P2 (5.7+, 70ft) - Slab climbing above the tree and past a newer sapling that can be slung as quick protection. A smaller cam can be placed too before the first bolt, which is about 20ft above the belay ledge. Five or six draws to the top, which is on a huge dirty platform below the beginning of an obvious right-facing corner. This is some of my favorite moderate slab climbing at The Shield.  At the top of P2 is where this route starts to get a little dirty. Mind your feet here if there are people climbing anything climber's right of you. Also, your belayer might appreciate it.  P3 (5.6, 50ft) - Follow the crack and right-facing dirty corner up and onto some 4th class terrain to an obvious pine wrapped with slings for rappelling. It looks like a lot of it is flaky and barely in there, though its almost all solid...  [UPDATE: a significant amount of rock fell from the P3 corner in the Spring of 2019, ripping the ""obvious tree"" atop the first pitch from the wall. P3 is still climbable at ~5.6, but different!

The difficulties begin right off the ground with a brief boulder problem to reach the first good horizontal edge.  After a quick shake the crux section begins with long opposition moves and tricky feet.  A rightward traverse ends at the route's only really good rest.  Another boulder problem leads to a sinker (often wasp-infested) two-finger pocket and more sequential movement to one last long move to a good jug just below the anchor.    This route is chipped.

Pitch 2, .12c, 40 ft: Vertical balance climbing on nice black rock up a rounded arÃªte. gets harder after the second bolt. Work both sides of the arÃªte and do some crystal cranking. Has many tricky moves and is worthwhile in its own right.  Pitch 3, .13c, 55 feet: From the final ledge, steeper moves on strange blocky slopers leads to the perfect section of laser cut, aesthetic arÃªte, with it's best quality being it's near complete lack of holds. A few degrees overhanging on the left, and vertical on the right. Bouldery compression with huge spans, micro footholds, alternately technical, balancy, and powerful. Climbs as a V8 boulder through the inobvious entry moves and the hard transition to the blankest part of the arete. A decisive move to a flat jug rail is followed by a good rest and an exposed 5.12 outro to the very top of the square-cut wall.","{107088550: 4, 105906474: 4, 110359911: 4, 107886008: 4, 108684526: 4}"

Endeavor to Persevere,106199475,Sport,105827114,5.13c,80,1,3.9,10.0,"Endeavor to Persevere tackles the steep arete on the right side of the Killer Cave. It may be the most aesthetic line in Sinks Canyon, and it is certainly one of the best in the Lander area.   Start on a large boulder, under the roof, on a side pull and a pinch. Jump up to a right hand jug, then surf out to a 4 finger gaston pocket with your left hand. Next you go up right to a vertical three finger pocket. The left hand stops at an intermediate crimp and then up to the clipping hold, a left hand crimp/pocket. Make a hard clip off this hold, then dead point off of it and a right mono, locking off to a right hand pinch/crimp with poor feet. Next go up to the undercling crack and rest here. Â This long boulder problem is probably around V8. Â Note that falling while clipping the fourth bolt would require an attentive belayer to keep you off the large boulder at the base.  There is another 13a crux pulling over the overhang onto the main part of the arete between bolt 6 and 8. It is difficult to clip bolt 8. Make sure you have good beta for this section as it sucks to fall here after having done the difficult entry numerous times (personal experience). There is a decent shake to the left of bolt 9. A 5.12 move a few bolts higher keeps you honest on the redpoint burn.  A variation called Dr. Endeavor (5.13a) skips the boulder problem at the bottom by climbing the first 3 bolts of Bush Doctor and then traversing to the right out the underclings to meet up with the 5th bolt. This is a 3 star route in its own right.","{10768: 4, 106158262: 4, 107712668: 4, 105967991: 4, 108710237: 4, 105878863: 4, 14659: 4, 105906474: 4, 110244087: 4, 106738886: 3}"

The crux comes early between the ground and the second clip. Leaders at their limit should be careful at the second clip because given the bolt spacing, a blown clip will put you very close to the deck (this is fixed...see comments below). That said, the climbing in this section is fun and engaging with sidepulls and pinches; not your standard Iris fare. It is rare to find such a moderate, long route at the Iris and thus I think this route is a real standout (many of the other longish routes are at least 11+).    After the second clip the rock angle slabs out a bit and the leader is blessed with a nearly endless supply of sinker pockets and good rock until a horizontal break at about the height of the big roof that Spurs Equal Velocity climbs through. At this point the route character changes slightly to smaller crimps and feet, though the grade stays moderate. Move up and right clipping the last few bolts and end at nearly the top of the cliff at two huge open cold shuts (though the shuts are open, you can't slip the rope through, so you will have to hang and thread the anchor).","{106202599: 4, 110133415: 4, 200051409: 4, 108061795: 4, 200192295: 4, 108349157: 4, 106271741: 4, 110148614: 4, 112194018: 3, 111259296: 3, 111878504: 3, 106830645: 3, 112090893: 3, 108256153: 3, 7130366: 3, 110390745: 3, 200189526: 3, 110608840: 3, 200489109: 3, 106139652: 3, 105980469: 3, 110625617: 3, 112287399: 3, 112069141: 3, 107923457: 3, 107813192: 3, 200139139: 3, 106953484: 3, 111565043: 3, 109037301: 3, 107407378: 3, 108684526: 3, 110359911: 3, 108628649: 3, 107982379: 3, 111599770: 3, 107402621: 3, 108082584: 3, 106193445: 3, 107178013: 3, 106121156: 3, 105894418: 3, 107742566: 3, 107286145: 3, 200129778: 3, 108092606: 3, 106139678: 3, 111085796: 3, 107941619: 3, 108981462: 3, 107294286: 2, 106775160: 2, 110822578: 2, 107529159: 2, 106047496: 2, 109618825: 2, 106372949: 2, 108406242: 2, 111976387: 2, 13777: 2, 109711410: 2, 106412178: 2, 107847782: 2, 200279250: 2, 106908071: 2, 112023884: 2, 110209164: 2, 112139698: 2, 111092753: 0}"

Although less steep that similarly graded route on the Five Ten Wall, there routes are a bit longer, and offer at least as many interesting moves.","{200177216: 4, 109176523: 4, 106983776: 4, 107563159: 4, 110566063: 3, 106503119: 3, 109520650: 3, 110750765: 3, 111929601: 3, 107407019: 3, 108536232: 3, 110359911: 3, 108628649: 3, 200896207: 3, 111499237: 3, 108256153: 3, 12023: 3, 105878863: 3, 108200547: 3, 106396621: 3, 200264456: 3, 11235: 3, 109115688: 3, 106386525: 3, 107137180: 3, 106713008: 3, 106223916: 3, 200281073: 3, 108723479: 2, 106565320: 2, 109029609: 2, 111388129: 2, 109469194: 2, 112069141: 2, 200410586: 2, 200212138: 2, 111277689: 2, 105969464: 2, 106928886: 2, 106856483: 2, 106136679: 2, 107742566: 2, 106265516: 2, 105996074: 2, 107178013: 2, 107365273: 2, 106407880: 2, 108142594: 2, 107292120: 2, 108406242: 2, 106193445: 2, 110209164: 2, 107475857: 2, 109711410: 2, 108684526: 2, 200213605: 1, 105833242: 1, 110470284: 1, 106967283: 1, 106686976: 1}"

White Buffalo,108353416,Sport,117760645,5.13d,19,1,3.0,4.0,"The White Buffalo is a stunning, house-sized boulder nestled among the pines of the Wild Iris campground.  The virtually flawless southeast face overhangs about 5 degrees, and is among the most beautiful panels of limestone in the Lander area.      Although obviously lacking in length, this line features 7 or 8 sustained, difficult moves, making this climb as continuous as many of the other .13+ lines at Wild Iris.  The climbing itself is outstanding, though out of character, utlizing miniscule edges and only a few pockets.    Begin with the only easy moves on the route, up an obvious flake feature.  Work right to a diagonal rail, then a pair of long cranks to polished edges.  The crux comes at the second bolt, with an insecure sequence to reach a deep pocket.  A few desparate moves off slippery feet lead to the lip.  It should take longer to read this page than it will to send the line!","{107886008: 4, 105878863: 3, 10768: 3, 110767772: 2}"

Could possibly be bouldered by crazy kids with lots of pads and all that.  Would probably go at V4 or thereabouts.    For the rest of us that actually clip the bolts, it goes like this:    Starts with a mono pull to a ledge and a first clip.  Then continues up through a couple more clips on underclings and sidepulls, all through overhanging stone.  The crux is then a wicked couple of crimps to pockets.

Â I looked and didn't see any route between this one and Poposer Cowboy, so I think what I am describing is Salsa for the Soul, but the photo in the guidebook for that route looks further right of what I am describing, hence my confusion. Â This route starts up an easy pocketed slab (a bit dirty with lots of sand in the pockets) until you get to a bulge where the real climbing starts. Â Surmount this bulge using some shallow 1 1/2 or 2 finger pockets to a nice clipping pocket below the steep headwall with a crack through it. Â The crux is getting through this crack, but don't expect crack climbing skills to help you too much. Â From the good pocket reach high to a sidepull/pinch/crimp then pull through to a chockstone in the crack that Â you can use to clip the next bolt.

The route as described in the book (P 190) traverses in from the far right up to a crack system above a bulge, with a few points of protection available a the bulge, then up and left around the corner to a much more obvious, shallow, right facing corner with hands to wide hands cracks.  Follow those to a ledge/horizontal and belay there on 2x bolts (100' to the ground) to the left or to the right, as you please. The book states that this is a 180' pitch, but it is about 100' in reality and retreat with a 60M rope is possible from the anchors.    Additional climbing above (5.9, trad) in a right facing system reportedly leads to a trad anchor on top, and a walk off if topped out.    A better start to the climb, harder and more direct (but not the 'Summit Feaver Direct Start') is to climb up from below the crack and bulge from very near the arete at the base.  Place a few cams in a so-so horizontal then battle your way up the right-leaning cracks to the bulge instead of traversing in from the right.  This is harder, more sustained, and all in all, protected just fine.  I imagine it has been done before, but is not documented in the Orenczak book.  (FKFA's on lead K. Arendt and then T.

Consinute up the seams on inobvious and insecure climbing, placing very small gear (nuts & cams) to make a move up and left, then back right under a bulge (cams here, still tricky) and then over the bulge on better rock and better gear.

The climbing consists of mostly hand and finger crack through several roofs with many edges for face/foot holds.  The Laramie Range guidebook mentions the route can be done in 2 pitches, however we did in 3 to avoid rope drag.    Pitch 1 (5.6)    Probably a couple of ways to start this, all of which are no harder than 5.6 and will lead to a low angle right facing corner that gradually becomes steeper. We stopped and belayed approximately 5-feet below the first roof.    Pitch 2 (5.9)    Crux pitch! Climb through the first roof (mostly hands with great feet). There is a pinched chock stone (that thing isn't coming out but it is thin) at the end of the roof that acts as a jug. Climb nice fingers to the next roof and pull through it. The next section only takes small (0.4 C4 and smaller and offsets are nice) gear and it takes a little thinking to place but it is there. This section is a little balancy and for me was the crux. Enter the overhanging chimney with a finger and hand crack in the back. A #5 Camalot was nice towards the top of the chimney. Do some awkward exposed moves and we belayed approximately 5-feet below the great roof.    Pitch 3 (5.8) The Great Roof    This thing looks like it will be 5.12 from the start of the climb but it is mostly hands and there are really good feet the whole way making most of the climbing 5.7 with a few 5.8 moves. The exposure is AWESOME here! Turning the roof isn't bad. Follow a 5.6 hand crack to the top of the formation.    Decent    There are 3 sets of rap anchors on the northeast side.

The third pitch starts with the crux, several thin 11a face moves to the bottom of the dihedral.  A BD microcam (#0 or #1) is handy when you get to the roof under the corner.  Proceed up the dihedral, using a lot of runners to minimize rope drag (5.7/5.8).  A second crux is near the top of this corner, just before you reach the bolt.

Work through a second boulder problem over a buldge (easier than the first) until you reach some moderate low-angle climbing with decent holds that characterizes the remainder of the route.","{107016396: 4, 200288342: 4, 110271502: 4, 106989995: 4, 200064872: 4, 200098575: 4, 111120251: 4, 107529159: 3, 109679606: 3, 111468613: 3, 110750765: 3, 106447086: 3, 109277227: 3, 112006439: 3, 200086922: 3, 111283990: 3, 106802910: 3, 200189298: 3, 111072798: 3, 111983900: 3, 109018466: 3, 107616773: 3, 200120032: 3, 112169632: 3, 200222568: 3, 107804329: 3, 200439040: 3, 112432698: 3, 200446052: 3, 200061717: 3, 111837866: 3, 108141805: 3, 108653005: 3, 107096937: 3, 105849814: 3, 110176031: 3, 107146196: 3, 107936845: 3, 106329264: 3, 107985072: 3, 106830645: 3, 106951836: 3, 108766448: 3, 108148612: 3, 108684526: 3, 111859893: 2, 108248734: 2, 107246511: 2, 107426373: 2, 106389004: 2, 106057391: 2, 108273603: 2, 200279523: 2, 106031999: 2, 106913599: 2, 112446503: 2, 106193445: 2, 10170: 2, 106121156: 2, 106938359: 2, 106265516: 2, 107059069: 2, 106242342: 2, 108320415: 2, 200167785: 2, 106444897: 2, 110698353: 2, 106372949: 2, 107574884: 2, 110940145: 2, 107632424: 2, 106822061: 2, 107442963: 2, 107111603: 2, 109328345: 2, 110195260: 2, 109520650: 2, 108092503: 2, 107886008: 2, 107560585: 2, 111664966: 2, 110233256: 2, 105801687: 2, 107043617: 2, 108446880: 2, 108440114: 2, 106139652: 2, 109676101: 2, 106478239: 1, 109152722: 1, 112340115: 1, 200252454: 0}"

Why not 4 stars?   One, the whole buttress is a bit crumbly compared to the routes up at Mondo Beyondo.   And two, the final 35 feet just aren't as good as the first 90 feet. Finally, if you have been paying attention to the math, you can't do this route with a single 70M rope - it is too long.  So you either have to trail a rope or if you fail to do that you will have to do a messy leaver biner rappel OR potentially a funky double rap/lower using the midpoint anchors on the route to the left.   Acck!     All this needs to jump to a 4 star route is an anchor just after the crux, say at about 95 feet, and a little traffic to clean things up.  Any civic-minded bolters out there, this would be a great service!  Make sure you add the anchors AFTER the crux (just under the little roof would be good) and it won't change the grade at all.

Cry Me A River,116115610,Trad,116115551,V13,30,1,2.0,2.0,"This classic line has it all. It is a visually striking line which stands out because it is graced with solid and fairly compact rock which has black and white mineral streaks, deep rust colored patina, and a splash of green lichen, all on a bulging ~45 degree overhanging wall!  The line is composed of three cracks. To begin the problem, start in a low, squatting position, with a very low, left hand sidepull in a small and in-cut slot in the leftmost crack (this is the lowest possible hold in the left hand crack) and your right hand gastoning in the top portion of the lowest pod in the rightmost crack, then step either foot onto the large and obvious foot rail. I used a squat start because without a pad under me for the start this felt like the exact same difficulty and movement as starting sitting on a single pad. I also used a squat start because I liked the overall aesthetic of that start more, in part because it removes the whole issue of how many pads to start on to be a legitimate send. I also assume repeat ascents will almost universally use a pad under the start as that is a standard practice.   The first move is the most difficult, and then the moves get progressively easier until a final challenging sequence right before a large horizontal about twenty feet up. The climbing is unique because the hard part is mostly jamming (not counting the starting holds, there are two other holds which are not jams and not including the starting foot rail there is one foot which is not in a crack), but it is interspersed between three separate cracks. As a result, this is one of the funnest and coolest moving crack problems I have done. After the horizontal at about twenty feet, the climbing is 5.8 or 5.9.

The crux section is fairly short and well-protected, but it is followed by a long stretch of 5.7 - 5.8 chimney that is likely to be runout. This is route #2 on the Coke Bottle overview photo.  Ascend 20' easily to two side-by-side bolts which mark the start of the difficulties. The next 15' are bulgey and the crux of the climb. Several small holds on the left keep the climbing from being too desperate. A #5 Camalot cam be walked through most of this section, but be careful as the crack gradually widens. The crux is over when you grab a chickenhead on the right from which you can reach a bolt. Continue for about 20', offwidth widening to squeeze, to another bolt, using the crack and chickenheads on the right; shortly before the 2nd bolt a large chickenhead can be draped with a full length sling. After the second bolt the crack is squeeze chimney and wider; Big bros provide most pro opportunities though another #5 Camalot coult probably be placed near the top; at any rate, you probably want some sort of gear plan for this section as it is 40 or 50' from the last bolt to the anchors. Eventually you reach a ledge which has bolt anchors about 10' to the right of the crack. Belaying at the end of the crack, rather than at the bolts, provides a more comfortable and directionally superior belay; I used a medium nut and a #4 Camalot for this anchor but a variety of different sized pieces would work.  From the belay, either rap 120' from the bolt anchors or climb Mr. Rockbiter 50' of slabby 10a with 6 bolts.  Note that much of the grunting and scraping can be avoided by stemming outside of the crack, an easier but much less secure option probably best utilized by the second.","{10315: 4, 14346: 4, 11926: 4, 105856868: 4, 14213: 4, 105826344: 4, 105896993: 4, 105832474: 4, 106533923: 4, 13937: 4, 105881068: 4, 105914958: 4, 105812440: 4, 105795871: 4, 105857129: 4, 14537: 4, 13914: 4, 105887189: 4, 106088454: 4, 105846604: 4, 106254543: 4, 105894795: 4, 13111: 4, 106455331: 4, 105886022: 4, 105942841: 4, 105874611: 4, 106305471: 4, 106439808: 4, 106573189: 4, 106612381: 4, 105805825: 4, 106974860: 4, 106158148: 4, 107469950: 4, 106354547: 4, 107165466: 4, 106414419: 4, 10185: 4, 106816817: 4, 108159301: 4, 105936209: 4, 107226326: 4, 107638654: 4, 109117485: 4, 108311593: 4, 108248789: 4, 111732234: 4, 106861594: 4, 110700542: 4, 107800195: 4, 109653110: 4, 106699022: 4, 107186883: 4, 106176200: 4, 13364: 4, 110678844: 4, 107923457: 4, 200054131: 4, 111539378: 4, 108048345: 4, 111826078: 4, 109417951: 4, 111850671: 4, 200415292: 4, 200257286: 4, 109163787: 4, 109639865: 4, 107324472: 4, 107417154: 4, 112129540: 4, 105787679: 4, 108285135: 4, 106308715: 3, 105794964: 3, 105843498: 3, 105791779: 3, 106352148: 3, 13115: 3, 106885319: 3, 106483709: 3, 106193445: 3, 107016185: 3, 106039936: 3, 106740073: 3, 106088903: 3, 107515236: 3, 109152722: 3, 107909507: 3, 107786938: 3, 108182628: 3, 108939459: 3, 108226968: 3, 107131979: 3, 107280627: 3, 111076451: 3, 106162948: 3, 109329350: 3, 106137716: 2, 107342057: 2, 108779633: 2, 109811571: 2, 10510: 1, 106755522: 1}"

The hand jam iteration of the problem was around v6, and similar to numerous other challenges around Vedauwoo in this grade range.  Fortunately(unfortunately?) someone filled in the crack with mortar, presumably to preserve the original problem.  The new iteration is solid v10, and just a touch harder than the old version, though it is a HUGE HUGE HUGE step down in aesthetics.  Anyone who thinks we need to have man made crap proliferate rock climbs to the maximum extent possible need only go look at this thing.  It is downright ugly, practically to the point of hurting ones stomach.    If this had been some honest mistake where the flake had broken off and the original problem was to be preserved, in my opinion the right thing to do would have been to get in touch with the person who opened the boulder (me) and involve them in the process of gluing the flake back in (or not, depending).  This was not done here.  Instead we have an eyesore.    Lastly, whoever chipped this boulder is just a disrespectful and ignorant person.  Their actions are the height of arrogance.  The person who put the mortar in there was trying to ""fix"" the chippers actions, so I personally hold the chipper responsible for that act as well.","{105813840: 4, 108777482: 4}"

Once inside, the chimney does extend a bit below ground level though, so if 5.7 is your limit this probably isn't a great place to be testing your mettle as a slip before making the first placement could lead to a long fall.  The business doesn't come until the top where the chimney widens and you have to exit it onto a ledge. The difficulty of the moves is height-dependent, but the protection is excellent.

Climb a hand crack in a shallow chimney, following it as it traverses left into a deeper chimney halfway up the pitch. This second flaring chimney climbs like an offwidth and ends on a big ledge. At the time of my ascent, there was a rap anchor here (cordalette around a horn).  P2. Move left on the ledge so you're in the corner system above Straight and Narrow. Climb the easy, tightening chimney until it gets too narrow to fit in. Next comes the hard part: getting out of it. Here you're forced to climb out and around a bulge in the now #5 crack. My partner was able to overcome it with wide stemming, but I was too short and resorted to ugly, flailing, desperate offwidthing.  The second pitch can also be accessed by climbing Straight and Narrow and veering right into the chimney at the top just before the anchor.  For a more pleasant outing, consider the Drainpipe Left Exit variation. The 5.9 crux is brief and well protected and the rest of the pitch is significantly easier.

In the past, this route has likely been of most interest to non-climber peakbaggers who have been known to aid their way up it, but it is a fun little climbing adventure too if you're in the area and have the skills. For the best value, climb Straight and Narrow to Drainpipe Left Exit, and finish with this.  The oversized summit boulder poses quite the challenge for the non-technical peakbagger. Luckily the boulder is spilt on one side by an overhanging, tight hands crack. Climb the short but enjoyable crack, and then scamper up low angle slab to the summit.  There is NO FIXED ANCHOR at the top. To descend, most down-aid the route, which is actually quite quick and easy.

An awkward start quickly turns into a major struggle not to get spit out.  Jamming straight on is not the solution as the hands recede into the back of the flare while the shoulders get wedged on the outside.

A walkoff can be found by going to the right, squeezing through a small hole, and descending a easy chimney.","{10393: 4, 105787473: 4, 105813840: 4, 105990845: 4, 106068044: 4, 105881068: 4, 10546: 4, 105846604: 4, 106698297: 4, 14501: 4, 110904912: 4, 107016978: 4, 111580843: 4, 107929356: 4, 200249578: 4, 106424759: 4, 200675618: 4, 200578616: 4, 112304915: 4, 106159111: 3, 13515: 3, 11836: 3, 10143: 3, 105823132: 3, 106974860: 3, 13937: 3, 105971926: 3, 107314108: 3, 105805825: 3, 107335951: 3, 107619437: 3, 107737832: 3, 106883214: 3, 105795871: 3, 14116: 3, 105998198: 3, 105811887: 3, 105886022: 3, 106089653: 3, 106128017: 3, 105791779: 3, 106396822: 3, 106229519: 3, 105822848: 3, 105854062: 3, 106781575: 3, 14537: 3, 106030564: 3, 105949578: 3, 106088454: 3, 106786669: 3, 106481875: 3, 106212586: 3, 106040109: 3, 106098789: 3, 105787348: 3, 106901183: 3, 11622: 3, 107699335: 3, 106799524: 3, 108319693: 3, 106806323: 3, 106584417: 3, 107420191: 3, 107800195: 3, 108653005: 3, 106816817: 3, 108678435: 3, 108427562: 3, 107785600: 3, 110754613: 3, 110997318: 3, 110958575: 3, 109520650: 3, 108684526: 3, 108437909: 3, 111672119: 3, 111759323: 3, 107094371: 3, 109029609: 3, 110562991: 3, 107328886: 3, 110377556: 3, 110195260: 3, 108583224: 3, 108141805: 3, 12949: 3, 109955638: 3, 108799569: 3, 109300359: 3, 111148847: 3, 110818266: 3, 110098525: 3, 112886578: 3, 112447253: 3, 112886165: 3, 106686976: 3, 112294210: 3, 111231935: 3, 110959609: 3, 113459339: 3, 108854446: 3, 111893412: 3, 200239843: 3, 107552617: 3, 106121156: 3, 200062258: 3, 111925354: 3, 109414386: 3, 110816370: 3, 107229678: 3, 109679606: 3, 200263921: 3, 112826729: 3, 112131062: 3, 112171525: 3, 111811598: 3, 111328351: 3, 108276959: 3, 200053241: 3, 107931921: 3, 200035142: 3, 109961872: 3, 112086258: 3, 200137221: 3, 108338343: 3, 200069063: 3, 200195353: 3, 106945549: 3, 110580607: 3, 111711520: 3, 200084106: 3, 7022059: 3, 200735334: 3, 200283873: 3, 111950751: 3, 200336161: 3, 200167653: 3, 200211565: 3, 107625095: 3, 111656276: 3, 200446162: 3, 112938047: 3, 200780729: 3, 109639865: 3, 200659901: 3, 200026751: 3, 200481823: 3, 200747737: 3, 200269234: 3, 200371832: 3, 200279734: 3, 200615379: 3, 108778861: 3, 200477798: 3, 200032654: 3, 108573187: 3, 200565310: 3, 106816037: 2, 107300595: 2, 11574: 2, 106308715: 2, 10123: 2, 107331012: 2, 105849578: 2, 106176200: 2, 106700300: 2, 105800279: 2, 106552563: 2, 106430658: 2, 105849992: 2, 105961674: 2, 106087077: 2, 105841324: 2, 107756574: 2, 107721626: 2, 107769118: 2, 105843822: 2, 105957766: 2, 106110467: 2, 10481: 2, 106299993: 2, 106210476: 2, 105829161: 2, 106046117: 2, 105897447: 2, 106440465: 2, 106068683: 2, 105828891: 2, 106435023: 2, 105936209: 2, 106045902: 2, 106456414: 2, 106856483: 2, 106192422: 2, 106478413: 2, 105964643: 2, 105967115: 2, 106381795: 2, 106426213: 2, 107529159: 2, 105833242: 2, 107273541: 2, 107933182: 2, 106356571: 2, 108290367: 2, 107462661: 2, 107835621: 2, 106663280: 2, 107786938: 2, 106554608: 2, 107609988: 2, 107539722: 2, 106215010: 2, 106945872: 2, 13914: 2, 108385860: 2, 107022803: 2, 107372437: 2, 110234701: 2, 108096953: 2, 108674850: 2, 107619140: 2, 109996200: 2, 106560803: 2, 109423341: 2, 105890911: 2, 107755397: 2, 106897206: 2, 111864245: 2, 106172145: 2, 110678844: 2, 107534146: 2, 108166735: 2, 106967283: 2, 106983847: 2, 109002466: 2, 111912502: 2, 106941307: 2, 110835716: 2, 111672596: 2, 108981462: 2, 111959605: 2, 107494185: 2, 112016379: 2, 107767899: 2, 108424569: 2, 110402497: 2, 109187861: 2, 108652563: 2, 7056718: 2, 112262598: 2, 111639255: 2, 108478944: 2, 109999948: 2, 107324472: 2, 14073: 2, 108119334: 2, 105826344: 2, 200078328: 2, 112476199: 2, 200067071: 2, 111977309: 2, 109448005: 2, 106002329: 2, 200417763: 2, 111673386: 2, 200449002: 2, 108228481: 2, 200124616: 2, 108933244: 2, 111977429: 2, 200455682: 2, 200424745: 2, 105787469: 1, 106884299: 1, 109125716: 1, 109152722: 1, 105849814: 1, 107535548: 1, 108744718: 1, 109811571: 1, 108674161: 1}"

Easy Jam,105751825,Trad,105745214,5.4,0,1,2.3,236.0,"Wide cracks have a well-deserved reputation for being one of the more difficult genres in our sport.  I suspect this is due to the simple observation that in wide crack climbing, technique goes a long way.  Struggling up a wide crack without technique is like climbing a steep trail on skiis- without wax: just plain miserable.    Locate Easy Jam by heading left from the parking lot, and wandering through the maze of boulders to a short slab with a nice-looking diagonal crack in it (Cornelius, 5.5, excellent).  Just left is this wide crack challenge.    Wear protective clothing- minimizing pain or discomfort is a good place to start.  Now decide which side of your body you want to have inside the crack.  Think which orientation allows for the most friction (often very helpful) while reducing any awkwardness.  In leaning wide cracks it is often advantageous to have your back against the lower angle side, so that rests can easily be found by leaning back (as opposed to being forced up against the crack).  For this route you will want your left side in.    Arrange your gear on a sling, so there is nothing on your harness to get caught.      Keep in mind that in wide cracks and chimneys you can often optimize your body position to provide added security.  Done properly, it is hard to fall out of a wide crack, although the tendency for the leader is to get too deep in a wide crack, which is not always the easiest way to climbing one.     The secret to wide cracks is focusing on your lower body.  It is the legs that do most of the pushing and stabilizing.  Use your arms to maintain your position.  For this climb, heel-toe jams with the left foot work well.  You can also torque your left knee to help.  Arm bar with your left, and move systematically: secure your arms position, then release your lower body (legs, feet) and slide them to a higher position.  Now lock them in, and slide up (don't pull) with your upper body by pushing with your legs.  Lock the upper body and repeat.    This climb is a little runout, but short. If in doubt, try it on tr.    A nice progression on the Nautilus for learning wide cracks is: Easy Jam 5.4, Baldwin's Chimney 5.4, Right Parallel Space 5.5, Piton Perch 5.6, Slit 5.7, Hamburger Crack 5.7, Candlestick 5.7, Upper Slot 5.7+.  Remember that, unfortunately, easier wide cracks tend to be squeezes, and are often poorly protected, so take this progression slowly.","{14281: 4, 111850671: 4, 112358265: 4, 111580843: 4, 111776989: 4, 107929356: 4, 200058671: 4, 200675618: 4, 200032654: 4, 106029096: 3, 106308715: 3, 10123: 3, 105787663: 3, 107756574: 3, 107619437: 3, 106068044: 3, 105811887: 3, 106089653: 3, 106396822: 3, 106229519: 3, 105949578: 3, 106088454: 3, 105787348: 3, 106901183: 3, 107699335: 3, 106799524: 3, 107469950: 3, 107800195: 3, 106816817: 3, 106554608: 3, 106698297: 3, 108678435: 3, 107619140: 3, 14501: 3, 110997318: 3, 108437387: 3, 111672119: 3, 110904912: 3, 107328886: 3, 108141805: 3, 110678844: 3, 108799569: 3, 109300359: 3, 112272262: 3, 111231935: 3, 107923457: 3, 107016978: 3, 107777498: 3, 109212068: 3, 108854446: 3, 112299011: 3, 108080856: 3, 107494185: 3, 105846604: 3, 107552617: 3, 110213399: 3, 200062258: 3, 111925354: 3, 109679606: 3, 200263921: 3, 112131062: 3, 109572431: 3, 111811598: 3, 111914207: 3, 108276959: 3, 107931921: 3, 109961872: 3, 112086258: 3, 200137221: 3, 200078328: 3, 111972029: 3, 112848933: 3, 106945549: 3, 200063475: 3, 200724973: 3, 106002329: 3, 200735334: 3, 200283873: 3, 107625095: 3, 111656276: 3, 200446162: 3, 200026751: 3, 200578616: 3, 112304915: 3, 200615379: 3, 200279734: 3, 108778861: 3, 106816037: 2, 10130: 2, 105823132: 2, 106974860: 2, 106430658: 2, 13937: 2, 105961674: 2, 106087077: 2, 107314108: 2, 105841324: 2, 105990845: 2, 107737832: 2, 107300595: 2, 10481: 2, 105998198: 2, 106210476: 2, 105829161: 2, 13914: 2, 106068683: 2, 106279370: 2, 10546: 2, 105854062: 2, 106045902: 2, 106030564: 2, 106456414: 2, 105828891: 2, 106850643: 2, 105967115: 2, 106381795: 2, 106098789: 2, 105833242: 2, 11622: 2, 106356571: 2, 107462661: 2, 106584417: 2, 108417349: 2, 108653005: 2, 109125716: 2, 107609988: 2, 106945872: 2, 107022803: 2, 108427562: 2, 107785600: 2, 107372437: 2, 108096953: 2, 107786938: 2, 108674850: 2, 109996200: 2, 106560803: 2, 110958575: 2, 108684526: 2, 108437909: 2, 107755397: 2, 107207085: 2, 109677323: 2, 107950602: 2, 110562991: 2, 14537: 2, 111864245: 2, 110377556: 2, 110195260: 2, 108583224: 2, 107309020: 2, 107534146: 2, 108166735: 2, 111862724: 2, 109002466: 2, 109955638: 2, 108867086: 2, 109029609: 2, 110818266: 2, 110098525: 2, 111148847: 2, 112886578: 2, 111971885: 2, 112886165: 2, 106686976: 2, 107535548: 2, 106967283: 2, 111672596: 2, 110959609: 2, 108981462: 2, 113459339: 2, 111959605: 2, 108856432: 2, 112016379: 2, 200239843: 2, 13364: 2, 106121156: 2, 200107185: 2, 109414386: 2, 107229678: 2, 110606185: 2, 109187861: 2, 108652563: 2, 7056718: 2, 112171525: 2, 112262598: 2, 108478944: 2, 109999948: 2, 108119334: 2, 108338343: 2, 200069063: 2, 112476199: 2, 200195353: 2, 112211649: 2, 200253280: 2, 110580607: 2, 7022059: 2, 111673386: 2, 111950751: 2, 109163787: 2, 200191203: 2, 112938047: 2, 200780729: 2, 108933244: 2, 106050613: 2, 200481823: 2, 200371832: 2, 111692889: 2, 200455682: 2, 112142591: 2, 200565310: 2, 200424745: 2, 200722419: 2, 11574: 1, 11836: 1, 106552563: 1, 105795871: 1, 105936209: 1, 105787469: 1, 106426213: 1, 107933182: 1, 109152722: 1, 108385860: 1, 109423341: 1, 107094371: 1, 106172145: 1, 106983847: 1, 112294210: 1, 111759323: 1, 105974560: 1, 108744718: 1, 109811571: 1, 112150775: 1, 108674161: 1, 109448005: 1, 200167653: 1, 108228481: 1}"

Due to the enormous ledge between ground and the slot, it is best to do this climb as 2 short pitches though the full climb is probably only 100 feet.  The guide calls this one of the best pitches of 5.10 at Vedauwoo.  It is strenuous, technical, awkward, and can be made much more difficult if you don't work the back wall of the slot.  I found it difficult compared to similarly graded mid-10s at Vedauwoo and Lumpy.  Start in the flaring hand crack below the slot.    Pitch 1: Jam the strenuous 5.8 crack 20 feet to the ledge.    Pitch 2: Jam the overhanging crack and stem the slot (crux) on super-polished feet up and out to a 5.7ish OW finish.  Belay and enjoy watching the 2nd struggle.

The start is the crux, with several off-finger jams to contend with.  After a short bit, the crack widens to hands, then fists for short little stretches.  There is a 3-bolt chain anchor below the first roof from which many people slingshot toprope (don't hog the route though!).  A 5.11- variation climbs left towards the chimney (good climbing) and a steep, hanging crack.     P2. If you want to climb the roof (5.11 something), continue through in one pitch.  The initial moves are strenuous but secure, then rounding the lip requires a bit of go-for-it.  Belay above in a recess at some fixed anchors.    P3.

Locate this beauty at the far end of the crag from the parking lot, just around the corner right from the Tubes.  The climbing is positive with excellent finger locks until you reach a distinct crux just before the crack bulges.  There are good smears for the feet on the right, and if you utilize your left toe well in the crack then relying on the shallow, technical jams at the crux won't seem so desperate.  Still, it seems that one short section is a show-stopper for a lot of climbers.  Above, the positive locks resume.  Lower off of the (new) bolts on the underside of the big bulge (this is the top of P1 of Grand Traverse) or continue up the 5.10+ crux bulge of that route (possible in one pitch).  This climb was tried many times by many climbers before Australian Kim Carrigan onsighted it, and compared it in difficulty to Fish Crack in the Valley (5.12b).  It has cleaned up considerably since then; in 1980 the crack was filled with gravel, loose bits of rock, and vegetation, and felt like 5.12 to me.

Easier, unprotected slab climbing gains the rappel anchor.","{106718153: 4, 10143: 4, 12949: 4, 10505: 4, 11387: 4, 106197556: 4, 106506620: 4, 106829444: 4, 10232: 4, 105809861: 4, 11965: 4, 105823132: 4, 105822848: 4, 14213: 4, 106535625: 4, 106533923: 4, 107272297: 4, 13937: 4, 105990845: 4, 106740382: 4, 105881068: 4, 105914958: 4, 13914: 4, 106808076: 4, 106945549: 4, 105802830: 4, 105795871: 4, 13551: 4, 106481875: 4, 105886022: 4, 105828891: 4, 15043: 4, 106088454: 4, 106188401: 4, 105876980: 4, 105952776: 4, 10188: 4, 106422819: 4, 105846604: 4, 106030564: 4, 105836027: 4, 106856483: 4, 106573189: 4, 10121: 4, 105805825: 4, 106776142: 4, 105856868: 4, 105832474: 4, 106655109: 4, 106187247: 4, 105964643: 4, 106488452: 4, 107530086: 4, 107386253: 4, 107165466: 4, 106129363: 4, 107529159: 4, 106974860: 4, 106486112: 4, 107422920: 4, 108755209: 4, 108653005: 4, 106816817: 4, 105800279: 4, 106612381: 4, 107567141: 4, 107755397: 4, 110660970: 4, 107458418: 4, 106176200: 4, 107559987: 4, 107405037: 4, 109117485: 4, 108385860: 4, 107902567: 4, 107707211: 4, 105903151: 4, 108684526: 4, 110359911: 4, 109423341: 4, 109999680: 4, 108248789: 4, 106426213: 4, 106193445: 4, 107098879: 4, 111759323: 4, 107011417: 4, 106136679: 4, 106945872: 4, 111431823: 4, 110700542: 4, 107588101: 4, 108250781: 4, 108913106: 4, 111732234: 4, 106861594: 4, 105987159: 4, 112886578: 4, 110835716: 4, 109744782: 4, 108659963: 4, 112132600: 4, 108085357: 4, 107923457: 4, 107099407: 4, 106162948: 4, 108856432: 4, 109029609: 4, 108799569: 4, 108693865: 4, 107494185: 4, 107417154: 4, 111231935: 4, 108386412: 4, 107552617: 4, 109163787: 4, 108932097: 4, 200069523: 4, 200296165: 4, 110606185: 4, 108349379: 4, 107995117: 4, 200204173: 4, 106774743: 4, 107769068: 4, 112465427: 4, 106119061: 4, 200029883: 4, 112324136: 4, 111565043: 4, 12258: 4, 111912502: 4, 112150775: 4, 108092606: 4, 111700905: 4, 106815978: 4, 111146152: 4, 108031666: 4, 112086258: 4, 108266651: 4, 111945819: 4, 111617091: 4, 107929356: 4, 109629902: 4, 200242446: 4, 106887493: 4, 106736869: 4, 107562804: 4, 109520650: 4, 112566669: 4, 110575679: 4, 200093609: 4, 200733139: 4, 108285135: 4, 10270: 4, 108478944: 4, 200248588: 4, 200244605: 4, 200219435: 4, 200300042: 4, 112082839: 4, 110739366: 4, 107804312: 4, 200342114: 4, 7041384: 4, 109638995: 4, 108983186: 4, 111656276: 4, 107459332: 4, 111934732: 4, 107625095: 4, 109187861: 4, 200251964: 4, 108048345: 4, 200336161: 4, 200283873: 4, 12114: 3, 13515: 3, 105804842: 3, 10185: 3, 106365141: 3, 106386307: 3, 105849578: 3, 107065373: 3, 107493811: 3, 14352: 3, 105942841: 3, 106254543: 3, 105791779: 3, 105894795: 3, 106396822: 3, 105887867: 3, 11622: 3, 105895298: 3, 105936209: 3, 14537: 3, 106456414: 3, 106616366: 3, 11327: 3, 105872158: 3, 106224522: 3, 106474527: 3, 10870: 3, 105927097: 3, 106158148: 3, 106039936: 3, 106816037: 3, 107462661: 3, 107469950: 3, 107420191: 3, 106554608: 3, 109152722: 3, 108242742: 3, 109597474: 3, 107935937: 3, 108092104: 3, 107575405: 3, 107515236: 3, 107328886: 3, 108088043: 3, 107909507: 3, 107786938: 3, 107767899: 3, 107356939: 3, 108779633: 3, 105826344: 3, 109422149: 3, 107328579: 3, 110213399: 3, 106444897: 3, 109242154: 3, 105874611: 3, 109782738: 3, 108226968: 3, 105890911: 3, 106180206: 3, 200054131: 3, 111906198: 3, 105953019: 3, 110731327: 3, 106767428: 3, 107118543: 3, 107535548: 3, 200083957: 3, 106088903: 3, 106251687: 3, 11287: 3, 109277025: 3, 110700545: 3, 13364: 3, 110625617: 3, 200107185: 3, 108424569: 3, 109811571: 3, 7056718: 3, 109877052: 3, 108367359: 3, 106432558: 3, 106098789: 3, 108260314: 3, 200137221: 3, 108824777: 3, 109250801: 3, 106424759: 3, 200724973: 3, 200227395: 3, 107205380: 3, 200143092: 3, 111977429: 3, 111950751: 3, 111840546: 3, 200233886: 3, 107773642: 3, 106698074: 2, 106413021: 2, 109448005: 2, 107534146: 2, 107229678: 2, 109018466: 2, 105974560: 2, 106168914: 2, 200163692: 1, 108196391: 0}"
Mother   1,105751369,Trad,105745214,5.7+,0,1,3.4,296.0,"This was described in the guide book as a classic route...deservedly so IMO!  The approach to the base of the crack is hidden.  Essentially, there is a huge pile of boulders and flakes around the base of the climb.  So, if you walk up in front of this, and take a tunnel into a cave on the left, you end up in a cave with a hole coming out that would get you there.  Instead of coming out of that hole, go all the way to the VERY back of the cave, look down to the right, and you will find a hidden easy chimney that puts you right at the base.    In any case, get to the bottom of the nice looking crack (one crack to the right from a huge chimney, Baldwin's Chimney, 5.4, that splits the whole face, and ends up at a chockstone on the left).  The first half of the pitch is wide for about 50 feet.  Wedge yourself into the thing, and heel toe your way up. I had my left side in, so, maybe rack up mostly on the right.  After about halfway, the crack becomes an excellent, and steep handcrack until it peters out, and ends on a flat section.  From the flat section, you go left to belay at the chockstone.  You will have to jump over Baldwin's Chimney to get to the chockstone.  Or, if nobody is watching, just downclimb, and cruise over to it...:)  The belay at the chockstone can be made with slings, and/or your lead rope. And you could back it up with a large cam, but, with the same 100 million ton boulder.      To get off the route, you continue up the Parabolic Slab, (5.2).  I'm reasonably sure you could also do this in the same pitch as Mother #1, and skip the chockstone belay.  Either way, this continues up, and slightly right from the end of the Mother #1 crack for about 30 feet.  It's a low-angled slab with crystals.  No pro, but, no worries (maybe a little interesting in the rain).  You can do a really fun, overhanging rappel off the back side of the slab (this is the same rappel that is shown on the back of the guidebook).

Located on the S side of the crag left of Lower Progressive, PP takes the obvious chimney line which ends right of the Parabolic Slabs overhanging side.    This climb is mostly easier chimneying and stemming (wide at points) that has a distinct crux at a chockstone.    The key to passing a chockstone in a chimney rests in your body position, which in turn depends upon how well you are using your lower body (feet, legs, etc.).  By stemming or chimneying high, less reliance on pulling with the arms is required.  On this climb, face holds and jams may help augment the pure stemming and chimneying techniques employed, but they should not overwhelm these methods.  Climb methodically, in control, and be confident that each move is reversible, and each body position is secure.

Double ropes will get you down in one rap, but a single 60 M rope requires an intermediate stop at the 1st belay station under the roof.    Other variations: MRC Left (#2, 5.7) strikes out left from the first belay on 'Direct', traverses 25' along a ledge and ascends a prominent handcrack which widens to offwidth near the top.

Unlike a lot of other hard offwidths, you can not crimp your way through the crux on this one. Technique will be your only hope, so if you don't have any, then you won't stand much of a chance. Many talented offwidth climbers have called this a .12 making it one sandbagged mofo. If you have big fist, it may be an .11. If you have small to average fists, then it is a lot harder. To add to the difficulty, you will not find much friction on this fine line, rather, the inside of the crack is a very smooth, polished patina that will leave you squeezing with all your might just to stay in there.

You can use either of two first pitches to get there:    (1)  The first pitch of Moors Crossing.  This is the obvious, SE-facing trough about 40 feet right of Penis Dimension.  Once you get past the obvious difficulties on this pitch, go up through a tunnel and continue traversing up and right behind the big flake until you are directly below the left end of the big roof (may want to do in two pitches to avoid drag).  Move up toward roof until you find the obvious belay.  If you aren't comfortable with a ""Vedauwoo 5.6"", I wouldn't use this approach.  I may be a pansy, but it seemed a little weird and non-5.6 to me.  You might want a couple of bigger cams (#4 Camalots) for the top of this pitch.     (2)  About 40 right of Moors Crossing is an obvious 5.2 chimney.  At end of chimney, continue toward roof until you find belay.    BBT traverses straight right under the roof about 80 feet to the exit chimney.  Protection is good and it's a pretty cool position.  It isn't as slabby as it looks.  The crux is getting into the chimney, and then getting out.  There is a crack on the left wall of the chimney (about 8 feet up) that takes a small cam.  Grunt your way up and belay.  There isn't much for pro on the belay, but if you move back a little, it'll be impossible to be pulled off (although a heavy second might pull you into the crack a bit).

It is a sustained, overhanging #3 to #4 Camalot crack for the first 40', then you get to a pod and the crack arcs right and pinches down to very flared, thin hands and fingers.  I know Vedauwoo very well and I have never heard of this or seen any pictures, but it is very worthy.  I won't lie, the rock quality is good in the fist crack section, but once you hit the pod and the finger crack starts the rock becomes very grainy, sharp and crystally.  I think with a few more ascents it will clean up a lot.  One reason I believe it to be an FA is the amount of cleaning I did.

My chest is around 40"", so the more secure the climbing (deeper in the chimney) the more impossible it was to breath.     At the top of the climb traverse climber's right, a good ways and find the rap anchors atop Labyrinth.",{13937: 1}

The first pitch follows the obvious trough as it tunnels up into the rock. Follow this groove placing finger-sized gear in a crack on the left until reaching a shelf before a more continous section of chimneying which turns into a squeeze of narrow proportions. After the rock gives birth to you over a chockstone, climb up a slot on the left then above and right to a large belay ledge.    P2. The second pitch follows the right-facing dihedral with large pro but easy climbing until on top of a 'flange' of rock.    P3. The third pitch face climbs with no protection right and up to a water scoop with small cracks at its top - place your first pro here. Pull over this bulge to a short section of unprotected face climbing in the groove above before joining the wide crack to the right. Follow this to the top.    It is possible to combine the first two pitches with a 60 meter rope, but I would not recommend this due to heinous rope drag. It might (?) be easier to combine the 2nd and 3rd, if so inclined.

This is a true test of flared jamming abilities, no amount of face climbing will get you up this.  Bring tape.     There is reputedly a V3/4 version which starts at the lip, which can be done as an invert problem, first done in the late '90s.

Instead of scrambling to the back of the chimney atop Satterfield's, sack up, look left, and jam desperately that evil, big chockstone. The crux for some is just getting into position. You'll need to be a yoga master or else know how to pretzel yourself around if you start with your back against the main wall (easier, until you realize you've got to spin 180).    Reach out, step left on that blank damn wall, and pray. Good luck!    (The Kelman guidebook calls this a 9. I call it sandbag.)    Descent: Rap anchors after you pull the boulder.

Edward's Crack,105751021,Trad,105745175,5.7,0,2,3.6,593.0,"Edward's Crack is THE must do route on Walt's Wall. It's hard to miss this vertical crack running the length of Walt's Wall from top to bottom that roughly divides the wall in half. Edward's climbs the wall in two fun pitches and ends with a fun ten-foot off-width crack on top.  P1. Begin just left of the two bolts that mark the Friction Slide (5.8) in a dihedral at the center of the wall. Work up and into the left-trending hand crack that has bomber protection along its entire length. Climb the crack up to a narrow ledge. Move from the ledge up and left to the main crack (good friction moves). Continue along this crack to a good belay ledge about half way up.  P2. One of the best pitches at Veedauwoo. Continue up the main crack to a slightly overhanging ten-foot off-width. The crack is a little easier if you're smaller and can fit up into it, otherwise stem and find some interesting holds up above the crack and pull through. Belay off a pine tree at the top of the wall and descend as for Walt's Wall Route. Great route!  NOTE: The pine tree belay at the immediate top out is no longer secure. Its begun to uproot from years of belaying and wind. There is another tree 10 meters to the left of the top-out.","{10186: 4, 10592: 4, 11483: 4, 10996: 4, 11225: 4, 11874: 4, 13058: 4, 107503887: 4, 105813840: 4, 106087077: 4, 105832474: 4, 14346: 4,

Where The Wild Things Are,105824300,Trad,105824297,V8,35,1,3.5,2.0,"This is a spectacular and tall boulder problem.  It starts out as very overhanging tight hands and quickly narrows to thin fingers as it rounds out a bulge, then it opens up to flared and then bomber but dirty hands as the bulge rounds over, stranding you on a shelf about twenty feet up.  Then you have to climb up some more easy but vertical terrain for about fifteen feet, popping through a hole up top to end up on top of the formation.  The last fifteen feet is strewn with good handjams and is pretty secure.  Watch out for the moss in the crack at the top of the bulge, you may want to bring out a brush on a long stick or rap down and brush this section, as the moss is thick enough to make it insecure, and you wouldn't want to fall from here.
