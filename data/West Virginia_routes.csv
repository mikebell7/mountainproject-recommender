Under The Graffiti,119113320,Trad,119113257,5.6,55,1,2.0,1.0,"Nice beginner's sandstone. This has been used by the camp for years and is bolted at the top with stainless hangers with either 3/8 or 10mm bolts. If you top rope, you might reach one hanger from the top but the other one is out of reach without rapping down a couple feet. The path back to the overlook is pretty obvious from the bottom and will require some scrambling. There are snakes in the area and this rock has lots of nice places for snakes, so check carefully before putting your hand somewhere you can't see. Don't use the sketchy wire rope wrapped around the rock on top.",{200814493: 2}

Right hand to the round knob a couple feet above slit, and left hand to the crack a couple feet directly across the main slit. Pull your left hand up to the vertical crack 3 feet directly above the first crack, as you move your left foot up to a small angled edge a couple of feet up. Right foot to main slit, and right hand to a little 2 finger crimp.

Ant Hill,107727510,Boulder,107551002,V1+,15,1,1.5,2.0,"Named ""Ant Hill"" for the ants that reside in the rock near the start. Sit start with low feet placed where you're comfortable. Try to follow the crack to the pocket at the end. Reposition and place your feet carefully to reach a pocket for your right hand. Try to avoid the flake in between; I fear it may break. Position your feet again in the most solid spots and reach above your head to a pocket for your left hand. This, I believe, would be the crux move and is a blind reach. From there follow your hands with your feet to the top. The last hold is a right hand on the peak of the rock.    After topping out, there is an easy down climb at the far end of the rock. Crash pads and spotting are still recommended.","{107719391: 2, 108416778: 1}"

Reach, with your right hand, to the small horizontal ridge where the over-hang meets the vertical rock. Match your hands to reposition your feet and body to get fully under the over-hang. Reposition again. Once comfortable, utilize the small left hand above your head to reach the 'fold' in the rock with an out turned right hand. From there, go to the left hand pocket above the over-hang. Set your right hand where you like, then bump your left hand to the small vertical lip. Lay back on your left hand and bring your feet up.

Climb the off-width for about 15' until you can step left onto a 3"" wide ledge.  Traverse the ledge left about 7 feet and when it peters out carefully step up and slightly left.  Move up the face to the center of the first 18"" deep roof.  Note the block in the center of roof with a wide to narrow crack behind it, this is fairly secure  but perhaps not secure enough for a camming unit.  There is good solid gear out to the right end of the roof which is easy to access.  Pull over the center of the 18"" roof and climb around the left side of the large white roof.  Follow the very short open book / corner crack straight up to the roof above and traverse out right on a horizontal shelf, there is a bit of broken rock here which can be avoided.  Climb over a protruding finger flake pointing to left.  I wouldn't trust any gear placed against this flake, however there is a spot for solid gear slightly above it.  Shoot straight up to the upper roof and work your way out to the lip.  A long reach over the final lip gives access to another protruding finger flake pointing to the right, once surmounting this flake your on top.  Whether top roping or leading keep your belayer out to the right side of the climb due to rockfall potential.","{106677100: 4, 200442510: 4}"

Its west facing orientation keeps it shady until early in the afternoon.  Climb a finger crack to a ledge 20 feet off the ground.  Take care executing the next moves because a fall would probably land you on the ledge. A technical move awaits you immediately after clipping the first bolt. The next couple bolts worth of climbing is easier, and takes you to the perplexing intro moves to the crux. Do a couple insecure lie back moves and then fall right into a big block. Falling slightly backwards and slapping the big block, while in the iron cross position, is definitely one of the more memorable moves at the Gorge.  The hardest moves come right after the fourth bolt. There are two distinct options here; either dyno or use another set of holds to make a long lock off move.

The moves use good rock, but there is some choss within reach, belayer beware.    The first two bolts can be clipped from on top of or just above the starting boulder. Make a long reach from undercling / sidepulls up to the 3rd bolt and continue up steep terrain to the 4th bolt. Don't stray too far left into the choss. Use two good crimps and a heel hook to reach up the face to a good stance at the 5th bolt. One more reachy sequence on crimps brings you to the final roof section.    Move right on decent holds to the 6th bolt and figure out the sequence to get a good left hand undercling. Power up hard to your choice of crimps in the next roof tier, keep the feet on and bump to a good hold in the hueco. More good holds to the left allow you to clip the hanging (old) draw on the last bolt and get a quick shake. Work left on juggy flakes and make a powerful move (a deadpoint if you are gassed) to a sidepull pinch. Then work your way to a high crimp for the tricky anchor clip.

Due to the large, easily accessible boulder behind the route, this would seem a good choice for the on sight climber.

Established in 1991, it may have been the NRG's first 5.14, and possibly one of the first of the grade in the East.  However, the FA Gus Glitch was not popular with the regular NRG crew of climbers and developers. After this line was bolted by Doug Reed and declared impossible, Glitch took the challenge to send it in the face of all the ""whiny bug"" climbers who complained about conditions and uncomfortable holds.    Most folks for years believed that Glitch did not climb the route.  However, in recent years it has been repeated (by Mike Williams, Alex Megos, and Steven Roth), and some believe that Glitch did send the route.    Regardless, start on the challenging opening Whiny Bugs (12b), before moving left under the first roof.

Another option is to rack up a few cams and head up the dihedral to the top via the ""tradgedy"" dihedral.

Dead vertical with relentless edging, this route features a nasty crux, with the opportunity to take some legitimate whippers. It's hard to imagine that sport climbing originated from routes like this, and easy to understand why routes of this style have lost their popularity. Legend has it that ""Old Master,"" Porter Jarrard, emerged briefly from the backwoods of West Virginia, for a repeat of the route in 2010. Hanging the draws on his first attempt, many years after his initial ascent, he was able to manage a redpoint. Don't expect any magic like this for yourself. This route, especially the crux, is likely to mow you down your first time up it.  The first three bolts of edging and high stepping on tiny crimps lead to a rest at the fourth bolt. Lay back some decent holds and step sequentially past the fourth bolt and then bear down on a couple more tiny crimps before reaching a resting position at the fifth bolt. The V7 technical crux awaits you. Do a frontal highstep onto a small edge at belly button height, grab a vertical potato chip sized side pull well above your head, and try to stand up as high as possible before your finger tips are severed off. Recklessly grab a right hand edge and get ready for more hideous crimps.  One more redpoint crux awaits you a bolt below the anchors. Don't blow it here because you'll never want to have to pull the technical crux again.  This route gets morning shade and also retains shade through the afternoon if leaves are on the tree. Give it a try. The route is actually quite enjoyable excluding the awkward crux, which will only appeal to masochists and those that are too strong to consider this a difficult move.",{106285308: 4}

Look to your right and see the NRG Bridge in all its glory and bask in one of Bercaw's heady masterpieces.     From the location of the bolt (which is too far right causing rope drag issues) I believe that the FA was done by climbing the initial corner to about 10 feet and instead of following the crack up and left (which seems like the most logical way to me and best protected way as well), he stepped right and moved up the delicate slab until he was able to drill the bolt (or perhaps he pre-placed the bolt on rappel). This method would be ""R"" rated and although it maybe not as physically tough, it is definitely more insecure and much more dangerous.     One option, if climbing it my way, is to not clip the bolt at all and instead rely on your last piece of gear in the crack while pulling the crux moves.

Your first good gear is at a short splitter crack. Back up your first piece because you’re about to run it out a little ways. Gently trend up and right until you find a horizontal crack. Continue up until you reach the ledge. Off of the ledge begins finger/hand crack with rounded out edges, flares and pods. You’ll want stoppers, small cams, and a  #3 BD Camalot. At the top of the splitter crack is a devious roof which I found to be the crux of the route. Rest and get ready to pull up over the second roof on good jugs. Exit the last small roof on lichen covered holds and amble up blocky, 5th class terrain until you top out on the cliff rim.  Descent: I didn’t have enough rope to rap the route with a 60m. Ideally you would bring your partner up in reverse and then you could carefully Walk climbers left (skiers right) to the top of the Decameron and rap down to the ledge where Decameron tops out. From here you can pull your rope and comfortably rap down from a slung tree.  A simple alternative would be to tag another rope up with you, sling a pine tree and double rope rap.","{112467904: 4, 112539465: 3}"

This climb and others on this section of wall see consistent runoff up to a few days after a heavy rain.  ","{106766740: 4, 106681424: 4, 107564433: 4, 107089682: 4, 106655109: 4, 106538248: 4, 107475857: 4, 106180018: 4, 106992121: 4, 106792700: 4, 107076137: 4, 106961498: 4, 107937930: 4, 107682234: 4, 106389733: 4, 108853528: 4, 106900293: 4, 109167471: 4, 106955014: 4, 107457259: 4, 11690: 4, 106126874: 4, 108875216: 4, 106344939: 4, 107327535: 4, 107031463: 4, 109389640: 4, 111488411: 4, 109707618: 4, 110877362: 4, 110817969: 4, 110770284: 4, 111767650: 4, 112261667: 4, 200065206: 4, 200035255: 4, 109159090: 4, 110678844: 4, 109892956: 4, 200119221: 4, 107051650: 4, 109137675: 4, 112220235: 4, 111607851: 4, 200281784: 4, 112433726: 4, 110930905: 4, 109472534: 4, 200167597: 4, 200061232: 4, 111955802: 4, 109789710: 4, 200207146: 4, 200147866: 4, 108625148: 4, 109409153: 4, 200482107: 4, 200644271: 4, 112212516: 4, 200782445: 4, 200160322: 4, 107563513: 4, 200631426: 4, 110262051: 4, 200474321: 4, 200229728: 4, 200405367: 4, 109017735: 4, 107034760: 3, 107671600: 3, 106403737: 3, 105952525: 3, 106234129: 3, 106251687: 3, 106736701: 3, 107251896: 3, 109430824: 3, 107663477: 3, 106736847: 3, 108994007: 3, 108015415: 3, 105967115: 3, 108277529: 3, 106903165: 3, 106762537: 3, 106478239: 3, 108395721: 3, 108961673: 3, 110853351: 3, 110659233: 3, 108332214: 3, 110334414: 3, 106447086: 3, 110299333: 3, 106038528: 3, 108735310: 3, 110330619: 3, 111634247: 3, 109316126: 3, 111097102: 3, 109076559: 3, 111882861: 3, 108692155: 3, 111806823: 3, 109200017: 3, 112028027: 3, 110240029: 3, 200064848: 3, 112354371: 3, 111687255: 3, 109759746: 3, 107059069: 3, 111921737: 3, 112155201: 3, 107801617: 3, 109113775: 3, 109155979: 3, 111145269: 3, 200162454: 3, 107602549: 3, 107696894: 3, 108424569: 3, 108047997: 3, 200180028: 3, 108119334: 3, 105798365: 3, 7031666: 3, 200288249: 3, 110244788: 3, 200121718: 3, 112783577: 3, 200269553: 3, 109124986: 3, 200238699: 3, 110820359: 3, 112505301: 3, 200062258: 3, 112171525: 3, 108827034: 3, 111692889: 3, 200146852: 3, 111244656: 3, 200183891: 3, 200168840: 3, 110839245: 3, 200340126: 3, 111754751: 3, 112863103: 3, 110914708: 3, 108790269: 3, 200467455: 3, 112059446: 3, 7022524: 3, 200394465: 3, 112522840: 3, 107739229: 3, 109868740: 3, 112154993: 3, 200106501: 3, 111239574: 3, 112299093: 3, 200144283: 3, 200469910: 3, 200363486: 3, 200158362: 3, 112147878: 3, 200631144: 3, 112133637: 3, 111857489: 3, 200981074: 3, 109683196: 3, 106919775: 2, 107216693: 2, 109679606: 2, 110120757: 2, 106717383: 2, 112247008: 2, 107560585: 2, 111151975: 2, 109392078: 2, 110735895: 2, 109585594: 2, 200062165: 2, 112006439: 2, 200223092: 2, 200041199: 2}"

The route follows an obvious line up a pillar, out an eight foot roof, then up the steep headwall to the top of the cliff.  Begin ten feet left of the bolt line and make your way up and right through a selection of good hidden hand holds. Two small cams should get you safely to the first bolt. I recommend clipping the first bolt, down climbing and then cleaning the second cam to reduce rope drag. Continue up the double arête feature on consistently good sidepulls. Get a nice restful stance at the base of the roof and do your best to decipher the cryptic sequence. This crux can feel anywhere between V3 and V6 depending on the quality of your beta. After overcoming the initial difficulties of the roof campus out and easily clip the bolt around the lip. It's nice to have a bit of a tight belay here as there is some potential to land in a sharp tree.  Rest up at the base of the headwall and then get ready to race through 30 feet of long aggressive moves. There are a couple of nice rests in the last couple bolts. You'll want to conserve energy for the off balance pocketed crux just below the anchor. This is a really long pitch so don't screw it up on the last move!

Begin by jumping off the ground to a jug and zooming to a horizontal break just below the second bolt.  Get ready for the V6 crux which involves surmounting a bulge through the use of some tricky footwork and precision deadpoints.  At this point the division line between the two routes becomes a bit blurry so climb the line of least resistance and try not to overcomplicate things.  Rest up at the sixth bolt on a dinner plate jug and then move into the second sustained crux.  Hug the overhanging arête and make some long reaches between incut pockets.  The final moves of the sequence, transitioning left around the arête, are both delicate and powerful.  It is best to climb past the eighth bolt before you attempt to clip it.    With the eighth bolt clipped all that stands between you and the chains is five more bolts of tenuous 12a slab climbing.  Embrace this solo journey as it is all but impossible for your belayer to see you.  Enjoy the exposure!    Additional Notes: Leave the first bolt unclipped and stick clip a long sling to the second bolt to reduce rope drag.  A double length draw on the final bolt makes clipping more manageable.  The route gets shade by mid day. ","{200701522: 3, 106285308: 2}"

The FAist originally scoped out this line, and planned to bolt a slightly different variation of it into a harder sport climb, but the NPS denied his application to bolt it on account of some lichen at the top of the route.  So now, instead of a sport line, we have another great addition to the NRG's lineup of hard, gear-protected faces.    Start by soloing the corner to its right for 15-20 feet, up to a ledge that is not as good as it looks from the ground.  Place a bomber 00 tcu from the corner in a horizontal, make some tenuous moves right to another good horizontal, a bomber .3 camalot, and a creaky flake.  Rest up here, you'll need it the next 25 feet are the crux!  From this stance, make some reachy moves off tiny holds up the blank orange face, placing a 1 ballnut along the way.  At a decent left crimp you can build a mini-anchor out of a 2 ballnut and a 000 c3, which will protect the crux throw from one crimp to another.  After this, the climbing gradually eases up, trends left, gets great gear, and you get to a really good rest jug.  Above this rest jug is more sequential 5.12a/b climbing on sloping pockets, about 20 feet above bomber gear.    The FA gave this climb an R safety rating because of the tiny gear under hard moves, and because of the intricacy of the placements, but if you suss this out on rappel (easily accessed from the nearby Honeymooners Ladders), it is not too bad.   An onsight attempt by anyone whose limit is 5.13 would be VERY serious, however, and possibly dangerous.","{105836955: 3, 109892956: 3, 106838822: 1}"

Judging from the plethora of reinforced crimps, Doug Reed must have been really desperate to bolt a route that eclipsed the 13- grade.  The result was a technical power endurance masterpiece.    Begin with some easy climbing to a good rest below a roof.  Once fully prepared grab some crimps, swing your feet and start to funk your way up the steep dihedral.  Long reaches between tiny glued on crimps are made possible with some ridiculous drop knees.  At the end of the dihedral battle out the roof and pull on to a spectacular arete.  A minor shake prepares you for the technical crux.    The arete crux is like no other arete move I have ever done, making it hard to describe, so you'll just have to experience it for yourself.  If given a boulder grade it would be around V7.  Once through the crux cop another rest and then wobble your way up through four more bolts of solid 5.12 arete climbing.  The climbing is tenuous with few foot holds and flawless stone (no glue on the arete).    This route is a precious commodity at the NRG.

I had a great process bringing the lead to fruition, and it is indeed a fun and very engaging challenge for those on the hunt for such a thing. It's a beautiful, colorful, blank-looking face with great rock, unique holds and just enough wandering features to make it reasonable. However, the gear is spacious and must be worked for so proceed accordingly. I head-pointed this route and I would suggest the same for all but the most bold. I asked the usual suspects; Mikey, Pat and Kenny, and they all confirmed that it likely had never been led but that's not 100% certain. It has of course been top-roped over the years because of the ease of access from Muckraker, but leading this thing is a whole other endeavor.  The name has its roots in an inside joke. Essentially, there are two types of tickle; the playful, roughhousing kind and the soft, sensual kind. When the term ""sensual tickle"" came up I said it would make a good route name. So it is. On the day of the FA I realized that the name also conveniently related because the route tickles the periphery of both Perseverance and Muckraker, and I lost my sense of touch on the lead due to freezing temps. I almost fell as a result and were that to happen at the end of the crux section things could get interesting. Like many things in life I narrowly averted disaster having begun with near-certainty.  You start as for Perseverance but don't clip its first bolt. Shuffle up and left and you'll find the first mail slot with gear options. Another body length or so higher one must jog out left to drop in the next small gear, again in a mail slot. It's now time to get it on. Connect the dots and twenty or so feet higher the final piece of gear near the end of the crux section is a #1 BD Camalot in the hole. This is a little tricky to place.

Fortunately you have a sweet no-hands rest (if you can battle away the spiders) in a pod at an obvious spot above the 3rd bolt. Pumpy climbing continues above on undercling with long reaches between sloping edges with bad feet.

Dissonance,107826096,Sport,106001166,5.13a,90,1,3.6,17.0,"Dissonance was the first 5.13 established on the Endless Wall. It has high quality stone, and a few intriguing moves, but the overall route quality does not reach the precedent set by routes likes Dial 911, Quinsana, The Racist or Black Rider. This route has got to be one of the reachiest routes at the New River Gorge, as many shorter climbers are rendered helpless at the mega undercling crux.  Begin by climbing through a roof, or simply reach past the roof with your feet on the ground if you are tall. Pulling the initial roof can be a bit challenging, but once established on the vertical face, the intensity eases for a few bolts. Expect 5.11+ climbing featuring long lock offs and technical footwork from the second to the sixth bolt. Bear down on some crimps, make some deep lock offs, and high step your way through the pre-crux between the sixth and seventh. Rest up a bit at the seventh, then launch into the engaging reachy crux. If you're six feet tall the crux is no big deal, but if you're short the crux will give you fits and likely send you packing for the RRG. Cool pocketed features and slopers guide you to the anchor.  A good strategy for attacking this route is to lower off of New World Order, hang draws and scope out the crux. It can be very difficult to spot hand holds in the crux region since the stone is pure white.","{111806823: 4, 200041199: 4, 112145814: 4, 200701522: 4, 109892956: 4, 108121087: 4, 106736847: 4, 105836955: 4, 105952525: 4, 110737852: 4, 112207022: 3, 109884427: 3, 105969464: 3, 112147878: 3, 112783577: 3, 200180028: 3, 106285308: 3}"

I'm 5'6"" and I absolutely COULD NOT reach that hold, especially using skills a 5.10 climber would need. My 5'11"" friend really had to stretch to reach it. This move is very height dependent and leads me to believe Steve Cater is 7' tall. Once you get the hold, move left and mantle up and climb to the ledge. Climb up to clip the third bolt and easier 5.10 or 5.9 climbing gets you to the fourth and 5th bolt. Here's another crux, but this is much easier to figure out. However, I would think it's more like an 11a/b crux than 10c. You need really high feet and no fear of falling. Anyway, once you get the 6th bolt clipped you're home free.

Freedom Tree,107805988,Sport,105944138,5.13d,110,1,3.8,6.0,"The freedom tree is a 35 meter journey filled with many unforgettable moves, including knee bars, iron crosses and outrageous stemming.  The appeal of this line is that each move is slightly harder than the one preceding it.  The angle gets steeper, the holds get smaller, and the voices of self doubt scream louder as you claw your way to your breaking point.  The rock starts out a bit flaky but by the time you reach the crux dihedral the quality and features of the rock are more reminiscent of limestone than sandstone.    Begin with six bolts of big moves between slopers and jugs.  Bust an iron cross move out left past the sixth bolt, and then another past the seventh bolt.  At the eighth bolt indulge in a good undercling rest, as it will be your last decent rest.    Getting to the base of the hanging dihedral is cruxy, but the next 25 feet of consistent 5.13 climbing is the real test.  Crimp your way up the dihedral on some tiny sharp edges while pasting your feet on a series of polished smears.  Body position is key here and a subtle drop knee or two can be the difference between hanging on or falling off.  Who better to describe the emotional and mental challenges of climbing this dihedral than the first ascentionist, Jerry Roberts.  Here is what Jerry had to say in an interview with seclimbers seclimbers.org/modules.php?…    For me, instead of enjoying the view and     relaxing, I always wanted to get into that slippery dihedral and get it done with.. I was never ready for it due to my quivering mind and legs. Leaving the undercling I would crank out hard steep moves to the right below the extremely glassy dihedral then barely make the clip and proceed to scumtwist my way up into this very nice orange dihedral trying to climb it by shoving my pinky in a knife blade size slot. Brian Mcray and I often spoke of this tiny little sharp slot. Then Id be reaching and moving off of 3 snot slicked 1/8 inch slopers, all the while, feet straining and thruching to somehow stick in that awful dihedral. It was a mental nightmare. Overhanging, flaring dihedral, opposition difficult. It took all I had to climb it.    Jerrys comments are spot on.  Success on the route mainly comes down to being able to keep your composure and execute extremely tenuous moves while facing the possibility of some massive whippers.

Proper Soul,107337912,Sport,105944138,5.14a,100,1,4.0,13.0,"Out of all the routes on the 3 mile long Endless Wall, Proper Soul is considered to be the crown jewel. Its no longer the hardest route on the wall but its unrivaled beauty, accessibility, and athletic moves attract climbers of all abilities to try their hand at it. It is a modern day test piece of the New River Gorge and many climbers come to the gorge with the sole intent of sending this route.    The route was originally bolted up to the beginning of the dihedral by NRG climbing pioneer Porter Jarrard. Later Brian McCray bolted the remainder of the route to the top of the cliff. Since then other notable ascents include Chris Sharma's onsight in 2008 and Brent Perkins's redpoint on traditional gear in 2010.    Proper Soul follows a meandering crack much of the way up the steepest section of the Cirque. It starts out with three bolts of easy juggy climbing before the intensity increases. After the third bolt a couple hard moves take you to a large undercling feature and an unnerving clip. With the pump already slowly starting to build enter the crux dihedral and battle your way up the slopey crack. The dihedral is sequential and pumpy but no move is particularly hard. A quick rest can even be copped once you clip the middle bolt in the dihedral.    The climbing gets more interesting the further you climb in to the dihedral. A high drop knee knee bar gets you to the end of the dihedral where you must choose the most efficient method to dismount the dihedral. With fully pumped forearms gain your composure and clip the 6th draw while standing on some bad feet. One more dynamic move takes you out of the dihedral and before you know it you're at a 95% recovery rest.    After the pump is fully diminished make your way up some sidepulls to the second crux. A V6 rightward traverse on crimps requires some aggressive heel hooks and an aggro attitude. From here you're cruising through easier climbing which includes a couple of bomber resting knee bars. Keep your composure and shake out well because its not over until you clips the chains. One more redpoint crux awaits you as you battle over the final bulge. Be ready for a standard NRG V4 grovel that doesn't let up until your full body is fully established on the final face.     This route is a true multi-crux journey.

Race through the first couple bolts of reachy crimp moves and then throw a massive deadpoint to a jug at the 5th bolt.

There is some unbelievable trick beta through this crux, including a back to the wall mission impossible sequence.

Traverse right and up a few feet to clip the second bolt with a fixed chain draw.  Climb straight over a very shallow left facing corner (technical crux) to gain a nice stance below the roof.  From here, follow excellent jug holds into the roof and head right using the large flake in the roof to gain a stance.  Continue straight up, eventually finishing on the arete to reach the anchors.  This is more of an endurance climb than it is technical.  All the holds after the 3rd bolt are jugs.

After about 35 feet of splitter, you wind up beneath a scoop and a roof.  Place some gear, the heelhook and drop-knee your way out the roof.  Even after you get established over the roof it's not over until you get to a no-hands stance beneath a large flake.

As Mike says in the guidebook, this is the showpiece crack climb of the Lake Region, with flawless rock and lots of unique, complex movement. Thin fingers and good body position awareness helpful...    As with many routes that I post on MP, there is a story behind this one. As most climbers will know, we lost two shining lights this year; Inge Perkins and Hayden Kennedy. Hayden was a good friend to so many, and when we all saw how happy he and Inge were we were elated for them. Such a tragic loss. If you don't know about these two and their incredible lives, you would do well by yourself to find out who they were.     Well, Inge participated in the deepwater solo competition that was put on this past summer at the lake, on-sighting this route along the way to her victory. You can see a wonderful film about the event here;   climbing.com/videos/wild-an…    From the conversations I've had with local folks who organized and participated in the event, Inge made a huge impression on the Fayetteville climbing community with her kind, wise and gentle nature, as well as her tenacity and undeniable climbing ability. When I decided to shoe up for this thing at the end of a long day, it was to try and honor and live up to the legacy that she and Hayden left for us. At every point on the route's semi-desperate stemming that I wanted to take or let go, I kept moving because I could recall Inge being on this route, taking it to the chains. As I made the final amazing moves out the roof to the anchor, I almost cried.     I knew Hayden far better than I did Inge. However, they were undoubtedly two of a kind. It meant a great deal to me to channel Hayden's laid-back approach with Inge's never-give-in attitude to send this thing first go. They were two Bodhisattvas, sent here to show us the way. Their lights burned fast and bright, and like the rays of those distant burned out stars in the night sky, it will take many years before the light fades...",{105931815: 4}

BC,106215459,Sport,105989765,5.13b/c,70,1,4.0,8.0,"Unlike many of the other routes in the Coliseum, B.C. requires some bouldering strength. Start with your choice of draws pre-clipped and make your way through slopey edges to some long reaches around the first roof. I recommend pre-clipping the third bolt and leaving the first two unclipped since clipping them creates some major friction around the roof. After warming up on the intro boulder problem take a seat on the ledge and rest up for the rest of the route.     The next section of the route involves meandering through and around some major bulges. The climbing is not particularly pumpy (probably only 12b or so), and resting spots are plentiful, but you'll want to climb quickly and efficiently to save some steam for the final 15 feet of the climb.     With only two bolts to the anchor things get really interesting. Get some high feet (maybe a heel hook) and move aggressively to a half inch slanted edge. The sequence goes with using the slanted edge as a right hand gaston or left hand sidepull. The gaston method is scrunchy and thrutchy while the sidepull method requires tons of static strength but less precision/luck. Skip the second to last draw and make a blind reach around a small roof to an ergonomic jug. In my mind this is the end of the B section of B.C. One more dynamic move to a pocket jug sets you up for the anchor clip. This final dramatic move justifies the split grade. The last two bolts climb like a long V7 boulder problem.     B.C. heads up the center of the Coliseum and can be identified by the huge resting ledge after the third bolt. If there is a long line for Apollo Reed, why wait around?

Locate the big sloper hold 8 feet off the deck with no holds except a good foot. You'll need some long arms to reach the start of this route. Walk into the wall with your hands up and latch on to that hold. The remainder of the route remains reachy in a few other spots especially around the 1st and 2nd bolts.

Rudaw is all over the place with his grading (perhaps he comes from a background where grades are way stiffer, maybe techy climbing is just that technical and not ""that"" hard, some of his routes clearly don't go direct through the bolt line and circumnavigate cruxes), but when you come across a good Rudaw route, you appreciate the job he has done opening new routes in our region.

There's a block here you can sling with a cordelette for an anchor (you can also get to this spot from the start of Skyline Traverse by moving left around the big flake feature on the ledge at the start of the main Skyline crack).  P2 (original route): (V2) (V3) Step out left, under La Bella Vista's fin and move left into a chimney with a steep ramp further to the left.

On the other side of these you can walk around to Luncheon Ledge and then either walk all the way down the Stairmaster or to the top of Ecstasy Junior and rap down from there.","{109759746: 4, 106656746: 4, 111803928: 4, 113187400: 4, 200015872: 4, 110225247: 4, 109554938: 4, 109316126: 4, 111356812: 4, 109470418: 4, 108088148: 4, 107866588: 4, 108511583: 4, 111999314: 4, 111899364: 4, 109500568: 4, 200256148: 4, 200191884: 4, 113170642: 4, 107786030: 4, 112349543: 4, 112084693: 4, 111687255: 4, 200371228: 4, 112332863: 4, 107240862: 4, 105788014: 4, 107635248: 4, 107232016: 4, 106766740: 4, 107267683: 4, 107792163: 4, 108187975: 4, 11687: 4, 106741672: 4, 107688474: 4, 107068235: 4, 106709438: 4, 109038770: 4, 107646553: 4, 107561202: 4, 106580951: 4, 106736701: 4, 112846784: 3, 111882861: 3, 106586268: 3, 107633023: 3, 107006657: 3, 110259494: 3, 110839245: 3, 108608330: 3, 10232: 3, 111929003: 3, 109212068: 3, 106514856: 3, 107518458: 3, 110120757: 3, 106863637: 3, 107358149: 3, 109187861: 3, 108983024: 3, 111426811: 3, 105825015: 3, 110152422: 3, 107574975: 3, 107544688: 3, 109279757: 3, 111687838: 3, 110262051: 3, 107094866: 2, 107559594: 2, 108304726: 2, 108809145: 2, 108104464: 2, 109585732: 2, 113084893: 1}"

Sling the tree for pro and move up the corner (an overhang is to the left) to another tree you can sling (sizable runout between trees). Continue climbing up on unprotectable, but decent rock, with good holds and some fun moves. You'll probably see the bolts for T&T to your right. Aim for a small overhang with a crack beneath it. Get some good gear at the overhang, then pull it on great holds (crux 1) and move up to a stance at a left-leaning crack, just below the Kauffman-Cardon Ledge. On busy weekends you can build an anchor in the cracks, otherwise move up to the K-C ledge and a two-bolt anchor.  #2: From the K-C ledge climb the wide crack that is left of Bee Sting Corner. Climb straight up to the roof (look for the old pins). Pull the roof (crux 2) on some interesting flakes and move up and left. From this point, the original route continued moving up and left but the rock is absolutely worthless, loose, rotten, hollow and dangerous, lichen-covered crap...so get some decent gear then climb straight up the face and finish to the Bee Sting Corner two-bolt rap anchor.  Rap off or just step up to Lower Broadway Ledge and head to other climbs.  Overall it's a decent line and an alternative on busy weekends. The toughest R section is right off the ground. The rest of the R climbing is on good holds and decent rock. Both cruxes are protectable. If you're comfortable leading Seneca 7's, don't mind being above your gear a ways and are looking for a decent adventure climb, this is a good option. Not for the budding 5.7 leader.  Fall and winter are the best time since the leaves will be off any of the small trees that are around the lower part of P1.

Moving slightly left just before the flake ends (as described above) is easier and safer, and is what most people do to finish. Staying with the flake system, and moving up and right past the end of the flake offers harder climbing and NO gear until a short vertical slot for a bomber cam about 15 feet above the very end of the flake - borderline R rated.

Gendarme climb shop displays some of those pitons.,"{106314501: 4, 106589820: 4, 106301735: 4, 105837211: 4, 105837907: 4, 106580951: 4, 109907430: 4, 108511583: 4, 109707618: 4, 107544688: 4, 109481146: 4, 112025048: 4, 112249640: 4, 111697802: 4, 110590584: 4, 106741672: 3, 107700510: 3, 106736701: 3, 107475857: 3, 107779099: 3, 107688474: 3, 106083305: 3, 105825015: 3, 106011891: 3, 106031999: 3, 106605044: 3, 105860008: 3, 106848900: 3, 106698074: 3, 106766740: 3, 107232016: 3, 107475383: 3, 106030548: 3, 107340553: 3, 107646553: 3, 108187975: 3, 108514216: 3, 107370769: 3, 108119334: 3, 108843325: 3, 109279757: 3, 106514856: 3, 109038770: 3, 108088148: 3, 111290894: 3, 109470418: 3, 107751353: 3, 109187861: 3, 109316126: 3, 111403802: 3, 111903631: 3, 108318893: 3, 111139937: 3, 113187400: 3, 111687838: 3, 109759746: 3, 200062165: 3, 109516598: 3, 109500568: 3, 112207296: 3, 109167471: 3, 106646308: 3, 200285503: 3, 112846784: 3, 112503068: 3, 112470261: 3, 106538248: 3, 109212068: 3, 113084893: 3, 200371228: 3, 106656746: 3, 110873869: 3, 107733126: 3, 200449567: 3, 105832216: 2, 107006657: 2, 107476654: 2, 106478239: 2, 106536997: 2, 105936209: 2, 105990845: 2, 106777584: 2, 106904560: 2, 11687: 2, 107792163: 2, 107213607: 2, 107846658: 2, 108104464: 2, 108023226: 2, 106297607: 2, 106999733: 2, 106596992: 2, 109585732: 2, 109225164: 2, 109102869: 2, 110395141: 2, 7118496: 2, 111903386: 2, 112042073: 2, 110060237: 2, 105841142: 2, 111999314: 2, 108041143: 2, 110839245: 2, 107574975: 2, 200512846: 2, 105830665: 1}"

From the stance where BTTF traverses right, go straight up over the roof to a slab.  There is gear at the lip.  Go pretty much straight up to the steep rock above aiming for a bolt which is at the crux.  Above that, a small horizontal or two leads to a vertical crack finishing just left of BTTF.  Build a gear anchor and descend as per BTTF.    A little history on the multiple names.  We climbed it ground up after rapping it to see if it was worth doing.  I was too much of a chicken to commit to the crux on lead since there was no gear to prevent smacking the slab if you blew it so I made a runout traverse right, up 6 feet then back left to the horizontals above the crux.  My wife followed, climbing the crux.  That winter we went back to put in a bolt at the crux on lead but, I bit off more than I reckoned by trying a direct start up the face below the ramp start to BTTF.  15 or so feet up with no pro (after finding the first horizontal to be a shallow flare), I was just about to pull up to the second horizontal when a hold blew and I pitched, bouncing off of Old Man's traverse ledge, falling 30+ feet total and breaking my foot.  With no pro in the fall smashed my wife into her anchor, the tree at the top of P2 of Prune, with a side collision that drove the side of her helmet into her head splitting it open, filling her helmet with blood and dazing her.  She still held the fall super solid and is my hero.  After extracting ourselves from that mess which happened on a Monday in late winter with no one around, we drove to the Petersburg hospital where a foreign exchange doc/intern/whatever tried telling my wife she was suffering from an STD and not a mild concussion.  I got a pink cast.    Needless to say, the bolt never got put in.  Some time in the next year a guy who was guiding there bolted the crux on lead after cleaning off so much lichen you could see a streak down the wall from the parking lot and not knowing it had been climbed already gave it the name in parenthesis.

Great Chimney,106855126,Trad,120033186,5.5,265,2,1.2,5.0,"Great as in ""large,"" not as in ""fantastic.""    This route is listed largely for historical completeness, as it does not (and perhaps should not) get climbed much, other than as easy access to the better climbs adjacent to it.     Both current guidebooks list this route as 5.1, although today's consensus is that it is at least a 5.5 PG/PG13. This is not a suitable beginner's route: it's a dirty, chossy adventure route. Be warned, and be ready to retreat if you get in over your head.    P1: Begin by climbing / scrambling up a loose, dirty gulley filled with blocky bulges, dirty ledges, and loose scrambles. There is pro on either side wall, and there are some trees along the way to sling. Continue up to a tree with some in-situ slings on it. OPTIONAL BELAY.    The climbing isn't great for the first half of the first pitch, but if it's chimney moves you seek, the second half of the first pitch will not disappoint. Continuing up, move up a dirt slope passing two more good sized trees and gain the main chimney below a large boulder stuck above you in the chimney. Pass under the boulder and continue up using cracks in the back wall and chimney moves. Work your way up through the blocky upper portion to a large ledge on the left. Around the corner is Mrs. Robinson and a host of other decent climbs.     P2: Continue up through the blocky gully to the top. The 2nd pitch gets a bit more overgrown but just a short ways up the pitch are two good climbs on the right wall: Craving For Pink and Hidden Gem.

Ron Jeremy,110119250,Sport,109583123,5.12a/b,65,1,2.0,1.0,"The arete... way harder than Big Johnson. Hah.     The first bolt is more of a directional so that the climber doesn't trip over the rope. Start by mantling onto the shelf to the left, then rock onto the arete using a mono and some small crimps.     Bring a #1 for the top. Possibly bring a bit more kit if going to the top of Through the Looking Glass (5.8).",{107429473: 2}

Flight School,118939329,Boulder,105877349,V3,10,1,3.0,3.0,"Fun problem in an awesome setting. Start sitting on a crimp rail in the middle of the most obvious overhanging face in the boulder field. Find good low feet and move right to a vertical pocket, then bump out left to a crimp sidepull. Compress and bring up your feet, then throw for the sloper and jug over the lip and top out straight up. Possibly harder for climbers with a smaller reach, or easier for those with a big one.","{200220214: 4, 200256063: 4, 200180782: 1}"

Move to the right and place a cam in the 2"" crack below Lemon's lip then climb over the lip or place a stopper and sling as an aider to pass over the lip, the crux of the climb. There is a nice 1"" crack to the right after you crest the lip. Use it to place pro or another aider to get your feet on the rock. Once standing on the lip there is a bolt to the left or a few nice cracks to place bomber pro. The route goes up and slightly to the left to a small flat, once here there are a few small parallel cracks for cams before going straight up to top out.",{107919471: 2}
