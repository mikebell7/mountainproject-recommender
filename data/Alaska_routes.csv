Gear to 3-4 inches will be plenty.Pitch 2: 5.7 From the anchor move right and clip a piton, follow the crack system upwards to mossy ledge with a bolted anchor, climb past the anchor following a wide crack on the left hand side, continue upwards through a clean splitter crack to a bolted anchor on the top of the diamond. Gear to 3 inches. A walk off exists here. Follow the grassy ramp right to the base of the climb.Pitch 3: 5.8. Walk to a single bolt at the base of a slab, follow the slab placing gear and clipping bolts until on the arete. Follow the arete passing bolts and gear, continue up and left over dirty moss and grass, to a ledge with a two bolt anchor. gear to 3 inches.Pitch 4: 5.9. From the anchor climb the beautiful but sadly short corner, top out onto the slab and climb right to an anchor. Gear to 1 inch.Pitch 4a: 5.10a. This pitch is a variation. Climb right to a small ledge to a wide crack. Clip a bolt that is in an odd spot then muscle your way through the chicken wings. 5.10a, gear to 5 inches, although a 6in cam would be nice to have for the top.Pitch 5: 5.10. This pitch, like the last one, is excellent. From the anchor scramble to the base of the crack, and climb the wide, steep corner. There is a piton at the top of the corner.

Part 4-I think the best way to get off this climb is to rappel one time and walk out to the Independence Mine parking. You can also rappel the pinnacle and walk back to the base of Toto.

Most of the good climbing comes after the 5th or 6th bolt. Climb past 5 bolts, then traverse out right and up skipping the 6th bolt wich sometimes has a draw. After the traverse rest on a big jug. Head left and straight up. Most people find that the last draw is hard to clip and choose to skip it. IMO the last bolt is easy to clip (what do I know). If you traverse out right on a ledge right before the last bolt you can stand on a ledge and get a good rest which downs the grade and is known as the Chikaloon escape. For the full experience do not do the Chikaloon escape.      There is also the direct variation to this route known as ""Shroom to Believe"". Instead of traversing right at the 5th bolt keep climbing up and skip the jug rest. You have to be shrooming to believe that the rest is off!

I found many of the more marshy sections to be quite difficult to walk through. Some of the tussocks in the marsh I was using to cross will hold your weight (wiggly do's); some just throw you into the boggy mosquito infested water (wobbly don'ts).The better method of approaching this cliff, IMO, is via the Tanana river. The wiggly do's are the fun little rapids. The wobbly don'ts can launch your canoe to the less preferred side; unless you had hoped to get a swim in after your climbing session, this is not a suggested method of travel. When we first TR-ed, half of the holds were wobbly don'ts. These have cleaned up for the FA, however there are a few wiggly do's that will likely fall off with time. Also, the second bolt turned wobbly don't after I added locktite; best to clip the right of the two bolts. ","{107451308: 4, 200607207: 4, 200421689: 3, 200756281: 3}"

Punchbowl Wall - Regular Route,114784101,Trad,114783996,5.6,3000,5,4.0,1.0,"The first known climb of Punchbowl Wall was completed in 1994. It is possibly the only ascent of the wall. The wall itself is just over 3,000 ft elevation at the top. The climb involves a steep approach through trees and brush to a nice ledge system at an elevation of 800 ft.. From the ledge, the granite wall has what looks to be a large crack straight up to the top. The lower section of granite has 4 pitches of moderate 5th class climbing with a mix of blocky granite climbing and a long crack system in an open book. Once above about the 1,500 ft elevation., the slope lessens significantly to around 45 degrees. What from the bottom looks to be a large crack in the upper section is actually an incredible 2,000 ft long and 3-4 ft. wide rock band that is mostly eroded into the rock wall all the way to the top. This section is made up of 4th and easy 5th class climbing. In places, the rock band is filled with brush and moss, and the climbing can take one out for short distances onto the neighboring low angle faces. If considering this climb, it is good to be aware the reason this section of rock is so clean, is that it is an avalanche zone in the winter, as well as a waterfall when it rains.  Approach:  The first issue is getting to the notch at the shoreline. We used different methods every time, a raft from a 26 ft boat, kayaks from a small excursion vessel, and even a float plane for the successful ascent. We found two ways to approach the ledge at 800 feet where the roped climbing started. To the climbers left, it is a very steep forested slope. Grab trees and work your way up through the steep brush. Once to the ledge traverse to the right. The trees are pretty open in early season, and the brush becomes very thick later in the season. Alternatively this became our standard approach, climb up the gulley/dry waterfall making a few easy 5th class moves where needed until you get to a head wall, then work your way to climbers right and then up steep brushy slopes climbing under or through brush as needed. Keep observant for bears on both sides. We liked to use rubber boots (Ketchikan sneakers) and leather gloves for the approach. Lots of devils club. The ledge at 800 feet is several feet wide in places and can support a tent or two. We have downclimbed the left approach but mostly used a rappel route down the waterfalls. The rappel anchors would not be safe 24 years later.  The Climb:  From the water, you can see what appears to be two cracks making a very tall narrow X starting from the ledge at 800 ft. We climbed the left leg of the X, and then the upper left arm of the X. (the right leg and right arm might make an interesting climb.) The notch was in the middle of the X and was reached after 4 pitches. A short pitch of 5.6 climbing was needed to get above the notch and to see the upper wall. We used a standard rack of nuts, and a selection of cams to 3”. There is a long 4” crack in pitch 4 where we used slings on chock stones. A 4” cam could be helpful here. The first 5 pitches have pretty good protection. The gradient lessens for the upper 2,000 ft the wall where the type of climbing changes with a 4th/easy 5th class gulley/rock stairway and not many places for protection. We found this section good for simul climbing. The first 5 pitches were rated 5.6, 5.4, 5.4, 5.6 and 5.6. The crux was found on the 4th pitch, a long sustained 5.6 4” crack in an open book. (fyi I recall simul climbing several feet with a 50m rope to make the notch.)  The Descent:  Our descent anchors would not be safe today 24 years later. We installed a rappel route from the top starting about 100 feet to the climbers right. We ended up with 15 double rope rappels (50m ropes) for the upper wall to the ledge at 800 ft., and 8 shorter rappels down the waterfall route through the approach section. The upper section had several sections of easy 4rth class downclimbing between various rappels. The bolts were 3/8” expansion type bolts 2 for each rappel station, 20+ years later they would be very questionable and the slings in shreds. It would be interesting to see what if anything has survived. There are not a lot of cracks to leave gear behind for the upper 2,000 ft.. The wall has been hiked up from the back side. This may be a good descent route, but not recommended to use unless already familiar with it and have a boat to pick you up. It is very steep rainforest terrain on the back side.",{200291407: 4}

The crux starts from the ground till just above the second bolt. After the second bolt, head up and across a big flake from left to right. Route continues to the right and meets a seam where it heads left to the anchors. My wife and I first accessed this route from the class 4 scramble on the south side of the crag. Upon getting on top of the I saw a man wearing either skin colored pants, or no pants at all. I had to do a double take, but sure enough around 7:30pm mid June there was a man wearing nothing but a hoodie drinking a PBR. He was nice enough to put pants on and told us he was doing some light house work, as he is building a man fort on top of the crag. This is where the route gets its name, and if on your first ascent you want to drop trow and chug a PBR, who am I to judge.",{200175308: 3}

Then there is a 20 ft face to the top of a spire. Climb above the anchor and stand on the top for a real thrill as it drops off much higher on the river side. I had my wife anchor off to a tree in the gully for a belay. This tree is about the same height as the face of the route. This was to protect me from a fall during the scramble part.,{200175308: 2}
