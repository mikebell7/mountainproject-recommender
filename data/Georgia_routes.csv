A couple of jambs (why we chose this, it was a little damp ). Now, my deep thoughts: I'm fairly familiar with climbing on the East-face of Currahee thanks a lot to the locals, but trying to find boulders by the descriptions on Mountain Project is impossible--so I just found one, cleaned the dead wood off, and climbed it. Saying it's left of the Main Face doesn't help me because I can't find the Main Face. Use words like north and west. I do like this mountain though.  The crux is in transition from the north wall to the west--the start.",{200408388: 1}

Frontal Lobe Traverse,107973554,Boulder,106322398,V3,30,1,3.0,3.0,In true Juliette fashion I decided to squeeze another route in on The Brain.  I'm sure many folks have played around all over this boulder but we'll make it official here.      This is basically a long right to left traverse of the entire Brain boulder.  It starts on the far right side of The Brain near the tree that is curving down towards the ground.  There is a small reddish incut that works as the first foot hold.  From there you move up slightly and through the easy jumbled area of Kids Rock and past the tree stump growing from the rock. Your hands should be in the small ledge/pockets above the stump.  At this point there is a slightly awkward move down to the large shelf at the stump level.  Your hands are heading towards the shelf and feet have to find some blind edges underneath the shelf.  From here it's a simple traverse across the shelf (with feet underneath) to where the shelf terminates.    The next section is the crux.  From the terminus of the shelf you use the eyelids and pockets to transition down through the start of Pinky and the Brain.  There is a thin right leaning flake way down low.  From there hands and feet have to be in position and it's a bit of a dynamic move to the split in the rock that marks where Half a Brain goes up.  From here you just reverse the moves of Half a Brain back to the far left side of the boulder.    I don't think any of the individual moves are harder than V3 but it is long and tough on the hands/forearms (at least for me)  The crux comes towards the end so that makes it more interesting.  Once you hit the Pinky and the Brain area your feet are barely off the ground so make sure you don't touch down.,"{106312909: 3, 111244123: 3, 112478418: 3}"

Climb up and over a small roof then straight up using all kinds of holds and smears.  I believe the first pitch ends when you hit the right end of the army cable.  You can follow the cable down a bit and then rap down.  We choose to push #9 all the way to the top of the main wall.  There is a belay station (two bolts) just to the right of the end of the cable.  From there you start the second pitch that follows the water stain towards the right of the main overhang.    You will run into a good size bulge towards the top and you can go left and pick up the cable that runs to the top of the Main Overhang or you can go straight up over the bulge which is way more interesting at that height.       After the bulge you will be right where the cable takes a sharp left up the right side of the main overhang.  You can continue on up the right side of the main overhang and belay from on top.  You can belay from the cable below but it's not as comfortable as on top.    It's a fun long route. Nothing to tough but the bulge on the first pitch and using the bulge on the second pitch make it better.  You could really get crazy and use the head wall or get out on the main overhang to finish instead of following the cable.  This would make the end tons tougher.

Where's Michael...?,106403361,Sport,106109942,5.11a,60,1,2.2,12.0,This is a bolted route between Dancing Girls and Return of the Jodi.  The bolts are a bit older (but still in good shape) so I'm guessing it's been there a while.  I haven't found any information about this route or what it was named.  It's not listed in the Dixie Cragger's Atlas.  On Michael Crowder's topo of White Wall it's just a blank #5 with no info.  I rated it 5.11a for now.  We didn't finish it clean and had to move back over on to Return of the Jodi at the top because it was too wet.  To me it seems harder than the 5.10s on White Wall.  If anyone has any info about the route please share.    It basically starts in between Dancing Girls and Jodi under the first bolt.  The first few moves are a scramble then the holds get scarce and pretty thin.  There aren't too many options as it is pretty smooth near the bolts and in between this route and Jodi it's pretty smooth.  The holds here are thinner than on Jodi or Think Pink.  It basically goes straight up with the bolts to your left.    As you get closer to the slanting vertical crack that is to the left of Jodi we had to bail to the right back on to Return of the Jodi.  It was still wet and there was no grip at all on the tiny ledges.  According to Crowder's topo the route goes straight up keeping the crack just to your right.  We could see the sequence of moves but it was too wet to do it.    Whatever it's name is it's not as straight forward or classic as Jodi but the moves are thinner and tougher.  They are a bit reachy and in a few places you have to almost mantle the small holds to reach the next set.  It's a tough route for sure and pretty fun. ,"{111656281: 4, 109933971: 3, 200363487: 3, 105904878: 2, 112266788: 2, 112171525: 2, 108590756: 2, 106967373: 2, 105990845: 2, 106312909: 2, 109383300: 1, 110608840: 1}"

The left undercling is a big obvious choice. The right undercling is less obvious (2-3 right hand undercling choices), so I will leave it to you to find the videos online to see what others have thought about what is the appropriate place to start. Get your feet on the wall, and start doing these incredible, tensiony, balancey, fluid moves between holds that aren't quite angled the way that you would like them.    This is often called the best problem in Rocktown (or even the south east), but that's a hard thing to say to the 99.5% of people who visit that will not be able to do it.    I think it's probably the best problem harder than v8 in Rocktown. It gets the ""best ever"" title because it is absolutely incredible, and it is incredibly hard, and we love what we can't have, right?

Core up and start slapping. For an idea of where to start as it is a little confusing Taylor McNeil has a good beta vid from back in the day. Classic compression awaits those burly enough to fight for it. A finicky to place high right heel hook leads you into the stand start but its not over until you grab the jugs on top.

Not as cool as others at a similar difficulty at Rocktown, but I'm not sure I've ever enjoyed a thrutchy one-move-wonder as much as I enjoyed this climb.    There's also a v9 sit, but unfortunately it is contrived. For that, you start on the two crimps low (the left one you can use as a kind of hook/jam thing for two fingers), and power up to the crimps and slopers in the pod at chest height.
