Dave's Juicy Single,119076403,Boulder,118138681,V2,12,1,3.0,1,Little problem on the only rock(more like choss) I could find in the state.The start holds are a jug on the left and a side pull on the right that follows the line up the face of the rock. The bottom half of the rock is compacted dirt so the feet are bad to start but if you get a leg up it is smooth sailing.First Ascent by Layne Zuelke and Ryan Zuelke in the early 90s and I found it again and reclimbed it and set a name to it.,{200793863: 3}

Start in the slight overhang with a far left hand jug, and a right hand crimp, pull up staying along the right side of the wall with good pockets, and slopes along the way up.","{200705108: 4, 200462366: 4, 200635373: 3, 200793863: 3, 200456334: 1}"
