This one makes you work for it, wishing the next bolt was just a little closer. While the bolts are well spaced, it is by no means a dangerous route, despite what your butt may be telling you.    There is a direct start that comes in from the left with two bolts and one finger sized piece of gear. It is a stout variation, but preferred if you don't have the #6 camalot or don't like offwidths. Getting off the ground is tricky and spicy. The spiciness ends after you clip the first bolt, but the rest of the climbing is thin and sustained. It was suggested that it was 11b, but I would call it closer to 11c/d.     Start at the obvious left-facing offwidth corner. This corner often runs, but can be aided. Power up the corner and onto the face above. You will reach a slabby ledge with a horizontal crack that runs across it and up the right eventually turning into a vertical crack. It is imperative that you belay here on the horizontal. P2, step up and left trending to the first bolt. Once at the first bolt the wall becomes thin and technical crystals and knobs.

It helps if the route is completely dry since many smears happen in the groove. Continue following the groove and bolts. A few small cams can be placed between a couple of the last bolts. Near the end, traverse slightly left to the anchors.",{106449553: 3}
Tom and Jerry,114031397,Trad,119449461,5.11-,180,1,4.0,1.0,"Excellent knobs and water grooving, well-protected. This route is not listed on the current topo in the kiosk.    The route starts right where the approach trail meets the Watergroove Wall. Look for two bolts down low. Make a slabby step up onto the apron to get to the first bolt. Excellent quartz knobs take you to another stance and the second bolt. Make some hard moves in the thin wide groove to gain a better stance above. Plug in a shallow but good #1 C4 and continue up the groove. Several small to finger sized pieces in a row lead to another bolt between the two grooves. Slap your way up the two grooves to the bulge overlap. Get some gear here and start into the narrow water groove. Continue up the water groove passing four more bolts and plenty of fun moderate climbing. After the 4th bolt, start to move up and right to the anchor shared with Two for One.",{106449553: 4}
Two For One,108515839,Trad,119449461,5.9,180,1,2.5,6.0,This is one of the most fun and well-protected moderates on the wall.    The crux is getting off the ground and the next few moves. Make some tenuous moves on cool crystals to gain the easier slab above. Wander up easier terrain to the first bolt. Continue up a few more bolts to reach a large slab ledge. Head up and right on the face between two watergrooves aiming for more bolts. There are many ways to finish up the last bit of climbing to the anchors.,"{106449553: 3, 105907433: 3, 106904776: 3, 112038160: 3, 200129124: 3, 200434365: 0}"
