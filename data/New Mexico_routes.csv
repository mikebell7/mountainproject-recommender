Sequential climbing right off the ground. If you are tall it is easier to reach the starting hold with the correct hand. Fun long pulls on mostly good pockets leads up to a shouldery move to the left getting into the bottom of the flake. Some good sidepulls and a pocket out left lead up the flake to a couple of slopier holds and a honking jug at the top and a great rest. From here the climbing gets somewhat sequential and progerssively more difficult as you move up into a shallow right facing corner on pockets and sidepulls. A sidepull pinch on a cobble up high allows one to reach up left out of the corner onto the huge embedded cobble, but there is only a good edge on top. Then its just a couple of more moves up and right on mostly jugs to the anchors.","{107936895: 4, 112501870: 4, 111277689: 4, 200140603: 4, 106772708: 4, 13115: 4, 108938398: 4, 107644982: 4, 107065676: 4, 107841551: 4, 107190828: 4, 108082584: 4, 107160561: 4, 107137287: 4, 106202961: 4, 105801687: 4, 106076447: 4, 106717383: 4, 106114972: 4, 106821828: 4, 106693919: 4, 107373153: 4, 111321602: 4, 200149348: 4, 111732907: 4, 7130366: 4, 105866321: 4, 112855102: 4, 200088662: 4, 107820434: 4, 112270615: 4, 200353240: 4, 106087152: 4, 200248498: 4, 110428332: 4, 109559136: 4, 110965479: 4, 110225880: 4, 200127128: 4, 107227858: 4, 109812476: 4, 112287647: 4, 109200017: 4, 105821720: 4, 200435193: 4, 109028528: 4, 107504727: 4, 105936281: 4, 14595: 4, 106200560: 4, 106184982: 4, 106220386: 4, 105827495: 4, 106428622: 4, 106043058: 4, 106454496: 4, 12407: 4, 107228211: 4, 104554704: 4, 106351162: 4, 105808624: 4, 106494476: 4, 106847186: 4, 12792: 4, 105932186: 4, 106834216: 4, 106637131: 4, 105824164: 4, 106202599: 4, 107076500: 4, 107056968: 4, 106711676: 4, 10106: 4, 106484179: 4, 106536997: 4, 106824226: 4, 106831774: 4, 106838734: 4, 106018444: 4, 107116940: 4, 11176: 4, 106500952: 4, 105815295: 4, 105787518: 4, 10150: 4, 106818931: 4, 200340996: 3, 106949749: 3, 105875148: 3, 106467090: 3, 105806690: 3, 106554725: 3, 105846604: 3, 12227: 3, 112015774: 3, 107936845: 3, 108133395: 3, 110450054: 3, 105976663: 3}"

At this point, the crux begins with a powerful lock-off, to an undercling, to set up for the crux dyno to a 2 finger pocket over the lip.  Apparently there are two potential sequences here, that involve dyno-ing with either the left or right hand (I went left).  Above the lip, easy moves lead to the chains.    Variously sources over the years have described this route as up to 13c/d.  There are also rumors that this route has been chipped since its first ascent.  Perhaps the difficulty has changed over time, but as of the fall of 2003, this route was no harder than 13b.

Step up to clip the first of three bolts, and climb some more easy terrain to clip the second. From here, tension across to the third bolt from which a short pendulum move gets you to a small foot stance and the crack.

The crux, like many of the climbs at Las Conchas, is getting off the ground. One can meander all around this wall with its many features.     For a long time this wall was top-roped off the tree at the top. Anchors and a route up this wall were bolted in late 2006.      Lines can be and have been led on this wall using gear but no one line was ever identified and the gear was funky in flaring pockets of fairly crumbly rock. For those reasons I picked one of the more natural lines on the wall and established this bolt-protected line.  Gear-protected climbing can still be done on either side of this bolted line and still make use of the bolted anchor.","{200786049: 4, 200636365: 4, 111751928: 4, 200407988: 4, 108263498: 4, 200272137: 4, 107424433: 3, 107623115: 3, 112270615: 3, 106917454: 3, 108211820: 3, 106740477: 3, 106494476: 3, 200200018: 3, 107233302: 3, 110213240: 3, 108626560: 3, 106526523: 3, 14595: 3, 200449145: 3, 110937405: 3, 7006494: 3, 200392378: 3, 106043058: 3, 105827495: 3, 113212787: 2, 108773303: 2, 112366542: 2, 200088662: 2, 110682782: 2, 113563741: 2, 107576881: 2, 112192174: 2, 106604774: 2, 108648974: 2, 108341962: 2, 111115251: 2, 200638191: 2, 112501870: 2, 110330712: 2, 105866619: 2, 106578430: 2, 112519421: 2, 108043389: 2, 105801687: 2, 106076447: 2, 111635715: 2, 200125170: 2, 106834216: 2, 106604017: 2, 105956833: 2, 105939822: 2, 106716532: 2, 106490607: 2, 106361951: 2, 107897982: 2, 106130116: 2, 107779704: 2, 105984892: 2, 106028814: 2, 105997886: 2, 105976663: 2, 105977115: 2, 105875784: 2, 106420511: 2, 108151404: 2, 106098377: 2, 200057420: 2, 110176537: 2, 111080504: 2, 107638109: 2, 107241692: 2, 106552116: 2, 109994144: 2, 110230203: 2, 108220814: 2, 106657189: 2, 108938398: 2, 108430574: 2, 105837211: 1, 108457065: 1, 106821828: 1, 105940736: 1, 106378242: 1, 110215849: 1, 106745442: 1, 111566883: 1, 106221979: 1, 110713796: 1, 106081147: 1}"

For the FA, Nat did not climb to the ""poop hole"" on Pegasus and instead stayed right adding some more pump factor. Others have since climbed it going to the Pegasus poop hole and clipping the silver link-up bolt between Pegasus and the top of Centaur--this way is much easier as it allows for a great rest before the final difficult moves into the dihedral.One last difficult move gets you into the bottom of the featured scooped & pooped dihedral.

It also has good rock (except for the start which is flaky), fun moves, and a beautiful and easy off-width portion. The crux move is getting into the offwidth.    The climb follows the wide crack and traverses right under a roof or two. After one such traverse, there is a prominent and attractive off-width which cleaves a smooth slab (about 20 ft long). Optionally you can continue traversing right passing some old poot slings, and climb a chimney variation (with a big tree in it).   OPTIONAL - the full four-pitch ""B"" variation:   What makes this route nice is that it is easy to recognize, has good rock (except for the start which is flaky), a beautiful and easy off-width portion, and a short chimney section at the top.    5.8, PG13     P1: 30 meters, 5.6.

Start up the V crack (crux), continue up and then step right and up into a vegetated area. Cross right onto a slab and then up roughly another 30 feet to a belay ledge with a good horizontal crack immediately above the ledge. This last 30 feet is difficult to protect, perhaps offering just one or two distant protection points.     P3: 35 meters, 5.7. This pitch is easier to protect than it appears. Head up the slab the easiest way, eventually passing a bolted belay beneath a thin ~8 foot vertical crack (crux). Continue up and into a huge grassy alcove left of a big green bush.     P4: ~55 meters, 5.8. Lead directly up the major crack / chimney system. Exit left at the roof above. Alternately, one can exit left about 20 feet below the roof  ~5.8 either way. Find a broad / tall flake on the left and head up to the summit. Breaking this into two pitches may be wise for communication and/or rope drag.

The easiest, and even somewhat protectable, way is to go up the middle. A large sloping ledge will take you left. Scramble (or climb, it's about 5.6) another 20 feet up to a comfortable the walkable bottom of the gully where Worth the Effort starts.    Pitch 2. (100ft) Go up a left-slanting chimney filled here and there with variously sized boulders. Your first pro will be fairly high and there are some loose chocks to watch out for. Stay in contact with the solid slab on the left all the way past the last of the boulders  as the chimney narrows to an off-width. Once past the chocks, make sure to place protection for your second. Take the clean corner to a nook under the overhang.    Pitch 3. Make a piton-protected step left onto a ledge and follow it. The ledge will become intermittent, but the hands are good. So is the exposure. Clip and old bolt and start up on smaller holds. Continue left past bird poop (no active nest) into a right-facing corner and stay in it for the rest of the climb. Your destination is the sotol against the sky line. The last third of pitch 3 can be avoided by taking off left, but you will not want to pass it up.     In a windy weather you may want to split pitch 3 in two to assure good communication with your second for the traverse section.

Follow the ledge a short distance left to a chimney. The chimney can be climbed on holds, as opposed to chimeneying it, and is protectable.

It is easy at the beginning, but steepens sharply. This is the crux. The move is protectable using the vertical crack above the bush.

Queen's Gambit,110363000,Trad,105800595,5.9-,450,5,3.2,9.0,"Queen's Gambit is located between King Me and Green Thumb. It follows line C on the old Checkerboard topo. The top pitch is said to be the original Circus Finish, but this name has since been applied to another route. It is basically a slab climb with a featured chimney for a topout.  Pitch 1 is shared with King Me. To get to it, scramble up the gully above the end of trail (left of Cross-trainer). Rocky gully is followed by slab on the left and then short section of vegetated gully to a ledge/groove on the left. Pitch 1 goes up past a horizontal crack and up the slab with three bolts to a two bolt anchor. (Protection for this pitch is basically two quick draws.)  Pitch 2: Start up the shallow, heavily featured corner (same as King Me for the first 10 feet), but continue up and left part a bolt, up on the featured right side of a roof. Climbing continues past another bolt, then mostly along the right side of the column for most of the pitch. Three more bolts protect this section, which ends at an easy traverse to the left close to the the level of the trees on the left. You can build a gear anchor or use the rap anchor at top of Green Thumb to belay from.  Pitch 3: (and Pitch 4) stay on the same section of rock delineated by two deep chimneys/gullies. Pitch 3 heads right to a more featured terrain but gradually shifts left again and ends at a two-bolt anchor.  Pitch 4: go directly up from the bolts along thin crack. Terrain will soon become much easier. Head for the alcove left of the large green bush/tree.  Pitch 5: The crux. Top out by climbing the chimney, past some chocks. Exit left below the roof onto a narrow but comfortable ledge. Take this left to a nice layback flake. Follow that up to easy ground hanging generally somewhat left and up the slab to a belay among the boulders.  Chimney-free alternative for Pitch 5: start up the wide zig-zag crack on the left to an arete. Step onto the boulders left of the chimney and follow the tops of them to where they reach the chimney about half way up to the roof (above any squeezy parts).

The pitch, while moving past several narrow ledges, will go up at a fairly constant upward angle. You should build your belay at a large horizontal crack when you see the angle ease up significantly above. The ledge here is wider, but you can still see your second down below.    Pitch 2: (5.6, 130 ft) Continue up the bulge of the buttress staying basically on the ridge line up to a steep head wall. Make your way around to wall on the right, walk cross a wide, right sloping shelf, and continue up the easy slab on the other side to a ledge below (or even above) a clump of yuccas. (Ending Pitch 2 on the large shelf while inviting is not recommended if you intend to climb Pitch 3, as having the ropes go around the yuccas would cause an unreasonable amount of rope drag for the slabby end of that pitch.)    Pitch 3: (5.7, 130 ft) Once up past the yuccas and the few boulders above them take the right-facing corner on your left. (The left facing one on the right goes too, but it's both harder climbing and less protectable one higher up in it.) Step up into the narrowing end of the corner(s) and you should be able to reach up past the vegetation on your right to protect the transition onto the ramp on the right. Go up the ramp for a few feet and then traverse right on the wide ledge into which it turns until above you you rind a short, left-facing corner with a good crack in it. From there go up within the reddish streak. Protection, while sparse, continues to be adequate. Belay at the top of the slab from the boulders there.

Worth the Effort,106374567,Trad,105800595,5.10,250,2,1.0,1.0,Two pitches of good climbing including an exciting off-width crack that escapes under a roof. The first pitch has a deceptive start: the first crack is 15ft off the ground and it isn't immediately obvious how to gain the crack. Couple this with an awkward fall into a scraggly tree if you don't get gear into the first crack and you might be intimidated. The moves are no harder than 5.9 and by making an awkward reach (easier if you're tall) you can protect the first moves before taking any big risks. Once in the crack cruise up another 70ft to a natural belay beneath a roof.    The second pitch tackles the off-width crack exiting the roof to the right. Once around the roof the crack continues for 40 ft gradually narrowing until you reach a small overlap. An exposed move at the overlap gains easier climbing to the top.

I know of a party which has done the top half of the climb in four pitches during winter. It does not have to be snow and ice, however. The technical moves, which are scattered throughout and may go over the 5.4 rating if you don't pick your route wisely, are in many cases hugely exposed.

Some of the cracks have some vegetation and dirt in them, but for the most part the climbing is clean. The route offers good variety too, throwing everything except steep face-climbing at you.    Pitch 1, 80ft: Starts with a short lay-back and continues up a grass-filled crack until it pinches down to a seam. Clip a good bolt here and begin traversing to the right on delicate slabs (5.8+). Build a belay where you turn the corner at an old button-head (backed up, of course). One can easily link up the next pitch, but the corner creates a fair bit of drag. Also it's a nice spot to watch your second. Two alternate starts: A thin seam to the right of the main start gains the belay directly and is rated 5.8R on the old topos (it felt more like 5.10R to a group I climbed with last year). The second more direct route starts farther to the right and climbs a small crack and slab past two bolts to reach the belay. This is the most direct start, but the moves past the bolts feel like 5.11 slab when I tried them, and the two bolts are rusty old 1/4"".     Pitch 2, 60ft: From the belay climb right and then up a steep hand-crack (5.9). Continue up past some small trees to a spacious ledge with a good-sized oak tree on it (and chain rappel anchors).    Pitch 3, 160ft: Head straight up a hand crack (5.7) to a second large ledge with a stunted tree on it. To the left is a pair of bolts leading to the bottom of a long, graceful crack which climbs for 100ft to a large break in a head-wall. This is the best climbing on the route (5.9+, or 5.10 in the Dennis Jackson guidebook): delicate slab moves (height dependent) gain the bottom of the crack which starts off as shallow finger-locks. The crack grows steadily in depth, allowing better finger-jams, until eventually it is large enough for tight-hands. The break in the head-wall is hand-fist jams with an awkward exit to a belay ledge. Note: the old topos break this into two pitches, belaying at the second ledge with a tree. One alternative is to extend Pitch 2 to this tree to reduce rope drag on crux moves.    Pitch 4, 160ft: Climb the 5.7 crack directly above and past a bushy oak, or take the 5.9 slab climbing to the left passing two bolts. Both options lead to a stance below a sotol bush with some tattered old bail gear and a piton/bolt. Continue up going left around the sotol to gain a clean, steep finger crack (5.9).

Tooth or Consequences,105965200,Trad,105802728,5.10a,550,4,3.9,19.0,"A striking climb with exciting moves on every pitch. The first pitch has several variations. The ""regular"" start as described in Dennis Jackson's guide is in a grass-filled crack underneath the left side of a huge roof (5.8). (This is the same start as for Tooth Decay.) At the first bolt, traverse right underneath the roof to a bolt on the corner. A variation start is to climb a thin seam/shallow-dihedral just to the right of the regular start. This is rated 5.8 R in the Rosul-Dunning topos, but felt more like 5.9+. The seam is too small except for fingertips in a few spots, and is difficult to protect. Another variation starts in the alcove around the corner to the right, and face climbs past two bolts (5.10+?) to reach the bolt on the corner of the large roof. From the bolt at the edge of the roof, follow a rising crack to the right to reach a 15 ft hand-crack in a corner. This crack goes at 5.9 with a tricky exit move to gain a brushy ledge. Easier climbing gains a large ledge next to a dying tree where a 3-bolt chain anchor is found. It is preferable to set up a gear belay on the north (climber's left) side of the tree on a spacious ledge, which will give you better views of the spectacular second pitch.    The second pitch is the best known, and perhaps most feared. Rising off to the left is 100 ft of 5.10 slab with only four bolts for protection (a piton helps protect the traverse over to the bolts). The old 1/4"" bolts are still there, but someone has been kind enough to add a second newer 3/8"" bolt next to each old bolt making the climb all that much safer. Still this pitch is quite memorable, with perfect rock and exposure. Belay at a small stance on the arete with more great exposure.    The third pitch continues up the arete on the right side for 60ft until a small overlap above a large block is reached. A difficult and committing 5.9+ mantle gains a small stance next to a bolt. From here the climb moves over to the left side of the arete  and up a small dihedral where a committing traverse move to the right is required to gain a bolted belay stance on the arete.    The last two pitches can be combined, although it may involve having some rope-drag. From the belay, climb past a bolt to the left (5.9 slab) then veer up and right under a large protruding block. Clip a bolt under the right side of the block, and fire up the thin crack/corner (5.9). If rope-drag is an issue, belay at the top of this block, otherwise take your pick of two cracks to ascend the final 50 ft. The left-hand crack is easier (5.7) but also slightly dirty.

It takes an obvious weakness up the cliff with sustained climbing on mostly good rock, and comfortable belays. Most of the belays have 2 bolts. The crux pitch tackles a headwall with beautiful exposure and clean granite.  Pitch 1 (5.7, 120ft): Climb the corner under a large roof. Once the corner going to the right side of the roof appears on your right, traverse into it instead and take it to a ledge just below the roof, where the second old 1/4"" bolt is found. Belay from the nearby modern bolts.  Pitch 2 (5.7+, 180ft): Continue up the corner/crack system for about 150 ft. At this point make an escape to a large ledge to the right (grassy in the right season) with a 2-bolt anchor.  Pitch 3 (5.8, 150ft): Climb up or around a short slab to a small overlap with a weakness with a piton in it. After cranking over this, continue up along a nearly vertical crack toward a hedgehog cactus surmounting a tricky bulge. Just below the cactus, turn left to easily reach a comfortable belay ledge with 2-bolt anchor.  Pitch 4 (5.7+, 180ft): Continue up the corner system, staying to the right of the large chock stone but returning to the chimney like corner which leads to a slab amphitheater above. Once on the open slab, veer slightly right to a good ledge with a 2-bolt anchor.  Pitch 5 (5.8, 100ft): Head up the rest of the slab toward the right edge of the headwall. Turning around the corner here is an exposed traverse with narrow crack for hands, quite exhilarating. An old, unusable hanging belay is found directly around the corner (out of sight from your belayer). Build a gear anchor in the cracks above it.  Pitch 6 (5.9, 80ft): From the hanging belay a piton can be seen on the right where 3 small rooflets break the headwall. Climb towards these. This is the crux pitch, with great exposure and very clean, almost featureless rock. Two pitons protect the first two rooflets (can be backed up with tiny cams), after which ample gear placements can be found if climbing proceeds in the corner. If the third rooflet is climbed at its weakest point, on the right, protection is much poorer. A good reach and a cool head will help surmounting these. Above the rooflets, choose one of many comfortable belay stations in a large low-angle ledge.  Pitch 7 (low 5th, 30ft): Traverse left on easy slab to arrive at a 2-bolt anchor.

Despite the bee hive within 10-15 ft of the route and an occasional scorpion, it is really fun climbing on good rock. I'm not joking.     P1 (80 ft, 5.7+): Place a cam before starting up, because pro is scarce for the first 15-20 ft and you don't want to slide down a hill into cacti. Don't worry, this part is maybe 5.6. After that you reach a good ledge area above which the goal is obvious: climb the steep, almost chimney-able gully (chimneying optional). Larger cams are useful here, so it'd be good to have at least two Camalot C4 #3s or equivalent size cams. A crux is reached ~30 ft up, and is best solved with a cam in the fist crack in front of your face and a high left foot on rock behind you. Continue up the gully for ~25 ft and then exit left out onto an obvious ledge. Build a trad anchor in the crack above, and sit comfortably on a chair-like formation as you belay others up. Should you be tempted to peel small rotten flakes off the wall at any point on P1, beware of scorpions underneath, and once at the P1 belay, start looking above and listening for bees.     P2 (120 ft, 5.7+): You're now climbing the W-facing wall rather than the more SW-facing gully. The first move of P2 - going directly up the wall from the belay - might be the technical crux of the route (""kind of a funky move"" said Ian), but fortunately it is very protectable. Consider yourself lucky if the bee hive about 30 ft above you and 10-15 ft left of the route hasn't taken serious note of your presence (i.e. if you don't have several bees closely investigating you), and continue directly up the wall. The mental crux of the route is the part where the bee hive is directly to your left during some of the hardest climbing. You can't see the hive, but its presence should be confirmed by hundreds of bees around it. About 20 ft above this, start trending slightly left until a ledge with trees is reach. Sling a tree for an anchor.    If fear of bees gets the best of you after P1, as it did for me on the first attempt to climb this route, a large horn-like feature at the P1 belay can be slung (240 cm sling or webbing), allowing you to rap down.",{110312369: 3}

We started in the groove on the right, after first scrambling onto the triangular grassy ledge at the base of it. After one large step, we shifted to the left groove for cleaner and more ambitious climbing on small holds. This was the crux of the route. But the grade did not drop much on the rest of it, which went to the right again and stayed in the right groove and/or the arete to the left of it. The finish went up the right wall to a large clump of trees on a comfortably broad shoulder.    The route was initially climbed solely as a means of top-roping the obvious and far more attractive west-facing wall around the corner to the south, but ended up offering good climbing on solid rock with a lot of harder or easier options. One could start it in the left groove, which would make it longer and likely harder.

The first ascent of this particular variation on Gertch's Half Brother is unknown, but could possibly be by Forrest Wilcox, Ian Harris, and I, 2017-12-23.  P1 (60 ft, 5.7): start in a gully midway up the west face of Gertch's Half Brother, at the bottom of the obvious line (right-leaning) of large huecos. Once past the 5.6 hueco section, do a few 5.7 moves to gain the obvious ledge above. There is an old rusty bolt about 6ft above this ledge, but we ignored it and built a belay anchor on the ledge, using some smalls cams and a nut.  P2 (60 ft, 5.9): From the P1 belay ledge, clip the old bolt and then make a move upward into the crack/dyke feature, where more pro can be found. After a narrow ledge, climb the crack up and slightly right until a ring piton is encountered. This is the crux of the route (5.9? 5.9+?). Clip the piton and then look for a red ball nut placement above. Eventually emerge onto the big ledge below the dihedral. Use a fixed ring piton and some gear for a belay.  P3 (100 ft, 5.9): head upward and slightly left from the belay piton, into a chossy-looking set of parallel cracks.

It shifts onto the north face in the final pitches, topping out near the north-most of the numerous mini-summits of Low Horn 5. Viewed from Aguirre Springs, the east face of Low Horn 5 is the most impressive rock formation between the Spire to the south and South Rabbit Ear to the north. It would therefore be surprising if the face had never been climbed previously, but we found no mention of it or evidence on the rock (i.e. no pitons or old rap gear found).     P1 (5.6, 150 ft): Climb up the obvious flake/dihedral toward a small 3-4 ft roof and continue through a more broken terrain staying slightly right of the line of the dihedral finally going left again to a bush/tree above. The tree, which is only partially alive, should not be solely relied on for an anchor but suitable cracks are available.    P2 (5.6, 80 ft): Go up the groove above the tree to a small roof which you turn on the right (climbing directly up the groove may be possible, but quite awkward with packs). Continue up more slabby terrain toward the obvious break in the large roof above. This is the first of three belay stations directly below sizeable roofs, which conveniently provide shade on a sunny day.    P3 (5.7, 120 ft): Climb up the gap in the roof above. The crux of this pitch is at the top of the gap, where handholds are sparse and a small bush in the middle of the gap complicates the situation. Above this, the climbing immediately eases to 5.5 through vegetated terrain toward the next roof system. Build an anchor below a roof once it seems like the climbing is going to get harder again.    P4 (5.8, 180 ft): Climb up the gap in the roof above and traverse slightly left along the bottom of the next roof. Despite the great exposure developing below and left, the next part gets easier the farther left you traverse. Once it seems feasible to mount this chest level roof (crux of the route so far), do so and then continue on slightly easier ground up and to the right. Traverse up and right along vertical rock with plentiful but not-obvious handholds. Build an anchor in a weakness below the roofs above. This is the least comfortable of the belay stations below roofs, but still not bad.    P5 (5.9, 150 ft): Traverse right and up, staying on the all too smooth and steep apron under stacked roofs on your left, with not much in a way of cracks under them, and truly extreme exposure developing down to the right. Eventually the roofs run out and are replaced by a steep slab with few holds but thankfully some pro. After that, it becomes necessary to transition to the right edge, emerging from the slab onto an exceedingly narrow and quite steep ramp on the north face of Low Horn 5. After 20-30 feet of extremely-exposed, highly-precarious climbing on the somewhat dirty ramp, it becomes possible to mantle the chest/head level vertical wall to your left. The move is, thankfully, fully protectable. The pitch is quite sustained and the crux is either transitioning from the apron onto the slab or climbing the narrow ramp toward the end. Belay is at a tree on a wide ledge.    P6 (5.5, 200 ft): With the hard parts behind you, run the rope out up the easy-looking gully above and build on a comfortable ledge on the north face of the Low Horn 5.    P7 (5.6, 80 ft): Climb straight up over easy rock and build an anchor at the top.

Pirates of the Carabiner,113862729,Trad,108540309,5.7,1000,7,2.5,2.0,"This huge route is probably the easiest way up the giant east face of Little Squaretop Massif. It starts directly in the middle of the face at its lowest point, and tops out on a section of the Organ ridge just south of the Little Squaretop Massif summit (or on the summit, if you feel like it). Most of the climbing is quite easy, but we encountered a few 5.7-5.8 sections a bit past midway up the wall. The rock quality is generally good, but the wall sees minimal sunlight and climbing traffic such that large sections of rock are covered in lichen and many of the cracks are filled with dirt and moss. It's unlikely that climbers will repeat the route exactly as we did it, so the pitch descriptions provided here are a basic guide rather than strict lines.    Although Pirates of the Carabiner shares the final few pitches with the historic ""E Face, Bowl Route"", as described in Ingraham's guide (web.nmsu.edu/~amato/ingraha…), the majority of the route in no way matches the Bowl Route description. For example, Ingraham described the start of the Bowl Route as follows ""Traverse off the nose on a narrow ledge into the right side of the Bowl and continue up, generally keeping to its right side, over slabby sections and up short chimneys."" Instead, we scrambled down to the south from the nose, to the lowest point on the main wall, and face/slab-climbed our way up to the ""little glen, hemmed in tightly by vertical walls."" We encountered no chimneys on our route.    P1 (5.4, 180ft): from the lowest point on the wall, pick any of numerous options and run the rope out over easy terrain up the middle of the wall. Protection may be sparse depending on chosen path, but the climbing is easy enough that it shouldn't matter. I placed a single Camalot #3 on the pitch, and built a gear anchor in a crack near a formerly-largish, but now quite dead tree.    P2 (5.4, 180ft): from the dead tree, head up and slightly left over easy ground. Face/slab climb to the right of a small gully, with plentiful but not always obvious pro. Build an anchor when the ropes runs out. We slung a large block near the small gully. From here you could stay left and see if that goes, but instead we traverse slightly right out onto the face just SE of the giant orange/pink roofs (see photos).    P3 (5.6, 120ft): climb up and slightly right on the wide-open face, whose angle continues to increase. Stop when you arrive a suitable gear anchor crack in the middle of the face.     P4 (5.7, 200ft): climb directly upward from the P3 anchor toward what appears to be a spacious ledge up with a large pine tree. Toward the top of the pitch, make some delicate moves up and right toward a small ledge with an anchor-worthy crack about chest level on its right side. This will just work with a 60m rope. Just above the belay is the steepest section of rock yet, but by now it's obvious that just above that section the angle decreases significantly    P5 (5.8 PG13, 120ft): the first 20ft or so of this pitch are the crux of the route. Make delicate moves upward on the lichen-covered rock, with decent feet placements but minimal hands. The only pro I could find was a yellow ball nut placement about 7ft up and slightly left of the P4 belay. From there I traversed up and right until reaching safe ground above, unfortunately still with little to no pro. Continue upward for some 80-100 ft until a good anchor can be found directly below the large pine tree.    P6 (low 5th, 180ft): run the rope out over very easy, low-angle rock until you find yourself in a flat spot just below the Organ ridge, with steep rock all around you. Choose one of many good gear anchors.    P7 (5.6, 100ft): climb up from the flat spot in the righthand/NW corner with plentiful features and pro, until being greeted with for the first time in hours by sunshine (assuming sunny day) on the Organ ridge. Build a gear anchor in a feet level crack.    From atop P7, another pitch would land one on the summit of Little Squaretop Massif. Instead, we scrambled down to the NW and did a single 60m rope rap from a slung boulder. From there we had to crawled under some thick tree branches before emerging in the gully between Little Squaretop and Little Squaretop Massif.","{110312369: 3, 107400530: 2}"

Slung Horn,113908806,Trad,108540309,5.8,1200,6,2.5,2.0,"This route climbs the huge east face of Little Squaretop Massif and then tops out on the summit. To the best of our knowledge, the route connects the first two pitches of the Bowl Route with the last two pitches of Lost Carabiner (these old routes are described in Ingraham's guide web.nmsu.edu/~amato/ingraha…). The only evidence of previous climbing we found was an old bail sling around a short, rounded horn atop P2. This horn was far from confidence inspiring, in terms of the idea of rapping off it. The money pitch of the route is P3, which connects the two old routes.    Follow the approach for Pirates of the Carabiner, but start climbing from the level of the Nose, near a big pine, rather than scrambling down to the bottom of the wall as for Pirates. The first 3 pitches of Slung Horn are on good, fairly clean rock and most of the pitches are ~200ft out of necessity, i.e. because good belay station options are simply that widely spaced. Pitches 4 and 5 are quite dirty and loose, but they still offer some challenging sections as well as a summit bid and plenty of incredible views.    P1 (200ft, 5.6): from the Nose, climb up toward a chimney-like gap (see photo) near the left edge of the rib. To make this work with a 60m rope, scramble up 10-15ft  before you start belaying. Once on a ledge within the chimney, build a gear anchor in the one good crack (small gear) at climber's right.     P2 (200ft, 5.8): Climb out of the chimney on the left side, and then veer right up a long ledge/crack (big gear), with a steep dropoff to the left. Eventually this feature gives way a more gently inclined, slab section with lots of good anchor options. It was at this belay station that we found the scary slung horn.    P3 (200ft, 5.8+): From here, the original Bowl Route would traverse up and left on the gentle slab below the the 5-10ft roof. Instead head up an easy-looking gully to the right, which leads to another long feature, similar to the P2 ledge/crack but slightly steeper. Eventually you can get out of it to the right, where some anchor options are available (small gear).    P4 (180ft, 5.8): Having found yourself in the large gap between roofs to the S and N, bushwack up toward the N roof and then climb the gully below. This pitch is not easy, but it is very, very dirty. You will likely find yourself literally digging through dirt for handholds, using the old knee-in-dirt trick several times, and perhaps even chimneying long sections backwards, i.e. with back to the wall. When you start running out of rope, emerge filthy onto a ledge at left which has good anchor pro.    P5 (200ft, 5.6): if P4 was the dirt pitch, P5 is the loose pitch. Continue up the gully being careful about everything you touch. Eventually emerge onto the ridgeline and hope the Sun is still up. Sling a boulder or build a gear anchor.     P6 (200ft, 4th class): Scramble down from the ridgeline and then bushwack/scamble up a gully to the left which leads to the summit.     For descent, the best option is rapping into the Little Squaretop/Little Squaretop Massif gully, then taking the Organ Needle trail back down to the west. For a more adventurous descent, traverse the ridgeline north toward Squaretop and then down Squaretop gully, where you can eventually rejoin the Tooth trail.","{110312369: 3, 107400530: 2}"

The first pitch is a short scramble from the saddle (5.4) up to a large ledge beneath the steep South ridge which has an obvious slashing crack which ascends the entire ridge up to a large shoulder. The Slash/crack is the crux pitch and currently harbors some nice lichen growths. Despite this, the rock is predominately solid, and there are nice rest-stances between steep sections.

Start up the slab to where a tongue of rock comes down from above. Go up the left side of it. Stay in this left-facing corner for as long as it lasts, then continue in the same direction following cracks. Belay from a minimal ledge.    Pitch 2 ( 5.9, 180 ft): Start by heading left along wrinkles on a slab (run-out). Turn right at a large, wide-open alcove topped by a wall of loose-looking blocks. Avoiding this and instead head gradually right and up to a right-leaning roof. After traversing the roof stay in the corner (maybe 40 ft) until you reach a small ledge, just big enough to stand on. (The corner becomes filled with mud.) Here is where you step right across the face into a crack system. Follow the sharp-angled corner you find yourself in to a nice belay ledge.    Pitch 3 (5.8, 200 ft): Go up a relative shallow-angle, smooth-sided open book to its end. Follow the corner leading left to a step-over onto a slab made of a dike material, heavily featured but smooth in texture. This short section is followed by easier climbing along an arête and past a small tree. The slab which follows is best done on the right, but then head left again where a couple of harder slab moves take you to a roof, which is turned on the left. From there go up a narrow chimney partly filled with blocky rock to the top.     Searching for records of previous ascents, the only route possibly going up to the same shoulder was Ingrahams Impasse Route. The start of it, ""up a narrow 4th class gully to a broad ledge,"" could be interpreted to be the gully to the right of our start. This gully did look to us like the path of least resistance, but we were after some better and cleaner climbing, so we started on the face proper and much lower down. Unfortunately, the only description Ingraham gives for the ""route proper,"" (that is Impasse Route above the fourth class start) is that it goes ""over exposed slabs with small holds and friction climbing to the top of the shoulder."" We tried to stay on the slabby ground, but the right-slanting roof forced us to the right and most of our pitches 2 and 3 was spent navigating the maze of secondary shoulders (with their associated corners) to the right of the slab Impasse Route ascent party was apparently able to use. It could be that where we found loose rock, there was a solid ground decades ago. Or it could be that they were at a different location altogether, as there are other discrepancies as well. After descending from the shoulder, we didn't need to climb a ""3rd class north-south rib"" to reach the notch between Massif and Little Squaretop.",{107400530: 3}

North Face / East Ridge,111778664,Trad,106581274,5.12b,1000,12,3.0,1.0,"This was the first route to ascend the quixotic north face of Minerva’s Temple, Queen of the Organ Mountains, and stands alone as THE visionary hard-man’s route in the Organs. If you are looking for a big serving of adventure with a side of hard work, you will find it here.   Approach: 3 miles, 2500’. Allow 3 hours to hike in and 2.5 to hike out. The gate into Aguirre (Uh-geer-ee) Springs doesn’t open until ~7am, so if you want an alpine start, you’ll need to camp out the night prior.    Park at the group site and head up the Indian Hollow trail towards Sugarloaf. After an hour or so, stay right at the fork with a miniature sign indicating the approach to Sugarloaf goes left. The trail remains easy to follow until it crosses 2 more drainages, then you’ll have to start cairn hunting as it gets consistently steeper, looser, bushier, and harder to follow. Keep your eyes peeled for many artistic cairns, including one in a small tree. If you’ve bushwacked elsewhere in the Organ Mountains, you’ll find this approach quite tame, but if you haven’t, you may find some choice words escaping your mouth on occasion. A very prominent black streak high on the face is directly above the start of the route.    Unless you are hiking in with John Hymer himself, I’d recommend overcoming your Luddite tendencies and downloading the approach/deproach GPX file (link at bottom) into your phone.    Once you’ve located a camouflaged bolt about 15’ off the ground marking the start of the 1st pitch below a long, right-angling ramp system, drop your pack, dump the dirt and rocks out of your shoes and take a well deserved break. If you forgot your headlamp, better make it a short break.  Climb: Although the climb is well protected with many bolts, it feels like adventure climbing at its finest. Crazy lichen abounds on all but the 3rd pitch, and some of the bolts are difficult to find amidst similar-colored lichen. Fortunately, all of the belays are bolted, marking the end of each pitch. Once you are accustomed to climbing on the lichen, you’ll find the movement up this steep route absolutely stellar! If you find yourself fiddling in marginal gear, or placing gear in questionable rock, look around for a bolt.   P1: 5.10, 110’ - The odyssey begins! Clip the first bolt, then move up and right into a small corner. Arrange some gear and mantle (crux) onto the ramp. Follow the ramp past a couple more bolts to a 2-bolt anchor.   P2: 5.11-, 180’ - Continue up the ramp finding gear in the corner and some bolts. As it gets steeper, keep an eye out for hidden bolts on the left face. Work up into a roofy/stemmy/undercling, then bust a move left (crux) and over to a 2-bolt anchor.   P3: 5.11, 110’ - Wander up the wonderfully clean rock past a couple bolts to some difficult moves left. Continue with more sustained moves protected by bolts to the bottom of the black streak and a 2-bolt anchor.   P4: 5.12-, 115’ - Study the shallow chimney-like slot above you and make a plan. Do some 5.10ish moves up and clip the 1st bolt. Likely, abandon your plan here, and thrutch up the slot (crux) praying for grippy lichen underfoot! If Minerva answers your prayers, clip the 2nd bolt and relax; the rest of the pitch is much easier. Head up and left towards the chimney feature finding good gear and a no-hands “Honnolding” rest along the way. A fun mix of climbing behind the chimney eventually trends right to the top of the black streak and a 2-bolt anchor.   P5: 5.11-, 110’ - Now that you’ve done the crux P4, prepare for some adventure! The lichen and route-finding on this pitch may make it feel harder than it really is. Persevere, use your imagination, and enjoy the great movement up the rock. Eventually, you will arrive at a ramp with a bolt in the middle and a clean dihedral on the left. Clip the bolt and head directly left, escaping the dihedral and up to a 2-bolt anchor.   P6: 5.11+, 150’ - Make unprotected moves out an easy slab on the right and locate a line of bolts going up the steep face above. The climbing gets gradually more difficult up to the apex where you’ll encounter a solution underclingy-finger slot. Crank through here (crux) and arrive on Onion Ledge and a 2-bolt anchor. You’ll find some wild onions and nice soft moss to stand barefoot in. An enjoyable place to be!   P7 - P12: Best simul-climbed with the occasional belay as necessary. Follow your nose through some 4th class, sometimes bushy scrambling towards kind of a small saddle. From the saddle, you may be able to look down into a cool treed area high on Minerva’s north flank. From here, traverse left under a boulder (good handjams) and then head up to the start of the Knife Blades. Hand traverse across the unique knife-blade ridge, passing a 2-bolt anchor for the top pitch of SE Face route. Step down to another, duller knife-blade ridge and walk across that to a 2-bolt anchor. A move of 5.7 above the anchor leads to more 3rd/4th class scrambling. When you think you see the summit blocks, go around to the right into a 5.4 dihedral. At the top of this dihedral walk up the final slab to the summit.     Welcome to the very small cult of pain-worshipers that have ascended Minerva’s Temple. Look around for an ammo box, and add your name to the nearly empty summit register.  Descent: Scramble down as far as you dare, before making a series of single-rope rappels, off of whatever features you find handy, finding your way back to Onion Ledge. It may be easier to belay or solo back across the knife blades, otherwise, rappel on their NW side getting back to the saddle. Bring some extra webbing and leaver biners just in case.    From Onion ledge, make 5 double-rope rappels to the ground. The first 3 rappels are from anchors you used on the climb. The last 2 are climber’s left of the route. By now, you’ve probably learned to go slowly as the bolts are sometimes difficult to see, but if you haven’t learned this yet, rap slowly as the bolts are sometimes difficult to see! It may be possible to rap this route with a single 70m rope, but this hasn’t been verified. If you do, please report back here.

Cross the gully to the south and follow cairns up the steep slope heading directly towards the grey rhyolite formation known as ""the Grey Eminence"". the trail meanders along the base of the ""Eminence"" eventually gaining a grassy saddle at its top, commonly referred to as ""Juniper Saddle"", owing to the once proud (now dead) Juniper the cut-down remnants of while still lay around.    From Juniper Saddle, hike directly up the slope until a smooth granite wall blocks passage. This wall is surmounted by scrambling up its right side. Traverse back over to the left.

Approximately 100ft from the saddle is a corner system which can be scrambled up. Near the top of this is a 15 ft section of exposed rock which must be surmounted to reach the summit.

This fine route, the only alternative to the great Vest Face Route in the whole West Face, started out to be a separate line up the West Face staying well to the right of it. However, after five beautiful pitches, it was unable to force the passage upward. Hence the name Great Expectations. As of now, this route can be considered a major variation of West Face, in which 3 beautiful pitches are substituted for the first two pitches of West Face.    Start on the west face of Middle Rabbit Ear at a point where an obvious traverse left over a busy ledge begins. (From the point you normally get onto the West Face to third class up to the first belay spot on West Face, go up along the west face some 200 to 300 feet.)     First Pitch: Traverse left on this busy ledge, dropping down where it becomes difficult, then up to a prominent little perch.     Second Pitch: This is the crux. A steep smooth face above. Go straight up a shallow crack directly above the belay for about 20 feet to the overhang. Then ooze right on minimal footholds with practically no handholds some 15 feet to a reasonable stance. Here you can put your first protection in (#4 stopper). An alternative way to do this pitch is to hand traverse right some 20 feet from the belay spot, then go up to a point just below an overhanging nose which forces you off, then ooze leftward under and around the nose for about 10 feet by good delicate balance technique (first led by Doug Roberts).   From the good stance, take heart  what lies above is easier. Go up and slightly to the right on holds which get progressively better some 25 feet. Get in protection and traverse left about 30 feet on easy rock to the belay stance.     Third Pitch: get as high as possible and mantle onto a good stance to the left. Go up about 30 bare feet on small holds, bearing let. Then a few easy moves lands you on the great concave place of the West Face description. Finish the climb as in West Face.     On the first ascent attempt of Great Expectations, we went one pitch farther, bearing to the right and then a pretty down-sloping traverse. You end up in a comfortable large region on the SW Face. However, above here the angle becomes severe and the protection seems a real problem. ",{107400530: 2}

The descent route drops down directly to the middle of this longe ledge and there are variations that go straight up from the large ledge on various small crack systems and slab climbing.

Awful Buttress,106119571,Trad,106119561,5.8,500,5,1.0,1.0,"This route probably falls under the category of ""Adventure Climbs"". Route-finding for the first few pitches can be difficult, and the straightforward upper pitches involve grunting through chimneys, wrestling off-widths, clawing over bushes, delicately treading over balanced boulders, and some  lichen covered rock. If all this hasn't sunk in yet, there's the name of the buttress itself...    Pitch 1-2, 250ft: Some variations, one of which is climbing 100 ft up a blackened corner to a nice ledge with a small tree. Off to the left of the ledge is a broad sloping ramp. From the ledge, angle up and right following mossy cracks, or traverse right for 50-100 ft and find a weakness in the rock above to gain the ""Bivouac ledge"", a large vegetated ledge. Many of the routes on the NE face start from this ledge and share the first few pitches with this route.    Pitch 3, 60ft: Take the large crack system at the back of the left (North) side of the Bivouac ledge which starts off chimney like up to a small chock-stone, at which point there are some good face holds off to the left which allow escape from the corner. Continue past an awkward bulge to a comfortable ledge off to the left. Build an anchor with small wires using a tiny seam at the back of the ledge.    Pitch 4, 60 ft: Probably the dirtiest pitch. Fight past vegetation over stacked flakes which are jammed into the crack-system. After 30 ft, choose between a squeeze chimney stright-up, or a crack system to the right. The crack on the right is dirty. It also is formed behind a pillar of rock which may not be that well attached to the cliff, although you don't realize this until you get to its top. At which point delicate face moves are required to regain the corner system.    Pitch 5, 120 ft: Crux pitch. Start up the chimney and gain the large chock-stone, then break onto the face on the right and up an off-width crack. A small seam to the right of the off-width offers some additional holds and protection (piton and old 1/4"" bolt). After a rest-stance, the off-width continues up for another 40 ft to the top of the buttress.

Boyer's Chute,106586805,Trad,106119561,5.4,800,5,3.1,20.0,"Boyer's Chute was named after Del Boyer who was the first to free solo the route.     The feature Boyers Chute Route follows starts as a prominent right-facing corner, becomes a distinct chute for most of the way (even turns into a chimney) then opens up again into a right-facing corner.     Pitch 1: Start about 30 feet to the right of the corner on a more featured part of the sloping terrain. The climbing is easy (5.2), but many climbers may want to rope up to avoid exposed slab moves.    Continue into the chute proper and up it. This is generally best done unroped. Easy, even walkable, terrain is interrupted by harder but short steps. Low height above ground and the closed, chimney-like confines of the chute make climbing feel fairly secure. The stretch of more consistent scrambling is also only 4th class if that. The chute will fork eventually the right fork looking far more inviting as the left one is topped by a large chock stone about 20 feet up.  The route goes left!     Pitch 2: There are two options:  (1) scramble past the chock stone on the right without protection (5.3, but exposed and with a somewhat crumbly feel to the large-enough and otherwise solid holds near the top) or (2) climb on the left and protect in a crack (about 5.6 and close to vertical). Above the chock another stretch of scrambling follows until a 20-foot chimney is reached.    Pitch 3: Climb the chimney facing right. Exit is to the left into the broken rocks or climb on the right of them. The second block from the bottom is loose. Belay from two new bolts. This pitch is the crux of the route and may feel harder than the 5.4 rating.    Pitch 4: Start all the way left, deep in the corner. Move right on nearly vertical but well featured rock. The path of least resistance will slide a bit to the right, traverse left under the large agave, and continue the rightward slant to a level area with some trees. This pitch is often done unroped by experienced climbers and other variations of it exist as the terrain is generally forgiving.

Go up Boyer's Chute to a dihedral-crack system on the left wall of the chute which seems to lie back a little toward the top. The first pitch goes up 40-50' to the top of a sloping ledge on the right part of the dihedral. (It's best to belay here because of rope drag on the next pitch.)     Next, cross the dihedral and take to a vertical bit on its left wall with just the necessary holds. About 30 feet up, go right into the dihedral and belay from a nice little standing ledge about 50' above the belayer.     On the last pitch, climb the right side of the dihedral, using good footholds on the left side at a crucial point. Climb left and join the Miracle Route about 50' above the belay.

The Davis Route,107146143,Trad,106119561,5.5,800,4,2.3,6.0,"This historic route was used by Harry and Betty Davis for the first ascent of the North Rabbit Ear. It is more technical, steeper, and cleaner than Boyer's Chute, without the slog through loose dirt. A nice beginner route to the summit of the NRE, it protects well and provides great views.    Pitch 1, 160 ft, offers the steepest sections of rock. The primary difficulties are surmounting awkward blocks. You may want to split this pitch to reduce rope drag, as the top-out is more technical than the rest. There are two rap stations on this pitch, one about half way up, the other (less obvious) all the way at the top where steep rock gives way to a scramble over a bouldery shoulder with some mountain mahogany. Scramble around until you are on a more westerly facing rock and see an obvious tree-filled gully leading up to the what appears to be the summit.     Pitch 2, 140 ft. This gully offers several challenges of its own, and numerous variations. There are some clean slabs and cracks on either side which could make for a much harder route. On some of these cracks, old pitons will be found.    An alternative to the ""brush filled gully"" after ""the shoulder"" is to head to the left of the gully (after the initial moves, which are best done on the right side). After couple of large steep steps, there is a tree on the left with a bit of a head-wall above it. The head-wall is easily surmounted on the left. Belay from here and then go up the ridge line past another large tree, up the slab beyond it, and on to the false summit nearby, then scramble to the real summit farther north.    For a rappel down, walk south from the summit. There are cairns marking the descent route. At this point the location of descend looks extremely unlikely, as the boulders seem to lead to a sheer drop, but you get to a small shoulder below with a ramp leading to the right from it. Follow the ramp, easy 3rd class, to a bolt+piton rap anchors. Rap about 100 feet over an overhang to a broad shelf. The second rappel, protected by two bolts, requires two ropes and reaches the saddle between North and Middle Rabbit Ears only a short distance above the start of Davis Route.

P1 (25m): Starts with some moderate climbing in the steep vegetated corner up to a crux in an off-width, flaring chimney corner.

P2 (15m): Relatively easy climbing to a good belay ledge about 10m beneath the overhanging roof. This pitch could be linked with P1, but potentially with some rope drag.  P3 (10m): climb up the left corner and below the overhanging roof, then traverse right about 5ft to where it becomes feasible to pull up over the roof onto a ledge. The more reach you have, the easier this will be, as there is a reachy jug that helps you muscle over the roof. A #2/yellow Camalot protects the move nicely. Belay from the small ledge above the roof to make sure you have good communication with your follower as they climb the pitch. This ledge becomes quite crowded with 3 people.  P4 (40m): Another awkward, flaring off-width crux (like the one on P1) is encountered immediately upon leaving the belay station. A #0.5/purple Camalot protects this move. After that the climbing eases up for a while until a final crux is encountered, involving an unsure slab move to the left out of a crack system (small cams & balls nuts useful). Belay from a brushy ledge above this.  P5 (40m): Numerous 5.7 or easier options exist for proceeding to the summit, but there's not really a straight line path, such that rope drag adds up with the frequent meandering.

(Not at all if the left/corner version of Bucky Blue is considered.)  Finding the start: From the bottom of Bucky Blue traverse right, but stop short of the next large corner. Bucky's Right Shoulder goes to and past the right end of the prominent roof.  Pitch 1 goes straight up a slab to a band of more featured ground surrounding a vertical seam/crack with a couple of small trees growing in its higher section. A single bolt visible to the left of the band. (You can clip it or not. It's a bit to the left of the route and belongs to Barb's Roof.) Head straight up just right of the roof to a ledge. (I placed my anchor bit to the left here.)  Pitch 2: Continue up the next slab along the same feature. Protection is less here, but the climbing is easy. Once past the next ledge (and the vegetation on it), go up what continues to be a band of featured rock, now much narrower but with some protection possibilities still available, to an easy slab. You are now on the ""tree"" version of Bucky and can take the crack system to the large tree.  Pitch 3 (direct version): From the tree go up and right on walkable terrain to the next right-facing corner, then climb up the corner. Protect and start traversing along good crack well short of the large roof above you. The crack will end at about the level of the end of the roof. Step up and belay from the ledge next to the end of the roof. The pitch is short but making it longer results in significant rope drag.  Pitch 3 (head-wall version): Walk from the tree right along wide vegetated ledges to an area below a headwall (see image). Start up along the sickle-shaped crack left of the ridgeline. It goes up vertically at first over a featured, blocky-almost terrain up the distinct bulge (this is the steepest part of the route and the crux). After about 20 feet, it turns left and leads to a ledge. Traverse left on the ledge to a bottom of a right-facing corner. (This is the end of the direct version of Pitch 3, but starting from here you do not need to belay from this location, you can combine pitches 3 and 4.)  Pitch 4 (easy version): Go up part of the corner then head left over the boulders to the left of it and continue up and left over a slab with cracks, ideally above the little bush and the cholla encountered along the way. Continue left to the top of Bucky Blue.  Pitch 4 (cleaner version): Go up the corner all the way to the ridgeline then transition to the south side for a short traverse to the top of Bucky Blue. The pitch may be split at the ridgeline if that is considered desirable. The traverse is not protectable, but it is very short and protection is available above the level of the traverse on both ends.

Dick's Delight,114213614,Trad,106154664,5.8+,1000,7,3.5,2.0,"This route is included in the Leland Davis East Slabs guide as the ""Standard Route (Dick's Delight)"". If you enjoy long pitches of mostly or completely unprotectable slab climbing on an ocean of immaculate granite, you will also find this route to be a delight. The climb shares pitches 1-3 with the Normal Route, and pitches 5-7 with the Great Bowl/Ingraham Dihedral route. Pitch 4 is a zero-pro slab traverse to connect the two routes. Avoid the route if you hate constantly being >3-4 body lengths above or right of your last piece of gear.   P1 (5.7R, 120ft): Start up slab toward the right-facing corner, placing some gear in it before veering left out onto the slab proper. Once on the slab, look directly above for a good bolt, ignoring the old 1/4"" to the left. After clipping the good bolt, climb upward toward left-facing flake features. Build a gear anchor in the left flake.   P2 (5.6R, 200ft): Climb up over mostly unprotected slab, taking advantage of any available pro opportunities. Rather than taking to the brushy ledge developing above and right, stay on the slab and go for a cobblestone road-like section. This part is really fun climbing (no pro). End up with a gear anchor in left-facing flake about 10-15ft left of the brushy ledge.   P3 (5.6R, 180ft): Continue up the flake/corner feature in which you built the anchor, then either climb steeper slab directly up or veer slightly right and then back left. At this point you know to take advantage of any/all available gear placements, of which there are a few on this pitch. Build a gear anchor in a right-facing corner/flake system, on a comfy brushy ledge (the ""lunch ledge"").   P4 (5.6R, 120ft): The Normal Route would head upward from here. Instead traverse directly right to the base of Ingraham's Dihedral. No gear is available on this pitch. It starts with some delicate 5.6, but after a while you can literally walk on a surface made of water eroded dimples. Build a gear anchor in the right-facing flakes below the dihedral, utilizing an old fixed piton.   P5 (5.7+R, 200ft): Climb the Ingraham Dihedral, taking advantage of a few small gear placements in the lower half of it. Once it starts getting steeper and you start getting more scared about how far above your last gear you are, traverse left delicately, place a cam or two in a flake feature, and climb the rest of the dihedral on it's left side. End at a relatively new 2-bolt anchor below the roof above.   P6 (5.8+R, 180ft): This is the serious pitch. From the 2-bolt anchor, traverse right of the roof and up, eventually reaching a point where you can step up above the roof onto the next, steeper level. A terrible 1/4"" bolt is right in front of you, and clip it you must (no other pro). Climb directly up on steeper, less-featured slab, seeking out any possible ledges along the way. Once standing on one of these, you can reach down and try to place a nut. Eventually reach a better ledge and finally get in a good piece of gear (0.3 Camalot). Next, do a fingertip undercling traverse on the overlap feature that trends up and left, maybe placing a blue ball nut under it if you can find the right spot. I found exactly one such spot, giving me the courage to step up onto the next level and climb more steep slab to a small but anchor-worthy tree.   P7 (5.4, not R!, 100ft): Climb up a good crack and then veer right to non-technical ground. Place cams in the crack just for fun, since you brought them.

Great Bowl/Ball Nut Courage,114283028,Trad,106154664,5.8,800,5,2.0,2.0,"This route utilizes the first 1.5 pitches of the normal Great Bowl route, before diverging to the right over a steep slab crux that places you on a trajectory toward a topout at a large Pinon Pine with a full pitch of low-angle, uncracked, granite below it.   P1 (45m, 5.6):  After a bunch of scrambling to get below it, climb a wide, laybackish feature near the right edge of the Great Bowl. This could be sewed up with some #5s, but a #4 among smaller are accepted at various points. Eventually, veer left on a walkable ramp toward a belay station with two old pitons that can be backed up.   P2 (~60m, 5.8R):  Climb up to the center of the roof above, clipping a high left piton, and then grabbing the scary-looking but solid flake feature and mantling up the roof. Beyond the roof 20-30ft, the route diverges from the Great Bowl route, heading right up steep slab instead of left toward the Ingraham Dihedral. The crux of this would be easier for a tall person who could reach up and grab a critical chickenhead to surpass some steep slab. I placed blue and yellow ball nuts (bomber) in the thin crack just below this to work up the courage. Work right after this toward a large flake/crack system where an anchor can be built.   P3 (15m, 5.5):  Climb up to a comfy ledge with a tree that can be slung for an anchor.   P4 (45m, 5.5):  Identify a large pinion pine above and slightly left, and head for for it. Build an anchor in a left-facing crack below a featureless slab above.   P5 (55m, 5.5R):  Ascend the blank slab below the large pine. I placed a single token nut about 3/4 of the way up the slab, where there is a small ledge.  Scramble from the large Pinon Pine upward and right, then join the normal walkoff back to Bivy Boulder.","{110312369: 2, 107400530: 2}"
The Great Bowl/Ingraham Dihedral,106368440,Trad,106154664,5.8,900,5,3.0,5.0,"An excellent and obvious line on the massive sloping slabs. While the route is predominately slab climbing, some nice features like an exposed move to exit the Great Arch, and the beautiful Ingraham Dihedral makes the route memorable. The original Great Bowl route can be done at 5.6 and avoids the Ingraham Dihedral and the few difficult sections above.  Pitch 1: Starting slightly more to the right side of the Great Arch, follow a corner system for nearly a rope-length. Belay at a sloping ledge with two pitons, about 30 ft below a weakness in the great arch. 5.5 160 ft. Variations to the left up the blank looking slab can be led and offer slightly more challenging 5.6 pg-13 climbing.  Pitch 2: Climb directly up to the weakness in the great arch. Much of the rock under the overlap is dirty and lichen covered, but you won't be stepping on that stuff. A piton marks the spot where you can easily surmount the head-wall. The move is airy, but not as hard as it looks, and can be well protected. Above the overlap, continue of the corner system passing another piton. The corner system begins curving sharply to climber's left and eventually becomes a headwall. 5.6 180 ft. Variation: Instead of curving left, continue almost directly straight up the face following a faint left-facing corner (piton). You can then either re-join the main route by making a traversing pitch, or continue up straight up on discontinuous crack systems at around 5.5  Pitch 3: Nearly a full rope length of travel over a heavily featured slab that gets less steep as you go. Protection is sparse, but the climbing is comfortable at 5.5 or easier. A prominent dihedral becomes visible straight ahead, the Ingraham Dihedral. A beautiful belay is made under the dihedral, where the rock appears to make a flat-cobblestone road. This geologic oddity is reason enough to climb the route, as it looks like hundreds of flat pave-stones were carefully embedded into the slab. 170' 5.5.  Pitch 4: To keep the climbs 5.6 rating, meander off to the right to avoid the Ingraham Dihedral. Another easier variation is to strike off left over-slabs and join up with Normal Route. Arguably the best choice is to climb the Dihedral, a thinly protected 5.8 corner. Finish at a two-bolt belay underneath a small roof.  Pitch 5: From the belay at the top of Ingraham's Dihedral one can either exit left or right. Exiting left around a triangular roof leads to 5.8+ moves before the climbing eases and the protection becomes scarce. A long unprotectable 5.7R section of slab must be passed before a flake is gained which leads to the tree-line. Exiting right is 5.7+ and protect by a 1/4"" bolt.","{105810673: 3, 107393096: 3, 107523813: 3, 12435: 3, 106568675: 3}"
The Jewel,117024419,Trad,106154664,5.7+,1000,7,4.0,4.0,"The Jewel was included on the old Southwestern Mountaineers (SWM) topo mountainproject.com/photo/1… as the longest route at the East Slabs (8 pitches), and one of few East Slabs routes to follow crack/corner systems rather than blank R-rated slab. The three out of four stars it earned from the SWM is high praise considering the other SWM topos, in which number of stars usually correlates with difficulty. For a moderate route (5.7+), this was clearly a favorite among those who climbed it. The route is named after a large vein of crystals behind a tree exactly 60m off the ground.  As we discovered in the first repeat of the route in possibly ~40 years (?), the Jewel is indeed excellent despite requiring a massive effort and intimate familiarity with the area in order to efficiently approach, climb, and descend in a single day push. The approach is long, the bushwacking is occasionally severe (on and off route), and the descent involves a sketchy rappel followed by downclimbing many hundred feet of sometimes treacherous 3rd/4th class. The reward is a fun, long route featuring a diverse range of climbing on mostly immaculate granite studded with chicken heads and enough cracks to make it only barely R-rated. For me, the crux was following the downclimb pitch.  We followed the topo, breaking pitches up accordingly, only linking 1 and 2. What follows is the recommended pitch breakup for a team solid at the grade.  P1 (5.8, 30m): Climb the obvious, left-facing, intermittently-vegetated corner to the first of two trees.  P2 (5.8, 45m): Continue up the acute corner from the second tree, surmounting a small roof. This leads to a small ledge which leads into a left-facing flake. Build belay on finger sized gear and the best stance.  P3 (5.8R, 50m): Climb the flake as it becomes more hollow, taking care to set good gear before moving right and then up the knobby slab to a good stance and two rusted ¼ inch bolts. Clip both of them and make a few thin slabs moves up to a better ledge. Traverse leftward to a shallow, flaring, pocketed crack that leads to various belay options (shrubs, stoppers in flakes, and/or wedged blocks).  P4 (5.8, 55m): Follow the broken corner past a yucca crux and other bushes to the roof, where perfect handjams lead right to a right facing corner. Climb this corner up the widening crack. This leads to a terrace on the left with a couple good ledges for belay.  P5 (5.6, 30m): Climb to the large ponderosa pines above (1 alive, 1 dead) via one of several marginally-protectable alternatives, one of which entails 30 feet of blank 5.6 slab. Belay from one of the pine trees (we used the dead one).  P6 (5.7, 30m): From the dead pine tree, traverse up and right through some oak to a down and rightward weakness. Downclimb the ramp, then make a couple face moves down into the vegetated gully below. Make sure to place a lot of pro to ease the anxiety of your followers who will all of a sudden find themselves on lead.  P7 (5.7, 55m): From the large pine tree in the gully, climb the clean right-facing corner (#3-#5 cams), following it as it goes out of sight of the belayer left and upward. One will encounter rap tat upon arriving at the end of the route. A far less protectable alternative to the wide crack is the 5.6 slab to the right (as shown in the old SWM topo). The first pro would be about 30-40 feet off the ground if taking the slab alternative.","{110312369: 4, 200163370: 4, 106994427: 4, 105810673: 4}"
La Mancha,106368487,Trad,106154664,5.7,900,6,1.0,2.0,"This route will either freak you out, or make you you wish you were soloing. Two of the pitches offer no protection between the belays, and the others don't offer much more. On the plus side, you cover some beautiful, pure and mostly un-spoiled granite.  The first pitch starts off straight-forwardly enough, a short slab gains a brushy ledge with a left facing crack on its right-hand side. You can climb the crack or stick to the highly featured face for about 100ft, but then the crack peters out and the slab gets slabbier. Put in your last bit of protection where the crack peters out.

Misty,106174450,Trad,106154664,5.8,800,5,2.7,3.0,"The first half of this route is wide open slabs. Landmarks are few and far between, and it is apparent that the first ascentionists drilled the few bolts on lead, mainly because there aren't very many. For the first 300 ft, there are two drilled belays, and only one bolt in between each. As for other protection, you may find a creative placement behind a shallow sounding flake, but don't expect much. The upper portion has a pitch of beautiful cracks, which finally let you use some of your gear, before the final 1-2 pitches of mostly unprotectable slab climbing.    P1: Start about 50 ft below a small overlap, where a single bolt is clearly visible. By starting in from the left, you can place a supplemental piece or two before reaching the overlap. From the overlap, climb directly up over 5.7 slabs without protection to a two-bolt anchor, ~80ft. If 80 ft without protection isn't you idea of a good time, trend right a bit past the overlap where a few small pieces can be placed in a shallow right-facing corner.    P2: Climb straight up the open slab, ~5.7. Pass by two dike-protrusions that angle up and left, at the second one, clip the one bolt of the pitch (~80ft). Another 50 ft gains a two-bolt belay. A more protecable variation trends right where some more shallow right facing corners offer up some tiny placements. If you take the variation, you end up reaching the second pitch belay of Bearwalk, a comfortable scooped out ledge.    P3: Continue 180 ft of 5.6 climbing passing a few shallow left facing corners that surprisingly do not offer much protection. Belay at a nice stance under a large flake.    P4: Climb around the left side of the flake and then run out for 50 ft over a smooth slab, 5.7, until you gain a small crack system underneath a large headwall. After a few small brush, there are two beautiful splitter cracks which lead to weaknesses in the headwall. The right hand weakness goes at 5.8. The left hand weakness is a pretty dihedral, with finger-tip lay-backs, and feels more like 5.9. Finish at a small pine tree growing out of a large crack.

It makes use of several large features of the slab which vary the climbing up a bit, but mostly it is wide-open slab climbing. It was first done in 7 pitches but can be done in less than that using modern ropes. The key is to pay  attention to where your next belay stance will be, as you will not find much protection while in the oceanic slab.    The first pitch starts up a short crack at the extreme left (South) side of the great Bowl. At the top of the crack, exit left onto the knobby slab and look for a lone 1/4"" bolt nearby. This is the only  piece of fixed gear currently on the route. Continue past the bolt up a black streak to a nice stance behind on a flake.

Pitch 3-4: Walk up an extremely pocked low-angle slab and then make directly for the bottom of a right facing corner (Ingraham's Dihedral is about 60 ft to the right and can be accessed at this point). The right facing corner is the most protectable feature you'll get on this climb and goes at 5.6.

Left Eyebrow,106767277,Trad,105809130,5.7,0,9,3.3,25.0,"Overview and Opinion:  Having climbed several Sugarloaf routes, including the classic North Face, I found this one to be my favorite so far.  Now here's the catch: I am not 100% sure what I have described below is the original route or a variation (if anyone reviews this write-up and can set the record straight, I would appreciate knowing if this is the correct way).  The old topos, guides, etc. are somewhat hard to follow.  Either way, the route we climbed is great and has many classic pitches and some thrilling runouts on mostly solid Tuolumne-style granite.  The 250 ft hands-to-fists crack on the second and first half of the third pitch is excellent.  The sixth pitch is probably harder than 5.6 (I will go out on a limb and say 5.7) and should not be taken lightly due to there being only two options for pro after turning the roof (one of which is a manky, rusty 1/4 in bolt that doesn't seem like it would hold a hard fall).  Because of this pitch, I think an 'R' is due.  Despite the moderate 5.7 rating, this pitch is not for beginner leaders; most of the rest of the route protects well.    The route has a fair bit of traversing, making the route length longer than the formation is tall.  Overall, this climb makes for a great adventure and should be on everyone's short list.","{105853720: 4, 111779405: 4, 105827495: 4, 107577097: 4, 107771964: 4, 112024720: 4, 107591659: 4, 109606302: 4, 107682622: 4, 106168456: 4, 107393096: 4, 107622323: 4, 106990820: 3, 110312369: 3, 105794406: 3, 107400530: 3, 105810673: 3, 107256360: 3, 107523813: 3, 109856891: 3, 111842799: 3, 106958645: 3, 200088662: 3, 109527587: 2, 107782382: 0}"

I've posted this as 5.6 to be consistent with the included portions of Left Eyebrow and North Face.  I suspect most will feel like it is 5.7.    Disclaimer: Rather than including this as a Sugarloaf 'route', my personal preference would be to simply indicate on the route Left Eyebrow where and how to transition to North Face.  However, the powers that be preferred I use the 'route' feature of MP to describe this transition.    P1 & P2:  Climbed as per Left Eyebrow, ending at a gear belay once you run out of rope on the excellent, continuous hands-to-fist crack.    P3:  Continue up the remaining crack but step onto the right face before the bush (i.e., ""small, left-leaning spruce tree"" per North Face).  Head up past an over-large chicken head for a total of ~35m to a nice ledge and belay. This ledge takes a couple large hexes for a belay anchor and is essentially a large notch in the bottom of a right-facing dihedral that continues up.  See note below.    P4: Essentially, you are already on North Face.  And you have a choice:    a) continue ~straight up (maybe slightly left) on easy run-out terrain to the bivouac ledge bolts;   b) or step right out of the large notch and then climb up a right-facing corner. Eventually step right onto a smaller right-facing corner or irregular flake (initially detached) until can take an easy ~20 foot traverse left to the bivouac ledge bolts.    At the bivouac ledge bolts, I prefer to clip one and continue up.  But rope drag could become an issue if you came up via 'P4b' above and short-sling'd a bolt.    P5 thru P8:  Summit via the remainder of North Face.    Note: The below image by Johnny Gann is taken at or very near the above end-of-pitch-3 large notch.

North Face,105834678,Trad,105809130,5.6,1800,9,3.8,66.0,"The impressive and long North face of Sugarloaf attracts climbers like no other formation in the Organs. This route makes the most of the long continuous North face, climbing anywhere from 9 to 11 pitches to reach the summit. Trying to describe each pitch in details is not really in the spirit of the climb, as there are as many variations as pitches. At the same time, getting off-route on these hard-to-protect slabs can spell some bad situations. After much soul searching, I decided to include a detailed description, but if you are into adventure climbing, there is an ocean of granite for you to explore.  P1: Start from the base of the north slab apron, the base of the shallow sickle-shaped left-facing corner seen in one of the photos is my favorite spot. If you start lower, you may be forced to simul-climb since your rope won't reach. A really easy pitch takes you past one tree and up to the highest pine tree on this slab, a vigorous pine tree somewhat to the left of the other trees below.  P2: Follow the edge of a flake to the small, protectable roof and step over it on the right. Head up chicken heads. Slightly to the right you reach couple of cracks with some museum style fixed gear in one of them. Above you'll find a vegetated ramp leading left to a pair of bolts. Belay here if you have a 60m rope. With a 70m you can keep going up more chicken heads with some opportunity for pro to another pair of bolts just below a bulge.  P3: Follows a left trending seam with sporadic placements to a shallow bush-filled groove with another anchor above its top.  P4: Follows an obvious groove angling right. Walk along it as it turns into a ledge. Look for two solid pitons where it turns back up. You may place one more nut before the run-out. Past the sea of chicken heads, you will see a left-facing corner high on the right. Just past the top of that corner is your anchor. Locate the less steep traverse about half way up to it and plot your way through the field of chicken heads. Once in the corner, keep in mind that rock is slicker where water runs over it.  P5: Head directly toward the bottom of the left facing corner on the right over more run-out chicken heads. A solitary bolt on top of the lip few feet up the corner is your only protection. Take to the featured terrain on the right for steep twenty feet before angling right to reach a crack. From here it's easy and protectable all the way to the small, left-leaning spruce tree.  P6: More run-out chicken heads straight up, but the going is super easy. (Alternatively you can go to the right and up a bottom of a right-facing corner making this into a protectable pitch with quite a bit of rope drag.) Clip the Bivy Ledge bolts and continue up a five-foot-wide dike (more like a band of different colored rock which runs up the slabs). Follow this rock band, or go up the broken terrain left of it. Above a small ledge angle build a gear anchor in a left facing corner. (The reason for not using the Bivy Ledge bolts is to reduce rope drag for Pitch 7.)  P7: Continue up along the dike. The holds will get smaller and the angle steeper. (It will stay this steep for the remaining pitches.) Fortunately there are at least some placements. The old piton with a ring on it (which should be replaced with a bolt) is best tied below the ring. The pitch is short and ends where the dike starts petering out. The bolts are easy to find.  P8: The blocky, protectable terrain soon gives way to a field of chicken heads, many of them on a scary-thin flake which covers all of the rock for a time. Keep aiming for a left-sloping break in the roof above. The bolts at the top of the pitch may be difficult to see as there is a bit of a bulge below them. The area immediately around the bolts is fairly smooth, so keep rope drag to a minimum.  P9: Take the right facing corner above the bolts, then climb over it to the left. Look for a head-size, mushroom-shaped chicken head, sling it and climb it. A featured but steep terrain will take you left to a large right-facing structure - a corner with a nose sticking out of it. Protect at the base of this and go up alongside. Follow cracks to the summit. A right-facing corner provides one belay option (no more bolts here).","{107523813: 4, 111277689: 4, 107841551: 4, 11029: 4, 107464370: 4, 108033588: 4, 108167646: 4, 107682622: 4, 105801687: 4, 108336698: 4, 107575003: 4, 106168456: 4, 106846921: 4, 110312369: 4, 107577097: 4, 200384377: 4, 200463220: 4, 106006987: 4, 109498998: 4, 110237587: 4, 110263304: 4, 108364046: 4, 109000066: 4, 200060685: 4, 106228321: 4, 107771964: 4, 108670961: 4, 107320693: 4, 106174050: 4, 106568675: 4, 10121: 4, 106087285: 4, 107695974: 4, 106185070: 4, 106775085: 4, 105810673: 4, 11344: 4, 105827495: 4, 107793400: 4, 107622323: 4, 107393096: 4, 12435: 4, 11926: 4, 105913149: 4, 105973110: 4, 106081147: 4, 11878: 4, 106120465: 4, 107053586: 4, 106694734: 4, 105853720: 4, 106097978: 4, 107827772: 3, 106325770: 3, 106536932: 3, 106705428: 3, 200132139: 3, 106314584: 3, 106052225: 3, 7114042: 3, 107710725: 3, 112453368: 3, 111361513: 3, 110740325: 3, 107782382: 3, 112065339: 3}"
Old North Face,108537793,Trad,105809130,5.6,0,9,2.5,4.0,"It has been customary to include any route on the north face of Sugarloaf under the heading of North Face and to cover some considerable discrepancies with a disclaimer about infinite variations. But in reality from about a third of the way up there are two routes in general use, one on the right with its shiny gear at each belay, and the other on the left with tattered slings on windblown trees and rusty pitons. The two routes come to within 50 feet of each other at the Bivy Ledge, and the ledge can be used to connect them, but above that they are far apart.    The Old North Face (which for the top half of the climb is on an easier, if admittedly dirtier, terrain) is not only of historical interest, or just another alternative. Starting from the Bivy Ledge it becomes the preferred way to reach the summit when strong westerly winds (for which Sugarloaf is infamous) make runout slabs elsewhere untenable. And it makes a good soloing route.    The Old North Face had 13 pitches, back when. The description that follows is intended for a modern use, but even at the beginning where it follows the route of North Face, it gives an alternative layout of some of the belays.    Pitch 1: (same as North Face) go up and slightly left past one tree with a sling high up on it, to the highest large tree, again with a sling.    Pitch 2: (same as North Face, but shorter) go straight up over the small and easy roof. Check out the rigid-stem Friend used as a part of a fixed gear anchor (and place your own gear). Stop at the first set of bolts.     Pitch 3: (still on North Face route, or not) go up past a pair of bolts found just below the right end of the overlap above. If staying on North Face route, go left along a smoothish ramp below the overlap and then up the draw to a small tree. A challenging variation takes off from the bolts up and slightly to the right under the small overhang, then continues up the black streak. It re-joins the North Face just below the its Pitch 4 belay which it shares. It has been climbed in the past, as attested to by old bolts, but it is run out and not recommended.    Pitch 4: (if done as for North Face) go up the groove, past bolts, and follow an easy ramp heading right to a pair of pitons.    Pitch 5: finish the last of the ramp, then cross a field of chicken heads to a left facing corner. The bolts to the right of the top of the corner are the North Face Pitch 4 belay. Clip one of the bolts that are couple of feet to the right of the top of the corner with a long sling and turn to traverse left and up to the base of the huge right-facing dihedral and belay. This is the crux, and a heady, runout lead. Some belay at a low ledge with a huge homemade piton. I prefer to set a belay anchor up at the base of the dihedral itself.      Pitch 6: Lead up the right-facing dihedral. Mostly climb out on the face to the right, moving left occasionally to place gear. At the dihedral's break to the right, escape left and then up to a horizontal ledge/crack. Belay here. You may need to simul depending on where the starting belay is set and on whether you have a 60 or 70 meter rope. (It is possible to do above P5/P6 in three pitches without any simul-climbing with a 60 meter rope by finishing P5 at the bolts then leading to the huge right-facing dihedral and belaying where the dihedral breaks right (a semi-hanging belay on gear  :-/). From there you escape left and stop at a gear anchor at Bivy Ledge level.    Pitch 7: If joining the route here from North Face, walk left from Bivy Ledge bolts to the right-facing corner, the left side of which is now made of stacked flakes. Go up the corner to a gully. Continue up the left side of the gully to the windblown tree with slings on it.    Pitch 8: Continue up the gully which will turn into a narrowing ramp with some exposure to the left. You can continue up the ramp and then go right up another, even dirtier, gully, but the rope drag is significant. Instead go up to the right past small overlaps on an easy and protectable ground. You can set up a belay in the boulders above, but that will mean either two pitches to the top or some easy simul-climbing. A longer pitch to a crack in the slope above will avoid that.    Pitch 9: Head toward the roof below the summit. Take the groove leading to the left of it. The moves involved in turning the roof are easy enough and protectable. It is possible to go around the roof on the right instead, with more exposure and a short (protectable) hand traverse which leads to a right facing corner.","{107160876: 3, 110312369: 3, 107400530: 2, 108670961: 2}"
Science Friction (to Left Eyebrow),106105358,Trad,105809130,5.10d,800,9,3.7,12.0,"Described as a highly recommended Organ classic, this climb is a great way to reach the Sugarloaf summit, for a party that's up for climbing 5.10 slabs. Don't be discouraged by the 5.11 rating, the crux section is short, right at a bolt which you could easily aid off of to get through, or avoided altogether by poorly protected 5.9 friction traverse.  4/2018: Most of the original 1/4"" bolts have been replaced with modern 3/8"" bolts, and all of the hanging belays have at least one new bolt.  Pitch 1. Go up right leaning cracks to the second of 2 fixed pins. Traverse left on the face to a new bolt, then continue left on less-featured slab to a second bolt. Up from here to a 3-bolt belay on a small ledge. (5.10)  Pitch 2. Move right on the ledge, then up to a fixed pin in a dish. Up and a little right past two bolts with the climbing consisting of thin face/slab moves between ledges big enough to rest on. Stop at an anchor with 3 bolts. (5.10-). You could rappel to the ground from here with 2 ropes, but expect to leave webbing at the belay if doing so.  Pitch 3. 10' up and left is a bolt. You can climb directly past this with a 5.11 boulder problem to a small undercling flake (recommended) or avoid the 5.11 section by traversing left from the belay and going up from there (5.9? big fall possible?). ""A0"" using the bolt is a reasonable option to avoid the short 5.11 section. After the crux, angle left to a fixed piton, and then, an amazing flake that you'll hand traverse back to the right. Continue up to a belay on a good ledge with some fixed pins and lots of tat. (5.11 or 5.10A0 or 5.9R?). You could retreat from here to the top of p2 with 2 ropes, if necessary.  Pitch 4. Your goal is to reach the big tree shared with Left Eyebrow. The topos show to head left on a fun, but unprotected, chickenhead face to a wiggly 'fixed' piton (which can be backed up with small cam). From this point, cruise up low angle knobby slab with minimal pro to a hollow flake and the tree. Written word in RC:NM says you can get to this tree by ""face climbing right, then up the the tree"" from the previous belay as well. Check out the giant steel ring on the webbing on the tree! (5.8). You could retreat from here to the top of p3 with 2 ropes.   From this tree, the climb follows the upper pitches of Left Eyebrow.  It has some runout sections, but that probably won't bother you as its significantly easier than Science Friction.  Pitch 5. Angle right on easy ledges to below a bunch of left facing flakes that form a left facing corner. Some choss. (5.2)  Pitch 6. Follow the corner/crack system, to a dead tree stump (belay here, or continue farther right to a stance in the corner below the obvious roof) (5.4). These last two pitches can be combined with a modest amount of simulclimbing.  Pitch 7. Climb up to the roof, escape its to its right- to an amazing face of knobs and chickenheads. Continuing up, bear a little to the right, passing a bolt, to reach a 3-bolt belay (rated ""5.6"", probably more like 5.7 R).  Pitch 8-9. Follow a right-leaning crack to a bolt, then traverse left to bust through a roof on big jugs. Soon above this, you'll reach a right-facing corner. Belay somewhere in here.  With a 70m rope we were able to continue to a grassy ledge in a single long pitch, but you'll need to split this into 2 pitches with a shorter rope. Quality. (""5.6"", maybe 5.7?).  Pitch 10.

A bouldery start with sidepull holds and small crimps gets you to a   stance above the small bulge 8' up- this is a fun boulder problem in of itself.  Thin crimp move past the small roof and you can grab a larger flat-topped ledge.  Manteling onto this ledge is tricky, then a weird move to more crimps, lets you reach the thinnest and cruxiest section of the climb; bear down on tiny edges or find some trickery for 2 or 3 moves on the slightly overhanging face. Better edges & ledges are above, and the hard part of the climbing is done after 30' up.    Obviously the ""Flying A crack"" is considered ""off"" throughout the climb but for the most part moving over to it is not too tempting, so it's not unreasonably contrived.

Cat Burglar,106274181,Trad,105992186,5.7,2000,14,3.2,5.0,"This is a ~2000' climb just to the left of the ""Great Couloir,"" a prominent cleft running the whole height of the cliffs just to the left of the highest part of the Brazos Cliffs (see photo at right).  I will try to describe the roped pitches here, but please also look at the attached photos and their captions. In particular, take a look at the attached hand-drawn topo by Norbert Ensslin (a senior member of the Los Alamos Mountaineers).  Approach the base of the Great Couloir. There are two possible starts to the route: (a) ""direct start"" to the left of the Great Couloir and (b) the Great Couloir start. We did the latter.  Direct start:  p1: climb up a buttress with featured rock (to the left of the Great Couloir) up to a tree on the skyline (see photo)  p2: continue up clean rock to another large tree at a good ledge (see photo)  Continue with p4 below.  Great Couloir start:  p1: climb the start of the Great Couloir almost a full rope length; snow/ice probable near the very bottom early season (see photo)  p2: continue up solid rock with some vegetation (see photo); a 60 m rope here would have allowed us to reach a better belay spot.  p3: traverse left a bit and continue up solid rock to the big tree at the top of p2 of the direct start (see photo)  p4: from the tree, head slightly right then up crack system; go up to the right of a roof then back left onto the top of the roof; belay on a small ledge or from inside a small cutout about 10 feet above the ledge. This pitch is sustained 5.7 and exciting.  p5: continue up a crack system and pass by the left side of the prominent ""boxcar"" feature; stem on some small features; medium/large hexcentrics and small/medium tri-cams proved useful; belay near the top of the boxcar.  p6: traverse left about 80 ft. to some brush (recommend simul-climbing this pitch); continue on some 4th class scrambling (that can also be simul-climbed) to a notch with a tree that is the start of the ""Cat Burglar"" pitch  p7 (Cat Burglar pitch): climb up the exposed face toward the left of a big roof; upper part of the pitch has scarce protection.  p8: traverse left past a tree, then up a bulge; past the bulge, there is an exposed traverse up and left taking big protection; the next belay is on a small perch with a tree.  p9: head up a chute and then some stemming in a left-facing dihedral ending at another big tree for belay.  p10: some tricky climbing up a small right-facing dihedral up to a small roof, then up and beyond a tree into a wide chute to a small belay stance taking small pro in cracks on the right wall of the wide chute.  p11: continue up the wide chute, then right and up around a roof up to a little notch in the rock.  p12-14: we simul-climbed 3rd-4th class; the ridge started to flatten out and approach the summit; we unroped just a short scramble from the summit plateau; the last bit of scrambling was mostly 3rd class along the ridge with a couple of exposed 4th class moves.  Descent: Walk toward the left (west) down a moderate wide slope, being careful not to angle too far left, lest you get cliffed out. The trick is to stay right far enough to enter the descent gully while avoiding cliffs. Descend about 2,000 feet in a steep gully on mixed scree & talus. Stay to the left of the gully to hike on dirt rather than scree. When the gully flattens out and becomes consistently forested, angle right or you will miss the dirt road and end up on the lower dirt road by the Rio Brazos and lots of extra bushwhacking.

Do as a lead/follow. I have been told that it can be done in a single pitch on a 70 meter rope, with the second following through. We did it on a 60, and used the mid point anchor.

Pull through a steep roof, then keep it together for the techy finish. Descent - The raps are steep!  Dont miss any stations and be sure to have some method of ascension incase you botch it.  Double rope rappels.  Rap from the top, past the pitch 5 anchors that have no rap station to an independent anchor just right of the pitch 4 anchor.  Do not rap from P4 anchors, doing so will be more likely leave you stranded in mid air.   Rap from the anchors near P4 to another independent rap station on the middle of the wall between pitches 2 and 3 (not on route).  Be sure to kick hard the whole way down so that you don't get stuck in space.  If you do get stuck in space, unable to reach the substation, keep an eye out or a loose-looking microwave-sized clump of rock that can be delicately lassoed to pull you in enough to resume kicking off the wall and penduluming  over to the rap station. Rap from the substation down to the big ledge that holds the pitch one anchor. Walk north along the ledge to the P1 anchor.  Single rope rap to the ground.  Watch the rope eating crack.",{105853735: 4}

Shuffle the feet then crank up to a slopey edge and dyno for the obvious jug.  Clip the third bolt, then enter the crux. The pockets are big here, but they aren't very deep or positive, and the feet suddenly turn into tiny edges, making the next couple of moves desperate.

Unfortunately this line is also the only drainage for a significantly sized canyon above.  As such, dirt, leaves, rocks and water stream down the route every time it rains, which is rare, but, due to the sparsity of climbers, happens frequently enough to ensure that you will need to clean this route before you attempt a redpoint.  The crux is at the 3rd bolt, so I recommend you head up from the ground and see how it goes before you commit to the several hours it will take to brush down the entire route.  If you can manage the extremely powerful crux, nothing above the lip of the overhanging will slow you down.    In addition to the water hazard, this route is often used by the local Search and Rescue squad for various training exercises, and features a convenient rap anchor at the cliff top.  For this reason, you might thing twice about fixing your draws for an extended period of time.    The route begins with long, powerful moves on a slightly leftward traverse, to a sick-hard move at the 2nd bolt.  From here, a commiting dyno leads to a good jug.  At the 4th bolt, a technical rock-over gains the headwall, followed by a left-ward traverse to an easy stance.

From the big ledge, climb cracks up and left past the second bolt to the big, positive horizontal crack to the third bolt. (I unclipped the second bolt from the rope because I worried, no doubt unnecessarily, that the huge block that forms the stellar horizontal crack could break away and that would be ugly).     Hand traverse out left towards the arete to a huge, immediate dose of exposure and figure out how to get your feet up on the horizontal crack and the fourth bolt. These moves are super cool!  Climb just right of the arete up steep rock into the very green, licheny rock for a good rest. Technical moves through the green face lead up through some fun side pulls and an angling crack. One last thin face move gets you to the nice horizontal hand ledge and then the anchors shared with Memory Block.

Dennis Jackson asked me for a name to this route and I hadn't yet come up with one for his last Falcon guidebook, so there are citations that refer to the route as ""unnamed"".  I spent a fair bit of time prying on the plate with a crowbar, and then banging on it with a 4# mallet, couldn't get most of it to go. With that said, I still wouldn't put gear in it, but pulling on it should be fine (use judgement). But you can climb through it at easier than 5.8, Id think. There is good gear above and below it. My FA attempt was originally ground-up, but I was stopped at the crux section by buckets of gravel and dirt falling into my face as I tried to use the hand crack. I came down, hiked around, and rapped in from the top. I evacuated a huge amount of debris from this upper section of crack, which turned out to be fairly larger than hand size (the #4 or 5 section), and I was ultimately happy with how well it cleaned and climbed.  There is a possibility that sections of this route had been tried in the past, but if so, they certainly didn't use the same exit. They could have aided left and finished-out via a separate, left crack system. Its plausible, but again, not likely.  George Perkins : ""This crack's crux is harder than it looks, making it another good one on the Diablo trad circuit. The flake is scary, but at least the climbing is easy at this point. Climb up to this flake, place pro behind. Above is a nice left-facing hand crack; then you'll reach an overhanging flared slot through a roof with a good hand crack in the back. This is the crux, and even with good hand jams, it's harder than it looks, but only a few moves of this tricky section. Sustained hand cracks lead to the anchor at the rim. Pro is great, after you pass the big hollow flake. ""","{105805636: 2, 105827495: 2}"

Great positioning high above the canyon with good gear makes this climb worth it. It might be found hard at 5.10, especially if you're not tuned into Indian Creek-style crack climbing. While the route's name is ominous, the Guillotine Flake for which it was named was removed from the route long ago.  Only the excellent 2nd pitch is described here. The original first pitch is in the lower tier and so it is posted on the Grotto Left (East Side) page; named Snazz by Nazz by some.  Start at the 2-bolt belay below the upper tier. 30' of chossy blocks leads to the business, an obvious overhanging hand/fist crack in a dihedral (crux). This physical portion is passed by good jamming in the corner, or by strenous liebacking, but is followed by a rest. Next is a 2nd crux, an overhanging thin hands/hands section (also solid 5.10). Easier crack climbing leads to a 2-bolt anchor just below the rim.  The first ascent history, seems to have a bit of lack of clarity. *Karl Kiser says this route was not climbed by the old timers, because of a ""huge flake left of the crack down low"" which he, with Chris Kessler were able to clean from the climb. This would have been in the mid 90s (?). *Denny Newell reported he and Jacques (?) climbed this line in the mid 90s, and that there was a giant scary flake that was going to give them the axe. He said they were searching for the 5.11 noted in Rock-N-Road. This was before there were any sport climbs at Diablo. *D. Jackson, in Rock Climbing New Mexico, says the FA was Ken Sims in 1989, along with Rolling Brown Out the same day. *The anchors were put in by Bradshaw, and Kisiel/Newell/Beguin.

Recover well here so you can get back on the steep arete. Exit the arete to good holds but with thuggy moves to the anchor.   A true Diablo Canyon sport climbing gem, this route is the reason the Mordor crag exists. Keith and I bolted this obvious, stunning line around 2015 but thought it was too hard and we waited til we were ready to commit a whole season to training for sending it. In the mean time, we realized we were going to need some warmup routes so we started bolting other lines nearby, and they just turned out so good we kind of got distracted from the main objective (procrastination as well??). Enter winter 2019/2020, we were ready to get it done. Realizing that we could escape out right after the first two cruxes brought the grade down from 13+ to 13b, and the prospect of us sending became far less daunting, rather achievable. But Keith got injured in late December, which was fortunate for me because he was bound to get it way sooner.

This climb has some of everything. The upper headwall has fantastic and thoughtful movement.  Route History: The original start to the Neanderthal headwall is a variation called Meanderthal that avoids all the steep power cruxes by climbing the large dihedral to its left as for Cro Magnon and Lucy. A large traverse under the roof using a linkup bolt gets you to the headwall fun. Eventually a slightly more direct start, now referred to as ""Neanderthug"", used the right-facing dihedral as for Spearhead and then traversed back left at the break. This start was then co-opted by Spearhead and didn't completely solve the rope-drag issues. Besides, many folks are perplexed by the clever movement required to climb through the steep dihedral. And finally, in early 2019, the direct steep bulge start gives the route a plumb, clean line that links right into the upper sections and reduces rope drag. I suspect that many folks will just climb the lower cruxes and clip the anchors for Spearhead (Asterisk* Redpoint only).

There was a chopped 5th bolt ahead, and a 6th bolt with a bail biner on it.

Despite the questionable quality of rock on some of these pitches, I did enjoy the route. But, as with many Diablo routes, WEAR YOUR HELMET!. I was not completely thrilled about the first two pitches, however, the third pitch is STELLAR and on beautiful rock, and the crux section (very top of the climb) is on immaculate rock with awesome exposure (formation called The Shield)! I would give this route four stars, but the first two pitches, and the first section of the fourth pitch, bring the star rating down just a little, in my opinion. So 3 stars.    P-1 (5.11a)*: Climb up mediocre rock (appears crumbly but nothing came off! Looks like dragon scales) to a ledge with a belay anchor.     P-2 (5.10a): Climb suspect rock up a right trending ramp (tread lightly here!) up to the next set of anchors. The climbing is actually easier than .10a, but I gave it a higher rating because it feels harder due to the crappy quality of the rock.    P-3 (5.10d)****: This pitch has great moves with nice exposure climbing on great rock! Beautiful sustained climbing. The route can be made easier or more difficult depending on exactly where you climb it (climbing directly up to bolts vs going off to the side a little.)    P-4 (5.11b/c)**: Starts on suspect rock through the first few bolts, and continues up toward The Shield.  There are some rather large boulders along this pitch, so watch out! Will climb go a crack to the left of the headwall. Will not move onto the actual headwall until around the second to last bolt on the route, where you will traverse to the right, EXPOSURE! Clip the final bolt and find the hidden hold (hint, high and right), and pull yourself to glory. DO IT, the fall is completely safe! (NOTE: In JM Beverly's book, this route is listed as 5.10 b/c.

The climbing is actually quite nice with potential to be better with traffic but the protection isn't the greatest requiring a cool head and lots of hold-testing.      Start up about 15 feet left of Pale Face where it looks reasonable to head up towards a roof about 25 feet up. Choose your poison to tackle the roof--the left crack offers good protection but hard moves while the right crack looks to be a bit easier but has virtually no pro. Maybe even stay to the right of the roof altogether as shown in the RC:NM book?  We chose the left crack.      Above the roof work your way up and into the right crack getting pro while you can and eventually enjoy a big sigh of relief when you clip the first of three bolts.  Above the bolt, enjoy the climbing up the very shallow dihedral on steepening rock placing some gear when you can and clipping two more bolts.     More fun but cautious climbing continues up the shallow corner through some small bushes and dirty rock to a small roof. Beverly's Jemez Rock book shows the line going left past this roof but you don't want to do that unless you like hard and unprotected climbing.  Instead, turn the roof to the right being careful not to pull off the very big block that forms the bottom of the roof.  Easier climbing above through another small roof takes you to the two-bolt/chains anchor.

But the upper parts were horribly loose and sketchy.    With that in mind they looked to the left and found some clean, short dihedrals leading to a clean panel of rock to finish up on.  The dihedrals and final panel didn't protect well so they hand drilled four protection bolts on the upper part of the wall.

I tried to follow the line named ""The Trough,"" which is route #17a in Beverly (2006:219-220), but I failed.  This current route description is more of a mini-trip report, warning where not to go when you try this route.  When I figure out the correct line, I'll update this page.  Anyone have any beta?    Beverly notes that The Trough is an 'easy crack in cornersystem with bushes' that has a 2-bolt anchor.  His topo indicates that the anchors lay at about the same elevation as those of Sunbaked and Protein Supplement to the right.    Although I couldn't see an anchor from the ground or from the top of Sunbaked, I set off up Beverly's illustrated line for The Trough.  After pulling through two fairly fun little roofs, the dihedral got rapidly dirtier and looser, although it stays at 5.7.  By the time I was above the level of where the anchor was supposedly indicated, the crack system degenerated badly.  For example, just below a beautiful 2-foot-diameter dish on the left face of the dihedral, a microwave-oven-sized shattered block is poised to fall out at the drop of a pin; this block will certainly take out your belayer if it goes.   Most importantly, I found no bolted anchors anywhere in this vicinity or to the right.  Although it appears to stay at about 5.7 above that point, and you might be able to top out and walk off, it'd be a loose nightmare.  I chose instead to downclimb the whole 'route'.    In retrospect, I may have gone right after the first roof when I was supposed to go left (see the beta photo for the possible left option), but I still didn't see any anchor bolts in that area.  However, there is a mystery bolt line way up high, between, and well above the tops of, The Trough and Vitaman (see the beta photo); anyone know what that is/was?","{105827495: 1, 107227104: 1, 106081147: 0}"

It's the first route you'll encounter as you head up the old, western approach trail to the Winter Wall proper. It can be done in one long pitch (recommended!) or two shorter pitches. If done in one long pitch, bring ~22 draws and back clean a few in critical spots on the first pitch to reduce rope drag up high.  It's common for parties to climb just the first pitch but you're really missing out on the best climbing of this route if you don't climb the second pitch.   Pitch 1 - 5.9 (105'): Start up just below a large block and make leftward moves to the first bolt. Loose fourth class action gets you by a couple more bolts well to the left of Basalt Therapy to preserve that route's integrity to the roof (but resulting in bad rope drag later). Turn the roof on its left side into some dubious but easy climbing to the next bolt.  Continue up the face and shallow dihedral through a tightly bolted section (due to rock quality) to eventually work leftwards to the arête and better rock. Strongly consider back cleaning the draw from the bolt closest to the ""crack"" to reduce rope drag. Continue up trending left to the cool, airy belay on faint ledge on the arete.  Pitch 2 - 5.10+ (85'): The reason to climb this route is this pitch.

The belay stance is in an alcove on a narrow ledge. Rope-up below small tree and stay on slab left of gully to large tree with slings (1st belay) or pass this small tree, climb 10' more to a two-bolt anchor (no rings/chain, just two bolts/hangers.)  Pitch 2 (5.7 or 5.10) - From here you can continue left on 5.7 slab to a gear anchor (#2 camalot and a bigger nut work great) on a sloping, nice ledge at the base of wall (pass 2nd tree with slings - this tree is 61 meters from the starting ledge). The other choice (preferred) climbs up right from the first belay to a bolted 5.10 slab.  Pitch 3 (5.8) - The 3rd pitch is stellar. Bring adequate runners for slinging chicken heads. Three choices on the finish. The standard goes direct into the short steep cleft with a finger to hand sized cam protecting the final 5.8 moves. Other finishes go left on 5.7 unprotectable slab with wild exposure or right into the loose gully (5.5) to the flat top with a big tree with slings on it. One of the best 5.8 trad pitches anywhere. ""The top pitch of the Five Eight Variant was pure magic, dramatis, steep and yet with superb holds"" Sir Chris Bonnington.  Pitch 4 (5.8) - The original BMPM route ended at a bolted belay/rappel anchor at the top of pitch 3. But do yourself a favor and climb one more 40m pitch to the summit of the Questa Flatiron. Instead of stopping at the belay/rappel anchors at the top of pitch 3, continue up to the large tree with slings on it. From the big tree with slings, climb up a short slab with a finger crack to reach the ridge. Climb left along the ridge staying on the ridge proper or just to the left. Clip a single bolt protecting an airy, thin move to a huge, round hueco. Cruise great chicken heads to the summit. From the summit, do a 40' rap off a bolted anchor down into the gully behind the summit and walk back down to your packs at the base.

Find a bolted belay at the top of the line, a bit below the level of the main Questa roof.  All bolted, about 10 in total (don't bring any trad rack except if linking or if doing the variation) .  Bolts aren't close enough to cheat, you have to climb (5.12, 150').  Variation to p3: Start the same as above, but at a stance on a dike at the 3rd or 4th bolt, a bolt leads to the left.  I haven't gone this way, but it looks as though you angle left, passing some holes (possible gear?), pull over the lip (possible intermediate belay?), then follow bolts up and right to the same belay.  The book calls this 5.11+ (after the initial 5.12- start).  This would allow you to bypass the crux.Pitch 4.  Traverse right 30' to the Question of Balance 2-bolt belay below the left (easier, standard) roof exit.  I placed a small nut as the only pro on this pitch, a #00 TCU or similar might also fit (5.9R, 35').  We linked this with the previous pitch and would recommend that (unless you want to lower and work the crux).Pitch 5.  Climb the 5.10 roof, and continue to the top by the variation of your choice.  The 5.10 slab line with 4 spaced bolts straight above the roof makes for the most sustained finish.  It's runout, but if you survived pitch 3, you'll do just fine.  It's 190' to a belay at a tree.  3rd class to the top.  Easier finishes go to the right after you pull the roof (see Question of Balance page).","{105827495: 4, 107583233: 4}"

[Note this climb is NOT the one with new bolts immediately right of Question's p1- that is a new 5.11 variation start to Question; Pretty Face begins farther right of that start.] Spy the lower left end of the obvious roof to get your bearings. A tricky 5.10- slab move without good pro immediately near you lets you move left to a new bolt [this replaced a partially driven fixed pin here] at the lower left corner of this roof.  [You could also climb a direct start to this point-- steeper angling cracks from the left to get to this bolt at 5.10+.] Step left to two twig-like pine ""trees"", and follow 5.10- cracks and flakes, passing another fixed pin at a face section, and reach a 3-bolt anchor after 150'. Although the guidebooks and the old topo suggest to belay in a lower location, it is better to do as described here. Excellent pitch.Pitch 2: Traverse left from the belay to the first bolt (potential to fall onto the belay with a 5.10 move or two). The well-protected crux of the climb is the 5.11 slab section between the 1st and 2nd bolts. After the 2nd bolt, the difficulty eases but it's a 25' run-out getting to the next bolt. Before you get to the 3rd bolt, you can cut left on an easier but unprotected rail to join Question of Balance pitch 2 finger crack, or continue up the thin face past the 3rd bolt, after which you'll join Question midway through pitch 2 anyway. Follow this 5.9 finger crack up and right to an anchor with bolts & chains. Classic thin face/slab climbing.Rappel from the p2 anchor to the ground with 2 60m ropes (it will just barely reach); or continue up Question of Balance, which is recommended and the next 2 pitches are great.  If you keep going and top out the dome, it should be about 5 pitches total, plus some easy scrambling.

If you're considering it, chances are you've already climbed ""Tostadas"", which will help for getting oriented.  By comparison, the more popular ""Tostadas"" is longer, with an easier crux, and has more interesting climbing overall compared to ""Con Questa Libre"".  It's way shorter and less serious than ""Jonny Questa"" and the 5.11s in the middle of the dome. Though discontinuous in difficulty, everything on Questa is good-- and ""Con Questa Libre"" is sheltered from wind and gets sun earlier than most.    We combined ""Taos Rock"" P1-P3 into 2 pitches, would recommend that to avoid ""tricky belays"", and is described this way below.    Look for the next R-facing corner system to the right of ""Tostadas"".  This should be to the left of a ""pillar"" with 2 trees.  The start is to the right of a grimy arch/cave-looking feature.    P1.  Climb up into the R-facing corner.  You'll find a ledge at 50' (optional belay).  We started in bushy cracks, but it might be possible to traverse into this from the right.

Jonny Questa,106205160,Trad,105979184,5.10c,500,5,3.1,7.0,"Jonny Questa is another quality climb on Questa Dome, with 2 excellent pitches, and a couple more decent pitches, and just enough scariness to get your attention. JQ is worthwhile, however, Tostadas Comquesta or Question of Balance are probably better choices for a first route on Questa Dome, as this one has one heady pitch and does not have as much sustained quality climbing overall compared to those other climbs. This climb is in Taos Rock but not Rock Climbing New Mexico.   Pitch 1&2: There are 2 choices for the first 2 pitches:  *The recommended alternate start to the first pitch which is described in 'Taos Rock' as the 1st two pitches of Sequestered: This alternate start was done about a year after the FA by Mike Head and David Baltz, that starts directly below the slab on the original second pitch. Begin about 200' down slope from the standard start at the base of a slab with a prominent hand crack diagonaling across it from the right. P1: Climb up the slab (some bushwhacking) to a ledge at the base of the diagonal crack and belay (100ft). P1B: Follow the crack to the base of a short steep headwall. The headwall goes at 5.10a thanks to a large semi-attached flake and is followed by an excellent layback corner. Belay at the prominent tree (100 ft.). These pitches can be combined (60m).  Pitch 2: Move up to a small roof which accepts a large cam, then step left and climb a spicy (5.9R) quartz dike. Step left around the arête and belay at the lower of the 6' trees (see P2 description of Original Start below that joins this variation at the small roof).  *The easier original start, as shown in 'Taos Rock': Start a 100 yards up the hill from the cave on the left flank of Questa Dome. Pitch 1: Traverse right across easy slab to gain the prominent left-facing corner and belay off the tree jutting from the obvious crack in the right face of the dihedral (5.5, 120'). Pitch 2: Climb the hand and fingers crack above the tree and step right around the arête onto a nice slab. Climb down the slab a ways and friction right till you can move up again below a shallow roof/arch. Protect under the roof (important), then step left around the end of the roof and proceed 20 feet up a thin vertical quartz dike (5.9R). At the top of the dike, step left around a corner and into a corner leading up to a couple of small trees. Belay at lower tree in the left-facing corner about 20' below an obvious roof (150 ft.).  Pitch 3: Cruise up to the big roof split by a crack up to the left, clipping a 1/4"" bolt just below it. Turn the gear-protected 5.10 roof, followed by easier low-angle crack climbing in a corner. Belay at the highest tree in this corner system. Excellent pitch. (5.10, 120')  Pitch 4: (a) From the high tree, climb a finger crack on the right wall. Place good pro at the top of this finger crack. Walk to your right on a 4"" ledge for 20' to the arete, where you will see 2 bolts (1 new, 1 old) just out of reach above you. A 5.9 highstep lets you clip the bolt (don't fall first). The crux of the climb (5.10 if you're over six foot, 5.11 otherwise) is in the next 2 or 3 moves after clipping the bolt. Reaching a jug, move right around the arete. It's not obvious at this point that you're going to find any gear placements for the next 30' or so, but persevere. Climb the beautiful arete, exposed 5.9R with some interesting moves. You will find (marginal) gear in a couple of places here, but I felt this was ""serious R"" not ""wimpy R"". Look for a small TCU placement on the second ledge up the arete, and a keyhole stopper in a tiny solution pocket a bit higher. After the difficulty is passed, belay at the biggest tree nearby, after another 20' of easy climbing. Memorable pitch. (5.10/11 with 5.9R, 130'). (b) The Taos Rock guidebook suggests you can escape without climbing this pitch by taking one of the bushy 5.8 dihedrals to the left, which would be a good option in inclement (or windy) weather.

There is interesting climbing on all the pitches, but still some flakiness from lack of traffic. The 3rd and 4th pitches are striking from below, as the left of 2 long continuous diagonal crack systems left of the big roofs on Questa Dome.  The best start is the first two pitches of ""Sequestered"", described here. One can also use the original first two pitches of ""Jonny Questa"", which is easier and not as interesting climbing (see the Jonny Questa page for that described).  Begin just up and right of the lowest point of Questa Dome, under a small left facing corner with an 8"" crack. There will be a big flat roof about 150' from you, and the first belay is at a tree visible on the upper left part of your view upwards.  Pitch 1: Start up the corner for 20'. Step left on a slab. Climb easy cracks passing some bushes to a stance (optional belay). Angle up and left on an easy hand crack, turn a small roof.

Pitch 2: From the right of the tree, slab straight up and slightly right to an overlap/roof.

From under the mini roof, layback it, go left (not right, which is ""tostadas"") follow the dihedral right until it gets to a decent ledge. At this ledge punch it left to the 12ft overhung face on dark orange rock. Climb out left on a jug and mantle to find a bolt anchor.

You'll find beautiful rock, wonderful climbing, and some thin sections on this adventurous climb. The route description is in both guidebooks, but recommend splitting the pitches as below:  Rope up on the left side of Questa Dome, below a large left-facing corner, about 50' left of the start of Question of Balance.  P1: (190' 5.10- same as Questar) Start in a large left facing corner before transferring [left] to the dirty crack at ~20'. Follow easy climbing up and right (optional belay in here) till finding a left angling hand traverse crack leading to a small roof. After the roof, traverse left on face holds to a hidden bolt (upgraded recently) then up to the layback crack. Belay at the tree.  P2: (135' 5.11+)[Paul Horak's original topo gives this pitch 5.11- while Rock Climbing NM gives it 5.12- the consensus seems to be about in the middle.] Step right from the tree and make a couple slab moves heading up and aiming for the roof. Traverse right under the roof till you can clip a bolt and turn it. Move left aiming for a second bolt and fun vertical crack climbing (50m belay). After the vertical climbing follow the ever thinning right angling crack till it becomes a seam. Keep it together through the harder moves above your small stoppers and RPs for the last six feet till to a good ledge at the bottom of the large right facing corner with some fixed gear.  P3: (160' 5.12-) Head up crack and chicken heads till you can commit to big holds on the arete to the left. As the holds run out mantle and clip a 1/4"" bolt above your head. The thin flake I used to make this move flexed a bit, you'll know it when you see it. The climbing following these four bolts up and then right is definitely the technical crux, put your slab face on if you've climbed clean to here because it's THIN. After the bolts move back into the crack where there are two pins in the thin part and gear up higher. The guide says to belay on gear above the pins but it seems like an unnecessary hanging belay. Instead continue onto the 5.8 R climbing on chicken heads till you can move right to a small ledge with a crack for gear and a large interesting looking water gutter crack to its right.  I think two of the four bolts have been replaced on this pitch and the others felt solid when I hung on them.  P4: (5.8) I followed the dirty crack corner with a few loose rocks in it above the belay. The dike to the right looked fun and clean but unprotectable.

Tostadas Comquesta is a good choice if you've done Question of Balance or are looking for a 5.10.  Warmer in the morning and more sheltered from the wind than the climbs to its left.Pitch 1: Follow easy cracks right of the big right-leaning right facing corner on the east end of the main face. (5.6) Topos show to belay in the corner below the first stepped roof. With todays' ropes and racks, most will want to combine this and the 2nd pitch. (I've listed the pitch separately to be consistent with the guidebooks).Pitch 2: This pitch follows clean slabs to the right of the main dihedral. Climb up to the roof, undercling and traverse right, step up to a bolt. Climb up to the bigger 2nd roof, undercling and traverse right and head up to a 2-bolt chain anchor below a steeper slab. The traversing might be a little scary for those who aren't used to slabs (5.9+). If this scared you, it may be useful to know that you can rap from this belay to the ground with 1 rope, because P3 is harder and more heady.Pitch 3: Climb clean slab straight up (potential to fall onto belay), passing 2 bolts to a diagonaling seam (crux, 5.10 PG13). It's a little spacey between the bolts but not bad by TP/Questa standards.

Start up the thin face just to the right of Thunder Toad.   Get established in the wide fissures under the little roof, then head up the wide seam out the left side.  If you want to do this route as 2 pitches, at about 85 feet, you can belay at the chain anchors for Thunder Toad and Danger Mouse, or ignore the bolts and build a gear anchor.  From that ledge, continue slightly right, up the easier, but interesting layback seam.

Traverse slightly right to a crack system up the bulging headwall, where fun moves take you to the top.    If the second is interested in a diversion during their climb, they can climb up to the first seam, clean the gear, and then drop back down and traverse right about 20 feet to a greenish knobby waterstreak that makes for an interesting ~5.11 toprope.  The leader should put a long runner on the pieces at the base of the headwall ahead of time, to minimize the pendulum if the second is planning on exploring this option.

Holthouse to Hell,106518748,Trad,105994023,5.11-,220,2,3.8,9.0,"Holthouse to Hell is probably the easiest route up the intimidating wall right of Serpentine Crack with the Holthouse climbs, and is the best climb I've done so far at Tres Piedras at this grade or easier, at least, as far as I can recall.    The Direct Start (5.11) is recommended, it adds another challenging crux to the climb but the result is the most aesthetic line.  Begin just right of Serpentine Crack, face climb past 2 bolts, and reach an easy runout.  Or use the original start to reach this same section by traversing over from Serpentine Crack past a black bolt.    If you look carefully, you'll see 3 bolted lines that you could follow from either of these starts.  Take the middle of the 3 lines, which is the most natural and obvious way to go, going pretty much straight up clipping new bolts.  Pull through a roof, a crazy mantle onto a chickenhead, and through another roof to more classic TP slabbing.  Up high, there are a few options; route find the easiest way to a ledge with small oak trees and belay.  An short and easy, but poorly protected, 5.2 pitch finishes the climb (you can't get all the way to the top in a single pitch with a 60m rope).    The bolts are in great places to protect the hardest moves.    This section of cliff is confusing because the routes have different starting variations and split from one another, and both guidebooks have errors/omissions. Taos Rock shows this line as ""Learn to Forget"", and lists Holthouse to Hell as the line to its left.  RC:NM shows this line correctly, but shows ""Learn to Forget"" as angling farther right and incorrectly lists it as 5.11- (and it also doesn't show the left bolted line).

Though this is a worthwhile climb, a bit of flaky grunge to the right, and the temptation of significantly easier climbing to the left in the lower half detract, to some extent.    The old guide from the late 1970s(?) notes some people climbed as far as the tree, not sure on exactly how, but didn't continue to the top (THE MOSAIC- unfinished - probable 5.11).

At the top of the crack (ca. 105 feet up) is a nice ledge on the left (where, as Jackson notes, ""a controversial set of shiny fixed anchors has recently appeared"").     If you rap off from this point, a single 60m rope will take you down to just about 5 feet above the ground, where you land on the gently sloping rock apron, so watch the rope ends!   Above the ledge, you're out of the crack; a short face takes you to a horizontal seam; traverse right and then up onto easier ground -- some people have finished Chicken Heads this way also.

Dave asked for a disclaimer: ""my memory of climbing routes is not perfect."" Dave updated the photo for Dung Alley, his route is the one on the right in bright orange.]  The route is just left of the obvious dead/broken tree stump coming out of the rock, about 5 feet off the ground.  The first 20 feet is pure run-out friction of 5.7, maybe with a 5.8 move or two. A fall here would be a slide and a belayer could easily catch the leader as he/she might slide back to the ground. (You can also walk up the crack that the tree stump is in.) There is a good boulder to sling at the base for an anchor for a belayer.  One could probably protect the horizontal crack that intersects the tree stump with a flex-stem small cam, but I preferred to stuff one into the vertical crack to the left end of the horizontal crack. I followed the crack up the right side of the ""buttress"" to the little tuft of grass seen in the picture. The grass is still there and I recall using the spot right above the grass as a place for both feet while I placed a cam in the crack just above the stance. I then veered a bit left, working along the big boilerplates, some of them a bit hollow-sounding so I didn't yard on them very vigorously. You can go right or left around the big boilerplate flake in the ""lichen band"" in the picture; I think I did it both ways over two climbs and the climbing seemed the same either way. Above this big boilerplate, there are a few places to protect in cracks with small cams and mid-sized nuts in this area, and there are two solid flakes (one small, one large) that are great to sling for pro. Above this large boilerplate, you can look up and to the right and see a piece of static line that runs through at least one bolt hanger (I didn't actually see the second hanger but it looked like there was one based on how the static line was hanging) as the rap anchor if you are using a 50 meter rope. Since I had a 60m, I continued climbing toward the left, where you can now see the two bolt hangers (no chains or other gear) near the top, indicated by the two red Xs in the picture. After clipping one of them, I explored the top of the route, delighted to find a nice fat crack about 10 feet back from the lip at the top for a fine anchor with several #3 to #3.5 cams and a place for a large nut or two. No problem reaching and tying into the anchor I made with a 60m rope. I would estimate there were about 20 feet of spare rope with my belayer.  I would rate the climb a solid 5.7, with fairly consistent moves once you are past the first vertical crack. There is lots of lichen on the climb, but I thought there were plenty of solid hand and footholds on good features that I didn't worry about the lichen. I suspect one could also climb more to the right from the start and end up in line with the anchor identified as the one for Summer Dreams (with the piece of static line), but I think the route I took was more fun, still safe and gained an additional 30 feet or so of climbing. It is also obvious that few people climb any parts of this route since there was no chalk and plenty of lichen.  The path to the descent gully is to head due west off the top for about 50 feet, then drop down left (to the south) in the obvious spot to the descent gully - it is hard to miss.

Although it's given an ""R"" for protection in the guidebooks, I think its similar to Techtonics as far as headiness (you have to be willing to climb a bit more than usual above your last gear), and confident 5.11 leaders should give'r a go.    Go up thin edges and plates to a high 1st bolt.  A hard move after the 2nd bolt gains an obvious flake.  I wasn't so sure about gear in, or behind this flake, but you can get some pieces in a crack above it.  At about the 3rd bolt, it looks like a blank face, going left, then up, then back right, is the way; don't get tempted to join Techtonics.  The difficulty eases soon after the 4th bolt.  While you're looking at the 4th and 2nd bolts, old buttonheads, and deciding whether to punch it to the next crack, remember that Couleur put those in on lead from hooks, as he on-sighted, which must have been pretty fun.

I found that to move past the second bolt I needed to move left to the arete to the left and pull on small knobs to reach a right-slanting rail.

This section can be avoided by starting farther right, but if you want to avoid this move, you'll probably be better off avoiding the rest of the climb too.

Start at the base of a nice crack/right facing dihedral. Follow this crack to its end, good pro placements throughout. At the end of this crack I placed two 0.4 Camalots, as I thought the face above was quite run-out. Gather your nerve, and make some friction moves. The next 4 feet or so after your last protection are the worst then it lightens up until you can reach up and clip a bolt (this is also the third bolt of Mad Bolter). After clipping the bolt continue straight up through the crux and some more friction climbing (undercling), and clip the next bolt. After clipping the second bolt you will come on another crack, and above are a few easy face/friction moves to a two bolt anchor.

With a difficult start followed by much easier climbing, this climb is either frustrating or unexciting, for most people.    The crux is getting established off the ground, prior to the first bolt.  Once your feet are 4 feet high, you're through the crux.  If you fall, the landing is flat and soft.  No harder than 5.9 from here to the 2nd bolt.  Soon after the 2nd bolt, the climbing eases considerably to 4th class.  You can angle to the left and build and anchor and scramble down the gully, or go up and right to the anchor for Eds Mind, from which you can rappel with a single rope.    Regarding the rating:    The old guide says: 5.10d     Rock Climbing: NM says: 5.9+     Taos Rock says: 5.9+ but shows it in the wrong location (where Ground Up is).   I say: The crux moves are harder than any moves you find on most 5.9s.  I think that if the crux was more than a few feet off the ground, this would be 5.10 or perhaps 5.10+.  In my opinion, being 3 feet off the ground with a good landing changes the rating even if the moves are the same.

That wheel was on a horse-drawn carriage transporting two European-trained east coast artists to Mexico. Bert G. Phillips and Ernest L. Blumenschein stayed in the Taos area to have the wheel repaired, became enchanted with the light and the rich culture and stayed. Word spread in Paris, New York, and St Louis; associates of the two artists began visiting Taos. In 1915, the first formal meeting of the Taos Society of Artists was held with six members present. Over the next few years the membership grew to twelve.

A horizontal crack/string of pockets provides your last pro before the ledge above the overhangs. Climb up left of the overhangs over less than stellar rock. Once on the ledge, go all the way left. There is some pro here, then an solid, if short, horizontal crack a few moves up over what is still quite steep terrain.

Pitches 2 and 3 link together well - pitch 4 may link with the final pitch without too much drag. However you climb it - A VERY FUN OUTING!! 1st PITCH (85 feet) - 5.9+**/*** Start to the right of Stones of Sisyphus and climb a right diagonaling access pitch on good rock to a ledge which is to the right of the first upper cave. There is a tricky traverse move at the 4th bolt. Alternately one can climb to the right at the 3rd bolt and avoid the traverse move (perhaps easier). Climb past the overlap with some fun moves and follow easy rock up to the ledge with a large cactus on the left side (9 bolts). 2nd PITCH (60 feet) - 5.10c**** ""The Slab Pitch"" Climb great small edges past 7 bolts to a belay stance up and right. There are a few tricky balance moves at the 3rd and 4th bolt but you are always reaching to good positive holds. Some GREAT! rock and fun slab moves on this pitch (8 bolts). 3rd PITCH (60 feet) - 5.10c/d**** ""Central Pillar Pitch"" Move left from the belay and climb straight up toward the pillar above. Do some tricky moves to stand on a small ledge and get past it. Continue climbing up into the right facing corner above (""The Central Pillar""). Climb the fun corner to a 5.9ish exit onto a small ledge at the top of the dihedral. Another great pitch! This one links with the 2nd pitch well (7 bolts). 4th PITCH (65 feet) - 5.10b/c*** ""Hollow Flake Pitch"" Move up off the left side of the belay climbing ""gently"" along and over the ""Hollow Flake"". From the top of the flake follow bolts up and right to a tricky bulge move (moving far right is easiest way). Continue straight up past the bulge to a small overhang, then traverse up and left to a small belay alcove. Still a few dirty spots on this pitch but some fun climbing (7 bolts). 5th PITCH (80 feet) - 5.10**/*** ""Summit Pitch"" Climb up and right off the belay. The rock looks loose and funky but its actually quite solid (still a bit of ""onion skin"" in places though). Make a tricky move below the roof to get hands to the ledge and stand on it by pulling into the wide crack. Continue up the crack using some jams and face holds to the left on the slabby face. As the angle kicks back continue climbing the face to arrive at anchors on the right side of the summit block (8 or 9 bolts?). DESCENT (3 single rope rappels to the ground) Rappel off the summit anchors to to the top of pitch 4 (you might have to down clip to get into the anchor). Alternately one can rappel to the top of The Pillar pitch from the summit anchors (this risks getting the rope stuck in the upper crack if you're not carefully!). From either the 4th belay or The Pillar belay, make a 2nd rappel to the anchors down and 30' right which are 36 meters from the ground. From these anchors make one doubled 70M rope rappel to the broken ledges near the higher ground on the right side of Trojan Wall. With a 60M rope you might try to rappel 5 to 4, 4 to 2(close), 2 would make it to downclimbable ledges near the ground - or do 4 shorter rappels.","{106831774: 4, 107723931: 3, 106291936: 1}"
