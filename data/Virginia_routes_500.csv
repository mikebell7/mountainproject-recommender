Left hand turns into press/pushup position and pressing on this and the right foothold move up until you can bring your left foot over the roof.

Although you could put in a cam here, it is not needed since a bolt is right above. From here the climb becomes a friction-fest, but is well protected until a right-tending discontinuous crack. The crux is between the 3rd and 4th bolt. A Purple Alien cam was used midway up this discontinuous crack during the first ascent. Above the crack, go up the slab to the left on finger pocket cracks past three more bolts.

The route ends when you top out on Three Amigos.On any downward traversing pitch, consider letting the stronger climber follow rather than lead.  Route finding skills may be tested on your first attempt.Depending on time of the year, you'll encounter some or a lot of lichen and loose pine needles, which are very slippery.It may not be a good idea to climb this on a very busy day.","{106097293: 3, 107544688: 3, 107935778: 2, 107792163: 0}"

The crimps aren't glued on, but ""reinforcement"" so the hold wouldn't break off in the future. The mystery cementer added a small, usually hard to see, stripe of cement in the back of the holds... I doubt the crimps were ever tested after the gluing as most edges of the crimps and flakes were extremely thin, chipping down or breaking when I initially attempted to use them.

Despite the name, the Konnarock Block is a full sized boulder, not a smaller ""block"" as it's title may suggest, but block rhymes nicely with Konnarock so I went with it. Here's the beta...     Walk up past the blunt arete with the ""Konnarock (stand/sit)"" going up it, and stop at the large Yellow Birch tree that is growing close to the boulder. just before it you will find a nice slab line that scales directly up the side of the boulder.    Stand start on whatever's clever and delicately pull on the small nubbins that give way to better holds which allow you to gain the top ledge for the top out. Super fun!
