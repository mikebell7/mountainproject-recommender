On the morning of April 20th, 1999 Rachel seemed not to be paying attention in class, preoccupied with something she was writing in her journal.  Then, sometime a little after 11am, while sitting with a friend outside for lunch, Rachel was the first of thirteen innocent persons to be killed at Columbine High School.  Later, out of a backpack with a bullet hole, her journal was found.  On the final page she had made a drawing of her eyes with thirteen clear tears falling from them upon a rose.  The same rose was discovered drawn in another diary, this time growing up out of a columbine plant with the words 'Greater love has no man than this, that a man would lay down his life for his friends'"" (John 15:13).",{105930639: 2}

The third pitch is a 130-foot diagonalling crack that has ""challenging"" pro and I think it is the crux of the route, although the next pitch is pretty cruxy also with a iron cross move to a blind hold. - The climb has much variety on it, from thin slab climbing on the first two pitches, difficult crack climbing on the third pitch, ""interesting"" face climbing on the fourth, beautiful groove climbing on the fifth, thin/technical face on the sixth, deep groove climbing on the seventh, and easy slab on the eight. - Free climbed in April 2010 by Arno",{106092467: 4}

The exposure is big for this route due to the traversing nature of the line and the steepness of the wall below!    The route climbs the first 2 pitches of an old unfinished Haslam/Shull line along the amazing dike, and then continues along the same dike for one more pitch before gaining what is probably the largest and deepest groove on the wall.

It has the distinction of being established in a single-day first ascent by noted NC climber Jeep Gaskin and his wife Julia -- on their honeymoon!  For much of its length, Groover follows a nice arching crack system with great protection; toward the top, it uses the carved water grooves that are a hallmark of Laurel Knob.

Follow this for another full rope length and find a comfortable spot to build a gear anchor and belay.  5.7, 190'   P3 - Continue up the arching crack to a steep bulge; tiptoe over the bulge to the right and onto a sloping platform that makes a comfortable belay station.  5.7, 180'   P4 - Prepare yourself mentally for climbing high above your protection.  From the belay, climb high into the crack and place a medium-to-large cam, then downclimb until you can move out right on a bulge with quartz dikes for footing.  Continue traversing right about 30' to reach the second of two deep water grooves, then look for gear before heading up (there's supposed to be a distinctive quartz hole in the groove somewhere).

Start up a weakness above some vegetation and climb straight up past gear to the first bolt.

The first 3 pitches are 10ish, but the last headwall pitch is 11. The first 3 are the best which is why I rated this 5.10 on here.    Originally climbed up to the start of pitch 3 by the FA team. The route lay dormant for years until several teams had climbed above the original highpoint via moderate but extremely runout terrain. A hard pitch was also established through the headwall that happened to be directly above these lower pitches, so it naturally made a good direct finish. With the graces of the original FA party, the disconnected pitches were connected nicely by adding a bolt and a belay to pitch 3.     P-1    Start just left of Central Pillar, and climb the left diagonal crack to a face. Continue up the face past a bolt or two to a 2 bolt anchor.

Permission Granite,106062623,Trad,105888014,5.11,800,5,3.8,12.0,"This is the first new route to be legally completed since the acquisition of LK by the CCC, hence the name.  It roughly follows an old incomplete line for the first 1 1/2 pitches, dubbed ""Green Eggs and Ham"" (Jerry Roberts and company).  It also merges into the illegally bolted and subsequently chopped route ""Mirage"" for about 80' on pitches 3-4.     For anyone interested in a historical note regarding the controversy: The CCC, not the FA party did the chopping of the Mirage bolts but somehow missed the 2 located at the beginning of the 4th pitch.  We re-located the first one down a couple feet to provide better spacing as they were originally only about 3' apart, but left the 2nd one where it was.  Regarding the merge at P-4:  We were attempting to re-establish the upper section of Mirage as both a favor to a friend (at the time), and as the finish of our line - PG.  However, when we arrived at the high point of Mirage it quickly became clear to us that we were mislead, and that Mirage had not actually been completed. The actual high point for Mirage was at the level of the 3rd bolt on P-4 - at the start of the sustained watergroove section.      Of special note:  This route dries very quickly and is a good choice after a rain, even if the other grooves are waterfalls.  The first pitches are friction slab, and avoid the potentially wet grooves.  By the time that you make it to the grooves up higher, the sun has already had enough time to dry the wall off.      Start on the short right facing flake that is located between ""Honeranger"" and ""Oasis"".

Move right up the ramp and climb up past 2 bolts and then gear to a small sloping ledge at a bush.  Get a good rest here, and then fire the sustained shallow watergroove above past 7 more bolts to a 2 bolt anchor at a great ledge (5.10++/11a 180').      P-5 It is best to step up (via aiding off of anchor) to clip the first bolt before stepping back down and freeing the crux.  Climb the very thin crux to a small flare (protects with smallest hybrid alien/TCU or the perfectly placed nut), and climb past another bolt and some gear to a funky transition into the watergroove above.

Thanks to Dan Caldwell for having the vision and equipping the route. More info on the FA in this article: climbing.com/news/major-new…    Pitch 1: (5.11a)  See description for the Glass I (first pitch): mountainproject.com/v/the-g…    Pitch 2: (5.12d) Gain a flake that traverses left, then up, then back left.

Clip a bolt on the flake and continue the strenuous layback up the flake till it terminates where it is finally narrow enough to place a cam.  Make a big reach into a horizontal in the face, place gear, and continue through pumpy face face moves, more gear and finally a bolt.  The crux is above, made more difficult by the sustained face climbing below.   Leave the bolt and climb through slopers, thin crimps, underclings, and high steps, typical of the Looking Glass style, but tilted back more than usual.  After one more bolt and gear you reach the anchors.   Gear: smallest X4/C3 to #3 C4. 3 bolts. A #6 C4 is nice right above the belay, but not necessary.    Pitch 4: (5.12a) This pitch is one of the best at the Glass.  Leave the belay and pull a roof with a bolt at your waist.  Continue through a series of flaring crack and facey/stem moves past gear and more bolts until you can traverse left into a nice crack protected by gear.

The Glass Menagerie,105980466,Trad,106523674,5.13a,900,7,3.9,50.0,"This is the finest multipitch free-climb of its grade in the Southeast. If you want sustained climbing with big air and on perfect granite, this is the route for you. The Glass Menagerie is the obvious overhanging line up the center of the North Face of Looking Glass. It is equally good as an aid climb, as it is a free climb. Its cruxes are well protected and the rock is almost always stellar. Please be courteous to other parties if you are trying to work out the free moves. This route gets plenty of traffic and you will likely be sharing the route with other climbers if you try it during peak season.    Pitch 1: (5.11c or 5.8 C1)    Start climbing up the easy face towards the obvious shallow right facing corner. You will eventually be faced with some 5.11 moves on great rock with mostly bolts for pro. You will then encounter a funky steep section that is protected with some pretty rusty bolts and sort of rotten granite. This is short lived and eventually you will traverse out far right on a ledge system (5.8? rotten) that will take you to a bolted belay. Two nice bolts and an angle for the belay. If you are hauling make sure you put your haulbag in the proper location for takeoff on the deck.     Pitch 2: (5.12+ or C1)    This is one fine pitch of climbing. Start cranking hard moves right off the belay eventually scoring a nice kneebar rest under a shallow roof. Get ready for some thin face. Climb out past the roof and up past several bolts onto the beautiful face and end up finishing by traversing onto the exposed face placing a few cams to gain a nice little ledge belay below a flaring corner with a splitter crack in the back. Two bomber bolts will make your belay.     Pitch 3: (5.11a or C1)    After a little rest, rack up with some cams and stoppers for this pitch. You will have a hard time with this one if you don't like rattly fingers. Climb a short crack in a left facing corner with great pro to a decent ledge with at least two bomber bolts for your anchor.    Pitch 4: (5.13 or C2)    This is the money pitch. Get amped right off the bat because you will be loving the climbing here. Make some face moves off the belay. Then break out left through the improbable looking roof. You will encounter jugs, laybacks, and crimps out of this masterpiece. Keep cool for the first thirty feet off the belay. There is big air with bolts for pro and only 5.12 moves till you reach the lip of the roof. It suits the route that the hardest move is at the steepest part of the whole wall. Try and get a breather before you pull the crux. There are good bolts in between the bad ones for the whole roof. Once at the lip, pull a pretty dang hard boulder problem (V6?) and gain a thin lichen covered face. This face is about 5.10+, but it only has two bolts for pro. They are painted black so if you don't see them just keep lookin. Once you've pulled through the face you will find a two bolt belay for your anchor.    Pitch 5: 5.10+ PG 13    This pitch is only part of the free route. The aid line went up and left out of the roof, while the free variation goes up straight past the two bolts described in the previous pitch. Down climb down and left off the belay with only one bolt for pro. You may be able to get some small wires or aliens in as well. You will be angling down and left at about 7 o'clock off the belay. There was a fixed runner off the bolt when we were up there. This pitch will be sort of scary for the leader but terrifying for the second, as he will actually be doing the lead climbing. You will encounter a 2-bolt belay about twenty feet above the lip of the roof proper here.     Pitch 6: (5.10c or C2)    As Mike says below, you can link pitch 5 and 6  and save your second from doing the heinous down climb of pitch five with a semi-top rope. Either way you do it you will climb a splitter hand crack up and eventually gain a fixed nut anchor at a little roof. Traverse out left a few feet to regain the crack (crux 11.c?). Climb the hand crack that will turn into a reasonable off width that overhangs slightly and ends with a slabby right leaning finish to gain yet another two bolt anchor.     Pitch 7: (5.9+ or 5.8, C1)    Climb up off the belay pulling through some thin hands past a bulge and then on to finish the crack up on a slab. You will eventually run out of crack and slab climb up to the top on easy terrain which can be wet if it has rained recently.    I hope this topo information is helpful to all that use this site.

Nuclear Erection,112803655,Trad,106523674,5.12d,114,1,4.0,1.0,"A brilliant and direct line on perfect stone. Nuclear Erection is a masterpiece in tenuous and technical climbing. Although rated 12d, you may find it more difficult and not as straightforward as some of the 13a pitches on the North Side. The Selected Climbs in NC guidebook breaks this into 2 pitches.....utilizing a hanging gear belay halfway up. It's worth noting however that Shull and the other folks that have sent this route, linked both pitches. The guidebook also calls Pitch 1 12b and Pitch 2 12d....although I find that the crux is around bolts 4 & 5 on P1. I believe that this route has only seen 3 free ascents to date, and maybe only 1 proper red-point.  The first 3 bolts involve fun and athletic moves that dance around the arete. Get to a stance on the face, and get ready for a good stretch of hard climbing. Bolts, pins, and cams in horizontals will get you to another shake/rest at a bomber hand crack below the upper bulges above. The upper part of the route is steeper and bouldery....although there are some rest stances to be had along the way. Expect long reaches to poor slopers, high stepping, and wild undercling sequences. The boulder problem before the anchor might just be your redpoint crux. You can rappel from here with a single 70m rope, it just reaches the ground/slab.",{106775653: 4}

Hyperbola,105900646,Trad,106523709,5.10a,550,4,3.8,40.0,"This was one of my favorite routes, for the grade, at the Glass. It was originally called Five Easy Pieces by the first ascent party that did it as an aid climb. Sometime afterwards we started calling the route  Hyperbola and the name stuck.     My recollection of this route is it has a very hairy first pitch that involves some thin, hairball, 5.9 Carolina slab climbing where a fall would not be good for the leader, to reach the base of the arch. To start the route you climb up on some large flakes that are below & to the left of the arch. The tricky slab climbing starts off of the flakes and heads up & right to the base of the arch crack system. Since the first ascent, a harder, but better-protected direct start has been added. Getting thru the hairy slab climbing is the psycological crux of this route.  A rest can be had afterwards at the base the crack system. Here the leader can rest & recoup for the pumpy technical crux under cling & pull-over move to reach the beautiful arching dihedral finger crack. Be sure your pro is set good before heading up here.     On one memorable ascent, a good friend of mine, was launching out on this move when his pro pulled out while in the middle of the crux pull over. Cams were not on the market at that time and he had only placed this one hex to protect the undercling. This left nothing but the bolt on the slab as his last protection and he was caught looking at a potential 50-plus-foot ground fall. He looked down at me, trimbeling, wild eyed, like a deer caught in the headlights!! I shouted out my encouragement and sent up all the positive energy I could thru the rope that ran between us.  Shaking, scraping, and breathing like a locomotive he managed to barely pull over the crux move!! ""Are you alright Peter!!??"" I called up. After a quite a few minutes, where I think he was digesting seeing his whole life flash before his eyes, he replied ""Yea!"" He finally regained his composure and, like the true hard man he was, finished up the rest of arch.    Most folks will rap from the top of the arch, but there are 2-3 more pitches to finish the route to the top. Second pitch being around 5.9 with one, guide book says two bolts, but I only remeber placing one  for pro and the crux moves would be getting off the top of the arch. The third & fourth pitches follow an indistinct line and are probably 5.7-5.8.

Sensemilia Sunset,105941668,Trad,106523709,5.9+,465,4,2.7,19.0,"On one of my first trips to Looking Glass sans guide book and inexperienced with runout slab climbing, I ran into a local who recommended this new route as a good 5.9. It was the perfect sandbag and quite memorable.   Begin about 50 yards to the right of Sundial Crack. The first 50-60 feet is a sea of unprotectable eyebrows (~5.8) ending on a ledge. I would recommend belaying here but didn't the first time I climbed it resulting in some serious rope drag. Pull over an easy, well protected bulge above the ledge. Veer to the right and follow the path of least resistance to a crack which takes good gear. From the crack, head back slightly left and up towards the anchors. As I recall the last 20 feet is pretty hairy unprotected climbing that left me feeling nauseous. I went for it and to my relief found an unusual ""thank god"" hold just below the anchors that wasn't visible from below. If you are not a well seasoned Looking Glass slabmaster, I would not recommend this as a first 5.9...or even a second or third for that matter!   Addendum:    Per the guide book the route continues on for another 3 pitches:   P2: 5.9+, 150 ft with a bolted anchor    P3: 5.7, 150 ft also bolted anchor   P4: 5.5, 165 ft; descend as for the nose","{105833953: 4, 106633305: 4, 107768941: 3, 106904776: 3, 112151630: 3, 105907433: 3, 106792700: 3, 106449553: 3, 200320340: 3, 106300559: 3, 106575966: 3, 108226515: 3, 106873063: 2, 107034760: 2, 108402770: 2, 106372148: 2, 105979386: 2, 106056907: 2, 10743: 2}"

The crack actually runs for only ~20 ft on the 3rd pitch and is flaring, but protectable. The Lambert/Shull guide rates it 5.8, but I thought it was really mellow for the grade.    This description is meant to supplement the Lambert/Shull book. Ratings are from the book.    Start: Pretty much where the approach trail meets the rock. Relatively short approach.    P1: 5.5 80' Climb up and stay right of bulge, then move left to anchors. Either this pitch is underrated or the next pitch is overrated, as they didn't feel that different in difficulty.    P2. 5.8 100' At start, look up & right to anchors at top of 2nd pitch. Aim for those. Plenty of gear options.    P3: 5.7 120' If climbing on 50m ropes, climb more than 120' to ensure enough rope for last pitch. There are no fixed anchors for the end of this pitch.

This is probably one of the easier routes on this wall to start out on.      P1:  The Shull/Lambert topo shows a gradual rightward rising traverse to get to the crack.  Don't do this.  From the rack-up spot below Prey traverse straight right on a 3rd class slab until you are directly below the crack, then go straight up on eyebrows.  You'll have to make a couple committing slab moves with gear at your feet, but you shouldn't hit the slab if you fall.  If it seems dangerous, you're in the wrong spot.

P3:  Traverse left back to the crack from the belay.  Do a hard high-step/layback to get back in the crack (harder for short folks)...this was a little scary with gear at your feet and a slab below.

""Titties and Beer"" is an example of this. The Shull/Lambert guide reports Randy Mann was on the FA of this route when it was actually Ted Anderson who was on the FA. It is important to recognize Ted as the name for this route was inspired by Ted and comes from a Zappa song. Ted Anderson is a huge Zappa fan and we listened to a lot of Zappa when enroute to our ""many"" climbing adventures together.  We were also, of course, big fans of the objects of this song...     After we did the first ascent & named it Titties & Beer this route got dubbed ""the world's hardest 5.8"". The story behind that is after we did the first ascent we were telling Jeep Gaskin, Grover Cable & some other friends about the new route. They asked us how hard we thought the route was. We thought about it and it seemed pretty easy compared to some of the scarefests we had done & were doing on the Glass and elsewhere and we also thought 5.10 was about the hardest we could climb back then. So off the cuff I said ""Oh, it's probably  about 5.8."" Future ascents later confirmed that I might have had understated the rating a bit. Hence it became dubbed ""The worlds hardest 5.8""  Goes to show its always good to have a concensus on ratings.... The 5.8 climber might need a beer or two after climbing the sensational, voluptuous, undulations on this route.     Regardless of the original stated rating, for its grade it is a very cool route with a lot of character for a Looking Glass climb. We originally did the route by starting from the left on the upper slab and traversing to underneath the prominent crack system where we placed a bolt and belayed. We also later added a 10+ or 11- R/X direct start that we toproped at first and I led at one point. This variation climbed direct up a step slab off the ground with little or no pro to below the belay below the crack. The route has some hard moves to gain the crack and that is what I thought was the crux on the FA. Continue on up the crack and belay near the top. From there move out left a bit to find a spot where you can move thru the bulges and start trending right and then up. It has been a long time since I have done the route but follow the natural line to the top.

Power up the corner (crux) on laybacks and the occasional jam, and on to the top.","{105936209: 4, 107556942: 4, 107442586: 4, 107574703: 4, 105802830: 4, 105904878: 4, 107582522: 4, 107545559: 4, 105802480: 4, 106019888: 4, 13937: 4, 106056907: 4, 107626197: 4, 107724277: 4, 107552239: 4, 106098470: 4, 12084: 4, 106038528: 4, 106552384: 4, 106670468: 4, 106777584: 4, 106427485: 4, 106900293: 4, 106268527: 4, 107034760: 4, 106064884: 4, 107138006: 4, 107186479: 4, 106464390: 4, 106887229: 4, 106933264: 4, 106741672: 4, 107384266: 4, 106325770: 4, 106510314: 4, 107470838: 4, 105964643: 4, 105805825: 4, 107729640: 4, 106538248: 4, 107465641: 4, 106590161: 4, 106980350: 4, 107989551: 4, 107050213: 4, 106901183: 4, 106386525: 4, 107494770: 4, 106389733: 4, 108372237: 4, 105833953: 4, 107362148: 4, 107481504: 4, 108083183: 4, 107960452: 4, 108121087: 4, 107361547: 4, 108307718: 4, 107769068: 4, 109416636: 4, 105896358: 4, 109043313: 4, 108308307: 4, 109383300: 4, 109512184: 4, 109633459: 4, 107219464: 4, 105833163: 4, 110096299: 4, 108119334: 4, 109162287: 4, 107324126: 4, 109316466: 4, 108401191: 4, 109765597: 4, 111886470: 4, 108718600: 4, 110797288: 4, 12023: 4, 109113775: 4, 109488917: 4, 107743173: 4, 109293680: 4, 108105844: 4, 110434481: 4, 106452833: 4, 111733522: 4, 106951875: 4, 108518318: 4, 112502251: 4, 107081000: 4, 109077806: 4, 106820629: 4, 113581879: 4, 106873063: 4, 200129124: 4, 200182883: 4, 200334818: 4, 106298371: 4, 200160322: 4, 111151975: 4, 108088813: 4, 113448572: 4, 200064207: 4, 200180731: 4, 108370856: 4, 200414553: 4, 110045225: 4, 111334223: 4, 200043076: 4, 112208653: 4, 108273822: 4, 106596992: 4, 108815591: 4, 108170319: 4, 109097212: 4, 112846784: 4, 200230519: 4, 108732554: 4, 110682222: 4, 200393914: 4, 200718126: 4, 111416155: 4, 200385661: 4, 200387204: 4, 200209902: 4, 112254411: 4, 200385488: 4, 106565649: 3, 106767428: 3, 107340553: 3, 105886712: 3, 107671600: 3, 107700510: 3, 105930639: 3, 105979386: 3, 107504797: 3, 107661795: 3, 106418002: 3, 106449553: 3, 106488744: 3, 106720671: 3, 107343989: 3, 106792700: 3, 106372148: 3, 106314584: 3, 107065961: 3, 106994750: 3, 106712274: 3, 106888178: 3, 106756614: 3, 106919775: 3, 107472859: 3, 107223178: 3, 106995187: 3, 107051650: 3, 106816785: 3, 108659936: 3, 105967115: 3, 107768941: 3, 109033024: 3, 106794436: 3, 109601382: 3, 107696304: 3, 107297633: 3, 108686410: 3, 108661995: 3, 109767025: 3, 108220502: 3, 107540372: 3, 106662918: 3, 107956359: 3, 108270652: 3, 109749751: 3, 14213: 3, 106506554: 3, 108402770: 3, 108330151: 3, 111801409: 3, 108476315: 3, 106536240: 3, 112151630: 3, 106045498: 3, 108138324: 3, 112104441: 3, 106788819: 3, 111060268: 3, 200122090: 3, 110575679: 3, 107691833: 3, 111360319: 3, 112163760: 3, 109151172: 3, 107563513: 3, 113187400: 3, 200440173: 3, 112151773: 3, 107410579: 3, 109316126: 3, 200241195: 3, 106379670: 2, 106271347: 2, 106272278: 2, 106949968: 2, 107589858: 2, 107744773: 2, 111806823: 2, 200360582: 2}"

It's almost three climbs in one:  crack climbing; chimney; and face climbing.  Many people skip the second pitch, but it's lots of fun and very worthwhile.    P1 - Start at a somewhat steep crack, working your way up with jams and some face holds.  The going quickly gets easier/less steep, continue past some flake moves to the base of a chimney with bolted belay anchors (80').    P2 - Climb the chimney (well-protected), continuing until it begins to narrow, then make balancy moves out onto the face to the left.  Continue up the low-angled face to the top (80').","{106956627: 4, 107606573: 4, 107442586: 4, 105886712: 4, 105798243: 4, 107574703: 4, 105904878: 4, 107582522: 4, 107700510: 4, 105930639: 4, 105802480: 4, 107504797: 4, 106386525: 4, 106192953: 4, 105979386: 4, 106038528: 4, 107552239: 4, 106984652: 4, 106319993: 4, 106449553: 4, 106552384: 4, 106488744: 4, 106488817: 4, 106670468: 4, 106708893: 4, 106944348: 4, 106961798: 4, 106904274: 4, 107034760: 4, 106655109: 4, 106064884: 4, 107138006: 4, 107293347: 4, 106941307: 4, 106464390: 4, 106879805: 4, 106741672: 4, 106887229: 4, 107299135: 4, 107384266: 4, 107362148: 4, 106919775: 4, 107417154: 4, 107470838: 4, 106510314: 4, 107479192: 4, 107729640: 4, 107753484: 4, 106538248: 4, 107465641: 4, 106980350: 4, 108124323: 4, 107775726: 4, 107050213: 4, 107636562: 4, 106816785: 4, 106077771: 4, 106901183: 4, 108307718: 4, 108659936: 4, 108065407: 4, 107159816: 4, 107494770: 4, 109316466: 4, 105833953: 4, 108151878: 4, 108323748: 4, 107960452: 4, 107540372: 4, 108121087: 4, 108083183: 4, 109749751: 4, 109416636: 4, 108300713: 4, 107361547: 4, 108048987: 4, 106022427: 4, 108144148: 4, 108270652: 4, 108104464: 4, 110642198: 4, 109348209: 4, 107324126: 4, 109043313: 4, 109383300: 4, 110236104: 4, 110575679: 4, 107734618: 4, 107219464: 4, 109448507: 4, 106506554: 4, 105833163: 4, 107297115: 4, 111790203: 4, 107547633: 4, 111801409: 4, 108476315: 4, 107744773: 4, 109679606: 4, 111967537: 4, 109668894: 4, 112151630: 4, 108404199: 4, 111757235: 4, 111746326: 4, 109490709: 4, 109187861: 4, 12023: 4, 109155979: 4, 111823469: 4, 109980871: 4, 109488917: 4, 109293680: 4, 112104441: 4, 111722665: 4, 108800901: 4, 112384358: 4, 109127832: 4, 200101473: 4, 112320574: 4, 106452833: 4, 110374930: 4, 200122090: 4, 200180684: 4, 111984657: 4, 108518318: 4, 112378935: 4, 112502251: 4, 111733522: 4, 111151975: 4, 110323884: 4, 112254411: 4, 107460666: 4, 111770859: 4, 200309259: 4, 113581879: 4, 106873063: 4, 112161641: 4, 108815591: 4, 200387204: 4, 200181469: 4, 200334818: 4, 200160322: 4, 200064207: 4, 200408299: 4, 200349077: 4, 200414553: 4, 200354363: 4, 113187400: 4, 200434751: 4, 200100133: 4, 112244217: 4, 111334223: 4, 200440173: 4, 106967794: 4, 200385488: 4, 200480741: 4, 108273822: 4, 200089239: 4, 106596992: 4, 200129124: 4, 200143564: 4, 112151773: 4, 112846784: 4, 200403176: 4, 200657424: 4, 110682222: 4, 200128787: 4, 200566967: 4, 107410579: 4, 109097212: 4, 200718126: 4, 111504934: 4, 200453531: 4, 200747167: 4, 200385661: 4, 200229728: 4, 200472347: 4, 200360582: 4, 200130766: 4, 107520550: 3, 107556942: 3, 106767428: 3, 105936209: 3, 107589858: 3, 107186479: 3, 107340553: 3, 107671600: 3, 105802830: 3, 107545559: 3, 106019888: 3, 13937: 3, 106056907: 3, 106098470: 3, 106756614: 3, 107435282: 3, 107626197: 3, 106222196: 3, 107089682: 3, 107661795: 3, 106398872: 3, 106507582: 3, 106565649: 3, 106663775: 3, 106452603: 3, 106777584: 3, 106359631: 3, 106792700: 3, 106379670: 3, 106372148: 3, 106870556: 3, 106770679: 3, 106936547: 3, 106900293: 3, 106268527: 3, 107065961: 3, 107223178: 3, 106933264: 3, 106712274: 3, 107261990: 3, 106325770: 3, 105964643: 3, 106394111: 3, 106590161: 3, 108152984: 3, 106989253: 3, 108126116: 3, 107290177: 3, 107482468: 3, 107989551: 3, 107462886: 3, 107051650: 3, 108093105: 3, 107978046: 3, 107686628: 3, 108618059: 3, 107861772: 3, 105967115: 3, 108686410: 3, 106389733: 3, 105972853: 3, 106560164: 3, 107943592: 3, 109151883: 3, 107929155: 3, 109033024: 3, 106794436: 3, 107481504: 3, 108199044: 3, 108170319: 3, 108856175: 3, 109162287: 3, 107608804: 3, 108661995: 3, 106405973: 3, 107956359: 3, 107769068: 3, 109585706: 3, 111212017: 3, 109633459: 3, 108402770: 3, 14213: 3, 110797288: 3, 108308307: 3, 110096299: 3, 107632893: 3, 108401191: 3, 111777337: 3, 110744057: 3, 109765597: 3, 106536240: 3, 106045498: 3, 111886470: 3, 111486620: 3, 108253198: 3, 111598962: 3, 109113775: 3, 108335276: 3, 108138324: 3, 112568421: 3, 111724716: 3, 106788819: 3, 108105844: 3, 105896358: 3, 200043076: 3, 110434481: 3, 110642863: 3, 107691833: 3, 111360319: 3, 113164188: 3, 200086061: 3, 200162986: 3, 107081000: 3, 110531724: 3, 109834877: 3, 110488065: 3, 107656938: 3, 200320340: 3, 108212790: 3, 106095990: 3, 109151172: 3, 112163760: 3, 200049395: 3, 107134757: 3, 108088813: 3, 107563513: 3, 200434628: 3, 112208653: 3, 108119334: 3, 110538349: 3, 200550015: 3, 200367280: 3, 110053057: 3, 110151632: 3, 111903483: 3, 110306301: 3, 111416155: 3, 200393914: 3, 12084: 3, 105790206: 3, 109316126: 3, 107472859: 2, 106271347: 2, 106300559: 2, 106720671: 2, 107343989: 2, 106994750: 2, 106427485: 2, 107341884: 2, 107743165: 2, 107768941: 2, 107590557: 2, 107224111: 2, 109767025: 2, 108220502: 2, 106662918: 2, 111806823: 2, 112396583: 2, 200241195: 2}"

Both Gunboat Diplomacy and Seven Year Itch are great routes, so this makes the entire endeavor a pretty fun 4-5 pitch romp up Rumbling Bald.    Pitch 1-2: Climb Gunboat Diplomacy or 7 Year Itch. Or I reckon you could climb Scream Like a Boy, Silent Treatment, or Flakeview, though those routes are all somewhat scary. Continue past the rap rings at the top of 7 Year Itch to a big pine ledge with a big flake system to the right (PIllar of Faith 5.7) and a hand crack in a right facing corner to the left. FFoF starts in the hand crack on the left.    Pitch 3 (5.7, 150'): Climb the 20' hand crack until it widens into an open book/chimney. Continue to the top of this and then onto the top of some big broken blocks to the left. From here climb easy, low angle terrain to a double bolt anchor at a big sloping ledge. Alternately, after the corner, you can also go out right on a ledge and awkwardly mantle a bulge to easy, dirty, runout 5.3 terrain before going back left to the anchor.    Pitch 4 (5.10-, 100'): Move just left of the anchor to incut holds on a steep face off the ledge (5.9) leading to a crack 15' up that angles to the right. The holds are nicely incut, but don't blow it before getting to the crack. Traverse right along the crack (5.9) until it peters out into low angle moves taking you up to a bolt. Clip the bolt and climb through a section of low 5.10 edging to another big belay ledge with a bolted anchor to the left.    Pitch 5: Apparently you can move out right of the belay anchor around the overhanging stuff above you to a short (40') 5.7 section. But directly above the belay is a very short boulder problem (5.10) with good gear leading to the trees. I think most people skip this pitch.    Descent: If you do the 5th pitch, make a short rap off a tree to the anchor of pitch 4. Then a 100' rap puts you at the anchor of pitch 3. From there, a 150' rap puts you either at a big tree above Seven Year Itch or the Seven Year Itch rap rings. A 160' rap from the tree or rings atop Seven Year Itch puts you on the ground.","{108815591: 3, 106045498: 2, 108686410: 1}"

It is imperative to get the good medium sized stopper and TCU placements here for the crux move.  Once you got the gear, make the very difficult lie-back sort of move to get to the good hands again.

The Radical Left,116782745,Trad,105945074,5.12a,120,1,4.0,1.0,"The Route    A radical (If I may say so) new line at Lakeview. Probably the best line at the crag, unless you prefer slab climbing, then you will like the other routes. Steep, featured, and by virtue of being the exposed section of the arete, the rock is very clean with great texture. This route initially started as an alternate finish to the route Left Unlocked and was bolted ground up. An anchor was later added to allow lower off with a 70 (barely! Tie knots in the end of your rope) and a direct start was discovered which was bolted on rappel. Although Left Unlocked is badass, probably the best way to do this route is via the direct start as described herein. The route begins in the dirty corner to the left of the arete. Place good gear through about 40 feet of the crack. There is a bomber .75 camelot just before the traverse right toward the bolts on the face (double length sling recommended on the cam).  After traversing right from the crack, gingerly mantle on top of a hollow flake (don’t kill your belayer). Clip a bolt and make moves on crimps and jugs and a nice hueco-like sidepull past two more bolts on a slightly overhanging face. A long move to a jug awaits just before mantling to a no hands rest where you can clip the 4th bolt.    Make some fun balancy face moves with a thumbdercling or two to a good meat hook sidepull where you can clip the bolt above the small roof. Begin the bouldery crux section involving slopers, sidepulls, and maybe some other tricks. Once past the crux and holding a good ledge hold, figure out how to get stood up on it, without Weekend Whippering yourself (youtube.com/watch?v=Yl8wJtM…). Finally, move left to the beautiful arcing rail feature, clip another bolt, mantle the rail and make one final red-point crux slab move before reaching the anchors…You can also top out through 5.7 R terrain for a slightly better view at the anchors for Left Unlocked and belay from gear or the bolt anchor (double rope rappel if you top out).   The Name  It was important that we one up Mikey Williams by naming the route with a quadruple entendre! Unfortunately, we failed to beat the legend. We did manage the triple, courtesy of my friend Ben (who had a lot of good suggestions, including Adam Areteondra). The triple goes like this: First, the route is left of Left Unlocked. It is also clearly radical. Finally, it was put up using radical left principles. An endangered fauna and flora assessment was performed. We didn’t find anything except for a couple baby seals, which were clubbed in accordance with the Clean Water Act. The route was approved by the Klub for Parity in Outdoor Participation which found the route to be of similar difficulty for all genders and races, and one member saying that it does in fact bring her joy. The route was initially bolted ground up as required by K-POP, but later a direct start was rap bolted, just to stick it to the man. Some grass was pulled out of the vegetated corner to clean it up, but the environmental impact was offset by planting some kudzu. Oh yeah, some of the hangers were also recycled from Hidden Valley bolt replacement (this part is actually true). Next season we are going to put up the Radical Right at the other end of the cliff. Not only will the bolts be drilled, they will also be fracked. You will have to show ID to climb it, and even though the route is a lying, narcistic, authoritarian piece of crap, you will climb it anyway.",{109010613: 4}

Crux5.7-5.8   Pitch 3 is 3 progressive overhangs with great rest points - Crux5.8   Pitch 4 is friction - Crux5.8   Pitch 5 starts with a 15ft crack to a water groove and then huge ledge - Crux5.8   Pitch 6 starts with a overhang off the ledge and then follows a water groove with face climbing, ending with another overhang and face climbing. - Crux5.8    The crux of the route is about halfway into the route transitioning from the lower face to the upper face.  The 4th pitch has a traverse with little pro (at least back in the 80's).  I would assume by now that some bolts have been added to key areas of the route.  The entire route was originally done with sparse pro, sparse bolts, tricams and stoppers.

A friend mentions starting to the right under the roof and traversing out left to the route. I didn’t know this route existed to begin with and started directly under vertical crack and pulled through an overlap to reach the crack.

The Great Ah Ha,108415131,Trad,105965579,5.12b,750,8,2.5,2.0,"A good route to do after you have done all the trademark headwall routes.  Overall a little chossier than Vol Wall and more run out than the Matrix.  Never though did I feel like I would pull off blocks the size of my chest like I did on Vol Wall.  Just a constant rain of pebbles and foot chips down on the belayer.  Definitely though has some of the hardest manditory free climbing I have experienced yet out there.  No simple aid tricks to get you through some of the committing 5.11 climbing.  If you want some more adventure at Whitesides (like there isn't enough already) this is the route to get on.    The first 3 anchors had massive tatapuses on them with 2 rap rings each, its at least 10 years old.  Some one should go up there with a knife and cut it down.  In case you have no common sense, DON'T USE IT.    The following information is to be used along side the guidebook description:   Pitch 1) Bring the #4, slings, C3s, and big balls up this pitch.  Starts with easy and protect climbing.  This climbing quickly turns to 5.9 R while in the act of pulling the corner.  (I believe the grass has grown in the unflaired crack, leaving only really failed crack.  I jabbed a .5 in the least flaired spot but it wouldn't of done much good.)  After that sack up and enter the 5.7 X traverse zone.  You will quickly see why.  Finally, a blind yellow C3 placed at your feet lets you stop feeling like you are gonna vomit.  Don't be a dummy, put a sling on it and the next bolt.  The crux can be french freed with a red c3 if you feel so inclined.    Pitch 2) Find the best way off the belay so that you don't land on your belayer or throw hollow flakes at him. I think we placed a nut on this pitch.    Pitch 3) The marathon pitch.  Lots of gear in the first 30 and last 30 feet, two bolts in the middle section, but the hardest move is protected.  180 feet total climbing on this pitch, you do the math on the runouts.  Lots of route finding.    Pitch 4) Awesome exposure with mandatory and committing 5.11 climbing.    Pitch 5) Short pitch but it packs a punch.  I would rate it 11D A0.  We had a trecking pole in the bag that we used as a stick clip and pulled through the crux with that.  Its a stupid hard boulder problem and everytime you blow it you either kick your belayer or land on him.  Note that the rotten band for Vol Wall runs through this pitch as well.  Probably the coolest move of the route though guards the anchors.    Pitch 6) The guidebook description is pretty accurate, ""dicey"" it is.  Bring the 4 up this pitch as well.    Pitch 7)  3 seperate cruxes, the second being the hardest but all pretty much the same move.  Last one is over gear, so bring some.  Each crux gets dirtier and mossier as you go.  The traverse at the end can be protected with gear.  Its is however, buried under an inch of licken.    Pitch 8) Same last pitch for vol wall and arm and hammer.

Bolder Problem in Space (free),112259891,Trad,106912371,5.11+,190,2,4.0,2.0,"Bolder Problem in Space was originally done at A4 by Forrest Gardner and Todd Wells. It is an intense aid route with few to no repeats. With FA permission, a free variation was added on lead. The original route aided out a roof crack, whereas the new free variation continues traversing right to the prow. Expect insane exposure and some tough bouldering on great edges.    Climb Boulder Problem in the Sky's first pitch and belay at the bolted anchor. Move straight up off of the belay and climb the first 25' of Bat Shit Crazy (10+). At the roof, instead of traversing left like all of the other climbs, traverse right. Be sure to extend the gear at the beginning of the climb. Move out right past some good gear to get to some good edges and the first bolt. Clip the first bolt and make a technical sequence to reach better edges (11). Continue traversing to a large stance and the second bolt. A little further right and you reach a blunt prow that takes natural pro. Follow the prow until the end. From here, the final boulder problem begins. Make a hard move right and clip the bolt at a decent stance. Blast straight up until you reach the good finger rail and ride it right to the end (11+). Make one last tough move to exit onto the slab above.    Note: Bolts 1 and 3 can be cleaned by the follower after completing most of the hard sequences. This will prevent large pendulums due to the traversing nature of the route. If you or your second is not comfortable at the grade, it will help to have some prussik or ascenders. Any falls not next to gear will be into space. Lowering off in the middle of the climb is not advised since the rope may not reach the ledge or ground below. At the last bolt, you can clip the trail rope into the draw. Then if you fall, you can use the trail rope as aid to get back to the bolt. This will prevent needing rope ascending gear for the leader.","{106449553: 4, 106092467: 4}"

Variation: Move out left from the belay at some thin cracks and climb through a short chimney to join up with the last part of the mossy slab (5.5).","{106056907: 4, 107277859: 4, 107606573: 4, 105898716: 4, 107671600: 4, 105904878: 4, 106816785: 4, 105930639: 4, 107051524: 4, 106410370: 4, 106452833: 4, 106098470: 4, 107661795: 4, 106299702: 4, 106030214: 4, 106441036: 4, 105894739: 4, 106068243: 4, 106449553: 4, 106415391: 4, 106817307: 4, 106116879: 4, 106887229: 4, 107081416: 4, 106968845: 4, 105964643: 4, 106741672: 4, 107494770: 4, 106538248: 4, 107729640: 4, 106901183: 4, 107361547: 4, 107148964: 4, 106919775: 4, 107775726: 4, 107940453: 4, 107223178: 4, 108139500: 4, 108312506: 4, 107051650: 4, 105833953: 4, 108155370: 4, 106377758: 4, 109535352: 4, 107590557: 4, 108320578: 4, 106756614: 4, 108376511: 4, 107481504: 4, 107608804: 4, 108370856: 4, 109841901: 4, 107960452: 4, 107074538: 4, 107958782: 4, 109383300: 4, 105833163: 4, 110306301: 4, 110652445: 4, 108426958: 4, 108632744: 4, 109058226: 4, 111815172: 4, 110054827: 4, 112151630: 4, 112118026: 4, 112274548: 4, 107016978: 4, 111757235: 4, 110176409: 4, 112104441: 4, 109113775: 4, 109187861: 4, 108405421: 4, 107032446: 4, 109284031: 4, 112003885: 4, 111944305: 4, 107033657: 4, 111504934: 4, 111212017: 4, 200090783: 4, 112285586: 4, 200040300: 4, 106873063: 4, 113453662: 4, 107131979: 4, 200084197: 4, 112502251: 4, 106045498: 4, 111806823: 4, 200226766: 4, 200178468: 4, 109325110: 4, 112415495: 4, 200094615: 4, 200211168: 4, 200211565: 4, 109378372: 4, 200236608: 4, 108815591: 4, 200007735: 4, 112187148: 4, 200064096: 4, 106095990: 4, 112359946: 4, 200065675: 4, 200181469: 4, 107083075: 4, 200187500: 4, 111951594: 4, 200427805: 4, 107395651: 4, 107423457: 4, 111203516: 4, 111380201: 4, 107563513: 4, 111277008: 4, 112049177: 4, 111239574: 4, 200546386: 4, 112468813: 4, 110736595: 4, 200129124: 4, 112349543: 4, 110327172: 4, 200143564: 4, 200557621: 4, 200089239: 4, 200616950: 4, 110262051: 4, 112154993: 4, 200224245: 4, 200715811: 4, 12084: 4, 200446866: 4, 107539169: 4, 113187675: 4, 107288223: 3, 107490919: 3, 105979386: 3, 105854062: 3, 107453284: 3, 105841087: 3, 106222196: 3, 106243972: 3, 106898836: 3, 106300559: 3, 106372148: 3, 106472037: 3, 106482105: 3, 106327975: 3, 106712274: 3, 106941307: 3, 105912413: 3, 106329936: 3, 106684313: 3, 107050213: 3, 106744745: 3, 106944348: 3, 105860008: 3, 106915043: 3, 106870556: 3, 106633305: 3, 107034760: 3, 107228342: 3, 106990190: 3, 107599789: 3, 108093105: 3, 106077771: 3, 106805249: 3, 106967373: 3, 105787467: 3, 107224041: 3, 107635727: 3, 106720671: 3, 107290177: 3, 106389733: 3, 107219020: 3, 108512198: 3, 108659936: 3, 107540372: 3, 109316466: 3, 109977730: 3, 108398129: 3, 109633459: 3, 108307718: 3, 110353558: 3, 109293680: 3, 108119334: 3, 108297950: 3, 107555213: 3, 107860997: 3, 108856175: 3, 110411445: 3, 110301942: 3, 108402770: 3, 108268000: 3, 107547633: 3, 107324126: 3, 110450478: 3, 109712255: 3, 107768941: 3, 110744057: 3, 107232016: 3, 108088813: 3, 109077806: 3, 111660364: 3, 109765597: 3, 112124233: 3, 111886470: 3, 108083183: 3, 107632893: 3, 111941074: 3, 109606781: 3, 111795422: 3, 111520764: 3, 108105844: 3, 109932423: 3, 108805878: 3, 112220235: 3, 110998676: 3, 112438476: 3, 107081000: 3, 200043076: 3, 107769068: 3, 109409153: 3, 109279277: 3, 108220692: 3, 108977895: 3, 108357742: 3, 200455940: 3, 200180731: 3, 110770284: 3, 200197297: 3, 200068081: 3, 200619052: 3, 107933029: 3, 200241195: 3, 7091677: 3, 107298720: 2, 107940574: 2, 107504797: 2, 106534265: 2, 106792700: 2, 107384266: 2, 105949171: 2, 107861772: 2, 107462886: 2, 107748560: 2, 109151883: 2, 107124738: 2, 108270652: 2, 108171791: 2, 108036454: 2, 106079052: 2, 107850573: 1, 107380951: 1}"

Ted Anderson  and I did it as a finish to the Hawks Bill  traverse around 1979. It was never really documented in the local guide books. However,  when checking these out I  am guessing this may be the same route that was later called Campbell Crack and claimed as a FA by Doug Reed and Tommy Howard 1983, several years after Ted and I did it. However without having been there in many years I am not certain of that. The description of that climb sounds similar as well as the location given in the topo diagram of Selected Cilmbs in North Carolina and Thomas Kelly's guide to N.C..    Anegada is mentioned in the back of Thomas Kelly's guidebook but I remember him saying he wasn't sure where it was when he wrote that guide so he didn't add it to his diagram of the cliff. As I recall it is a high quality finish and a burly 5.10...    The name comes from a passage in the  Caribbean  between the British Virgin Islands and Anguilla .  Notoriously called the OH-MY-GOD-A (Anegada) Passage. Its a straight in the Caribbean with some depths reaching more than 6,000 feet. Crazy currents flow through from the Atlantic as they feed into the Caribbean Sea and its not uncommon for waves to be slamming against the hull from three different directions.I had a very memorable, wild and rough crossing on that passage in a severe storm with my dad in a sailboat one time . It was a wild experience and therefore an inspirational name for this wild climb.    Anegada Passage is a strait in the Caribbean, at 18°22′41″N 63°50′15″W﻿ / ﻿18.377986°N 63.837433°W. It separates the British Virgin Islands and the British ruled Sombrero Island of Anguilla.    Tom Howard wrote:    Bob is correct. I always thought that Anegada Passage was a cool 20' horizontal flake crack on the top of Hawks Bill. He described Campbell Crack perfectly.

Linville Crusher,112248480,Trad,112248464,5.10-,0,19,4.0,9.0,"The Linville Crusher (aka Linville Link Up) is typically described as climbing 6 different routes on 6 distinct formations on the east side of Linville Gorge in a day, hiking/jogging between climbs. The majority of climbers do it north to south, as it's a net elevation loss in that direction. Most folks stash a car at Shortoff and then park at Sitting Bear to start, though a few teams have started at Gingercake Mountain.  The formations and their most commonly done routes are:  Sitting Bear: Original Route (5.9+) Hawksbill: Lost in Space to Star Trekkin (5.9) or Lost in Space (5.10) Table Rock: North Ridge (5.5) or Cave Route (5.5) NC Wall: Bumblebee Buttress (5.8) Mummy Buttress: Daddy or Mummy (5.5) Shortoff: Maginot Line (5.7), Paradise Alley (5.9), or Little Corner (5.6)  In the spring and summer when peregrines are nesting, Bumblebee Buttress is closed, so many folks opt to climb either the Mummy or Daddy, and then the Prow (5.4). That's sorta cheating as it makes for a MUCH easier/shorter day, and Apricot Jam (5.10) doesn't close. But whatever: have fun doing it however you like.  I'd also argue that caches are cheating, but if one were inclined to cache some gear or food somewhere, the most logical place would be the Table Rock parking lot.  There may be water in the Amphitheater and then again in the Shortoff descent gully.  A goal for a lot of folks is 10 hours, though few can actually pull that off. 12 hours seems to be the going rate. Pat Goodman did it all solo with one car as an out and back, up and down climbing routes up to 5.11 for 32 pitches and 23 miles in 11:23 car to car.  Lots of folks do this to see how fast they can do it. As the crux of the Crusher is hiking, anyone reporting a time for the Crusher should report car to car times and not, say, their base-of-Sitting-Bear-to-topping-out-Shortoff time. You should also report whether caches were used, any porter support from other folks, whether you did it with one car or two, and whether you did the easy version that includes The Prow.","{106045498: 4, 109058226: 4, 106901183: 4, 106582504: 4, 111886470: 4, 107085870: 4, 107051650: 4, 106058175: 4, 105823960: 4}"

It was less windy at the base so we did a quick lead up the rappel line which put us on top of the first buttress (per the Select Guide). The wind picked up even more but rather than completely bag it and just hike up and out the gully we opted to check out the licheny easy 5th class face to the right of Dopey Duck and Dizzy Gillespie.     This path followed an arete on the rightmost side of the big wall starting with a fun easy overhang (5.4?) to get underway and follows a up through a series of juggy but dubious strength plates and assorted choss (be wary). Topped out a first pitch by belaying at a tree on the left side of this feature, about 100' up not long after it slabs off. From here our second pitch continued up easy terrain until we could surmount another imposing but easy juggy choss roof (with terrific wind).

It can be easily approached by rapping in from the large ledge just below the top of the buttress (instead of doing the step-across move last pitch, climb down about 15' to large ledge, build anchor and rap 90').    Alternatively, it can be accessed by climbing P-1 of ""stopperhead arete"" or ""lichen express"", then moving into the gully to the obvious route on the steep left wall.

It will be marked by a large pine at the base and another pine about 20 feet up the route.  This route can be done in 3 or 4 pitches. P1 - Climb the dihedral to a belay below a chockstone.

P2 - Continue up the dihedral following the path of least resistance (this is the end of P1 if you brought a 70m), then angle right to an arete and up through a block/fingercrack to an overhang. Pull the overhang and set a belay on another great ledge. (or split this pitch into two.) P3 - Easy climbing up the dihedral leads to the top.  CAUTION: Stay left when pulling the ledge to belay station at the top of P2. There are loose boulders that from below seem bomber to pull on but from above are visibly about to fall.

Plug gear where you can and hooking body parts into the horizontals for rests. The pump starts ticking as soon as you pull on to it.

It is possible to combine pitches 2 and 3, but be careful about rope drag and communication.","{105912413: 4, 105904878: 4, 106068243: 4, 106140166: 4, 106478239: 4, 106713856: 4, 106527694: 4, 106913650: 4, 106816670: 4, 106870556: 4, 106741672: 4, 107346687: 4, 107405850: 4, 107494770: 4, 106901183: 4, 107223178: 4, 107290177: 4, 106077771: 4, 106961703: 4, 107940453: 4, 107074538: 4, 110985261: 4, 110979787: 4, 110323884: 4, 111894458: 4, 106912228: 4, 112151630: 4, 112203410: 4, 109155979: 4, 107016978: 4, 200048858: 4, 200058393: 4, 200106001: 4, 112415495: 4, 110535934: 4, 112401943: 4, 200226766: 4, 200224751: 4, 113581879: 4, 106477363: 4, 112187148: 4, 108212790: 4, 200181469: 4, 200431737: 4, 7007364: 4, 112349543: 4, 111504934: 4, 200384905: 4, 200873009: 4, 106467374: 3, 107051524: 3, 106410370: 3, 107605024: 3, 11387: 3, 106944348: 3, 107671600: 3, 105854062: 3, 107772498: 3, 107186479: 3, 106941307: 3, 106482105: 3, 106272278: 3, 106449553: 3, 106452603: 3, 106327975: 3, 106488744: 3, 106116879: 3, 106329936: 3, 106967373: 3, 107034760: 3, 106968845: 3, 107277859: 3, 107408896: 3, 106038528: 3, 107775726: 3, 106560164: 3, 107050213: 3, 107861772: 3, 107224041: 3, 106520944: 3, 107799943: 3, 107978046: 3, 106919775: 3, 106568500: 3, 107769068: 3, 107606573: 3, 108512198: 3, 109074314: 3, 109097506: 3, 109033024: 3, 109515378: 3, 109633459: 3, 107615085: 3, 107022803: 3, 105833953: 3, 107481504: 3, 110359430: 3, 110353558: 3, 108119334: 3, 109841901: 3, 108709053: 3, 107943592: 3, 109279277: 3, 107960452: 3, 108065407: 3, 107270055: 3, 108856175: 3, 110652445: 3, 109043313: 3, 110236104: 3, 111212017: 3, 110575679: 3, 105833163: 3, 110664729: 3, 110670751: 3, 109177228: 3, 111607851: 3, 106756614: 3, 110054827: 3, 109907430: 3, 109940623: 3, 107559644: 3, 111803330: 3, 111747281: 3, 107219076: 3, 108404199: 3, 112104441: 3, 107632893: 3, 110176409: 3, 111442903: 3, 111520764: 3, 109187861: 3, 111160230: 3, 112513275: 3, 107324126: 3, 107768941: 3, 109490709: 3, 112433726: 3, 109293680: 3, 111151975: 3, 112285586: 3, 200072147: 3, 109932423: 3, 200040300: 3, 109873901: 3, 110956309: 3, 112049177: 3, 200150490: 3, 110642863: 3, 111860789: 3, 105860008: 3, 109097212: 3, 112220235: 3, 111312458: 3, 200129124: 3, 200211168: 3, 200109224: 3, 200320340: 3, 200189643: 3, 7035557: 3, 200365582: 3, 200210379: 3, 200209902: 3, 200235059: 3, 111239574: 3, 112035468: 3, 107083075: 3, 111951594: 3, 200414553: 3, 107423457: 3, 111757235: 3, 200211147: 3, 112514908: 3, 109423338: 3, 200068081: 3, 200619052: 3, 200160322: 3, 200378363: 3, 200134533: 3, 110736595: 3, 109077806: 3, 107410579: 3, 112457092: 3, 108739976: 3, 200224245: 3, 110469888: 3, 107288223: 2, 107643093: 2, 107661795: 2, 107494116: 2, 105930639: 2, 106098470: 2, 106534265: 2, 108417349: 2, 108107749: 2, 109316466: 2, 107124738: 2, 107976181: 2, 107773642: 2, 108370856: 2, 110450478: 2, 112038160: 2, 106045498: 2, 112396583: 2, 109048457: 2, 106095990: 2, 109151172: 2, 200248595: 2, 200241195: 2, 107134757: 2, 107850573: 1, 109409153: 1, 111468616: 1}"
North Ridge,105873517,Trad,105873288,5.5,250,3,3.4,242.0,"Pitch 1: Climb the left wall through some steep ground to a belay slightly back to the right.   Pitch 2: Follow a series of cracks up a nice, easy low angle and exposed face to a belay ledge. Belay or combine this with the next pitch.   Pitch 3: From the ledge head up and right around a roof to a vegetated ledge. Belay up and continue to the summit roped or unroped depending on your comfort level.    Fantastic route! I always recommend this route to anyone visiting Table for the first time. It can be a bit windy. While not the longest route in the area, it has the best position, high over a saddle between Table Rock and Hawksbill. You get great views of the upper gorge, Hawksbill and Grandfather Mountain to the north.","{107606573: 4, 105854062: 4, 11387: 4, 107661795: 4, 105912413: 4, 105886022: 4, 105930639: 4, 107613407: 4, 107494770: 4, 107288223: 4, 106056907: 4, 106098470: 4, 106452603: 4, 105787467: 4, 106329936: 4, 106410370: 4, 107296004: 4, 106272278: 4, 107346687: 4, 106741672: 4, 106719439: 4, 106901183: 4, 108126116: 4, 107029006: 4, 107290177: 4, 106077771: 4, 107050213: 4, 106805249: 4, 107219020: 4, 108379285: 4, 106520944: 4, 107978046: 4, 108668039: 4, 108417349: 4, 105833953: 4, 107244972: 4, 106377758: 4, 108370856: 4, 107631686: 4, 108634739: 4, 109178187: 4, 110329497: 4, 109564901: 4, 108195020: 4, 107636562: 4, 106707039: 4, 108686410: 4, 107079383: 4, 107960452: 4, 110575679: 4, 110236104: 4, 110469888: 4, 111212017: 4, 105833163: 4, 106912228: 4, 110678844: 4, 109940623: 4, 109048457: 4, 110240029: 4, 111660364: 4, 109245504: 4, 112124233: 4, 112151630: 4, 111886470: 4, 107016978: 4, 111277126: 4, 112104441: 4, 12023: 4, 109187861: 4, 200058393: 4, 110488065: 4, 112285586: 4, 111504934: 4, 112415495: 4, 200040300: 4, 108139500: 4, 111149366: 4, 200177699: 4, 111312458: 4, 200223048: 4, 112433726: 4, 110323884: 4, 200109224: 4, 106477363: 4, 106873063: 4, 112513275: 4, 112568421: 4, 108220692: 4, 112038160: 4, 107083075: 4, 112035468: 4, 111951594: 4, 108212790: 4, 200305364: 4, 107423457: 4, 107563513: 4, 111203516: 4, 200148474: 4, 200009681: 4, 200453736: 4, 200066055: 4, 109423338: 4, 200124378: 4, 107051650: 4, 200241195: 4, 106090254: 4, 200619052: 4, 107539169: 4, 200020052: 4, 200566155: 4, 200557621: 4, 112401943: 4, 200499702: 4, 109406002: 4, 200360582: 4, 107318184: 4, 200446866: 4, 108739976: 4, 200946153: 4, 106083305: 4, 200582191: 4, 106891967: 3, 107277859: 3, 105898716: 3, 105904878: 3, 106386525: 3, 106372148: 3, 106068243: 3, 106140166: 3, 105841087: 3, 106449553: 3, 106327975: 3, 106752046: 3, 106534265: 3, 106116879: 3, 106887229: 3, 106488744: 3, 106944348: 3, 106941307: 3, 106967373: 3, 107034760: 3, 106633305: 3, 106913650: 3, 106870556: 3, 107320693: 3, 107729640: 3, 107861772: 3, 107775726: 3, 108659936: 3, 109151883: 3, 108308016: 3, 108307718: 3, 105964643: 3, 109316466: 3, 108155370: 3, 107124738: 3, 108376511: 3, 109225164: 3, 108363423: 3, 109633459: 3, 107481504: 3, 107632893: 3, 109293680: 3, 106751393: 3, 107943592: 3, 108661995: 3, 108119334: 3, 107074538: 3, 111029678: 3, 107270055: 3, 107324126: 3, 109043313: 3, 109771641: 3, 108402770: 3, 109765597: 3, 109383300: 3, 110450478: 3, 109079758: 3, 107232016: 3, 108088813: 3, 109907430: 3, 107958782: 3, 108270652: 3, 110652445: 3, 108981063: 3, 109606781: 3, 111520764: 3, 111160230: 3, 106788819: 3, 110956309: 3, 113453662: 3, 200068081: 3, 112303170: 3, 105860008: 3, 111795422: 3, 200084381: 3, 200129124: 3, 200007735: 3, 106919775: 3, 108400997: 3, 7035557: 3, 112359946: 3, 106095990: 3, 112396583: 3, 200181469: 3, 111468616: 3, 200143564: 3, 111151975: 3, 111239574: 3, 112045789: 3, 200211147: 3, 106596992: 3, 110327172: 3, 107134757: 3, 107795619: 3, 109409153: 3, 110736595: 3, 107671600: 2, 107940574: 2, 107504797: 2, 106243972: 2, 106300559: 2, 106654299: 2, 106712274: 2, 106936410: 2, 107261990: 2, 109701190: 2, 108297950: 2, 109177228: 2, 106045498: 2, 112265078: 2, 200150490: 2, 107224041: 2, 110531724: 2, 200142491: 2, 113581879: 2, 107769068: 2, 113187400: 2, 200246366: 2, 107850573: 1, 200235059: 1, 7110370: 0}"

Continue up to the left side of the arete.  Be sure to place the crucial piece of gear here before pulling around.  Pull around the sharp arete to the right and up.  There is an optional piece of gear out right, but can cause a lot of drag if not on double ropes.  Continue up the arete to the short slab.  Pull the short slab into another dihedral.

Move left after the short dihedral and belay on a sizable ledge with trad gear.    Option 2, start 20' to the right of said dihedral. Climb up jugs and mail slots with many more gear opportunities.

Two options of very different character, but similar difficulty.  P1 Start as per the first pitch/approach of the Broach up an easy section just right of Lynn Cove Lullaby. Continue up through the corner staring at the right arching roof of the Broach but when you get to a good flat obvious ledge you can build a belay making this pitch around 5.6 or so.  OR make P1 a little longer and include the first 10ish crux section to take it to a higher belay.  From the end of the 5.6 part/first belay option, up and a bit left is a left leaning corner with a few broken up sections. The last bit of this is a cruxier region but protects well if you are observant. Pull through the end of this corner and, after exiting it, trend a little up and right into a nice corner under the big roof, although beware the loose looking chockstone sorta lodged there. A good gear belay can be had here with some big stoppers and finger to mid-sized gear.  P2 10c: Either do the above if you stopped sooner, or move out left from the higher belay and follow the cracks at the top of the corner to make a pumpy leftward high traverse using the vertical hand crack (and bad feet) out left to gain the face where Lynn Cove finishes. Crank through a bit of vert at the end to close things out.

This is a much more interesting finish to Almost Seven (aka Golden Earring) than the traverse out left and is highly recommended.","{106273107: 4, 200255597: 4, 106712274: 4, 109771641: 4, 106030214: 4, 106389733: 4, 107343989: 4, 110944243: 4, 112150355: 4, 106820629: 4, 107232016: 4, 106087815: 4, 110937405: 4, 111951594: 4, 106655109: 4, 107636562: 3, 107563513: 3, 106452833: 3, 108709053: 3, 110323884: 3, 112254411: 3, 111821256: 3, 200262639: 3, 200422970: 3, 108097063: 3, 109488917: 3, 106919775: 3, 112163760: 3, 109293680: 3, 106375608: 3, 105896358: 3, 109113775: 3, 106064884: 3, 108422049: 3, 106314584: 3, 106720671: 3, 106488744: 3, 106056907: 3, 106590161: 3, 12084: 3, 106525658: 3, 106961703: 3, 107287077: 3, 107267683: 3, 106427485: 3, 108916902: 3, 108402770: 3, 108361107: 3, 107270055: 3, 108661995: 3, 108170319: 3, 106900293: 3, 106083305: 3, 109316466: 2, 108686410: 2, 107470720: 2, 106298371: 2, 105964643: 2}"

Get ready to put your tail in the wind as it's really exposed and quite steep, at the end it feels like something from Sauratown.    Climb Wailing Wall as usual through the initial face but when you turn the corner halfway up trend more right, specifically on the right side of the wide vertical crack spitting the upper face (although really you can go anywhere so long as you end up at the same roof exit). Be careful of some loose blocks and a little crumbly rock as you do so. Aim for the L shaped spot in the roof. To get out, pull the roof on the left side and battle the lichen to top out.     Once you hit the bulgy section, the difficulty ramps up gradually, and the pro gets not as good but once you get up to hanging off the L there's a couple decent small cams to keep you out of danger, although I wouldn't want to fall placing them. If you had a really big cam (5 or 6?) you might be able to protect in a big horizontal just below that. If you head further right you can hang out on a big ledge to take a breather or get psyched. The final pull through the exit roof is the crux move as it's kinda licheny and a bit slopey.    If you run it out a bit in spots and runner well it's OK to link this up into a single pitch but two pitches might be easier on a first pass. Plus falling at the roof might be challenging to get back on if you have too much rope out and your belayer can't hear or see you.     One last note: take care in the L area, as the edge of that horizontal crack is quite sharp, I cut my hand pretty well in there.","{108745969: 4, 200143564: 3, 200262639: 3, 200422970: 3, 106488744: 2, 108170319: 1}"

None the less it turned out to be a neat little line.    Start at the large tree growing against the right wall and boulder up to a ledge. The initial crux sequence from here would be a little scary if this was anywhere near your lead limit and to be honest is scary 'period' - as the first piece of gear is high on an exposed face with nothing to help you if you botch the thin sequence.

It is the most exposed and intimidating piece of real estate in central NC, possibly the state and on the short list of the southeast. If this route does not challenge your sense of well being then you are indeed invincible.   Not many cliff lines harbor such an anomaly. The radical climbing and outrageous positioning would make this a poster child route for any area. Climbing 5.13 and placing gear under a dead horizontal roof with the crux 25' out the lip and 200' of air beneath you is mind bending. Mother Nature just doesn't produce it often.    Porter Jarrard initially looked at this line in the 80's, ultimately concluding,""the hardest part about this line is going to be finding somebody to climb it.""    I started working on it in the mid 90's but never got back for an attempt at the monster line, which first ascends the knee knocking Windigo before entering deep enemy territory.   Recently, I revisited the route and completed Survival Of The Fittest.    The hardest thing about this route is not the power or the individual moves but rather the stamina to hold on and pull the lip after placing gear on lead for 100' of steep climbing. If you were willing to skip the roof gear and run it out, the difficulty could be scaled back a notch.    There are a couple options for cleaning this route. The easiest is belaying from the top but it's scary with considerable rope drag and tough anchor points for the necessary safety; not advised. The other option is to build a small anchor above the lip to lower from and have your second clean Windigo. Then hike around and clean from above. This is also somewhat challenging. Welcome to 'old school' 101.... Or is that 102 or 103 maybe?? Either way, this line is an undertaking and puts up resistance from start to finish.  Climb Windigo to the good stance section on the left side of the tower, just below roof level. Start working out right to the base of the roof placing multiple smaller cams along the way. Dive into the business and power the first crux half way out the roof. Pass two old bolts to the base of a splitter crack in the roof's underbelly. Climb the crack, placing a 1.5 - 2.5"" cam and then a medium size nut before pulling the lip to salvation.","{108187978: 4, 106146432: 4}"

However, caution and proper safety gear should always be used.     Update: there are now three bolts and a separate set of rings at the top.

However, you might find the traverse to be worse than just climbing straight up to the anchors. When we were climbing this on trad gear, we would top out by making the traverse or by angling up to the right in order to access the top.  I can't remember the exact date we bolted the route but it was purposely left off of here to keep people off of it. There was a loose block that was shaped in such a way that it would not come out from the wall. Rather than mess with it any more and risk damaging the route, the rock was bolted in place with a long anchor. Some may feel that the second bolt is a bit runout from the first, but there was no decent rock in which to install an additional bolt. The climbing is solid enough to not really need another bolt.

About midway between the ground and the overlap, there are some flakes for placing the only pro until reaching the overlap. Depending on what I have, I use from a .75 up to a #2 BD C4. A #1 or #2 C4 works best. Once above your pro, find the weakness in the bulge to the right. Move to the right until over the bulge and head straight up to the V-notch. Plug a cam or two, with runners, under the overlap and climb up through the notch to the trees.    Some may find it a little runout but that is just normal climbing at Stone.

This is your first pro and is about 75' off the ground. Be very careful as this is 5.9/5.10 rock and a fall could be unhealthy. Leave the dike and climb straight up from the bolt to a set of double anchors below the dark head-wall.    The second pitch passes one bolt then heads right up into the dark streak of the head-wall. All of the rock in the head-wall is covered in vegetation and debris from the large amount of runoff. It would need to be properly cleaned before leading the head-wall. The second bolt is located near the top of the steep portion. This is an old bolt and was not replaced during the re-bolting effort by the CCC. Finish the pitch at the flake on the left or continue up to one last bolt.    Finish the route by climbing easy rock to the top. There are no anchors on the right side of the mountain so it may be necessary to belay from a tree on the tree island to the left. Come back down to the anchors on the pulpit, traverse left for anchors on the top, or walk off.    I have lead the very runout first pitch twice. The first time, I just didn't feel good at the head-wall on the second pitch and retreated. The second time, it began raining as I was about 30' up with zero gear on 5.10 rock. I attempted to downclimb and made it to about the 20' mark but couldn't go any further without jumping off. Thankfully, the rain stopped and I was able to continue back up. I made it about 10' or 15' past the first bolt on the second pitch and slipped. I don't generally fall so my belayer was not paying attention and I fell a bit further than I should have and jacked my ankle on a small ledge. I have since gone back and top-roped the second pitch through the head-wall. It was more difficult than any of the other 5.10+ routes I have climbed at Stone.

The Pulpit,105894448,Trad,105887506,5.8,800,5,3.1,88.0,"After you've done the Tree Ledge classics like the Great Arch and No Alternative, you'll probably be ready to take a bigger bite out of Stone Mountain.  The Pulpit is a great choice for a long, bottom-to-top moderate lead, with some interesting variety beyond straight-ahead friction.  The climbing is exciting enough to get your blood pumping but never really desperate.  Though the ""Selected Climbs"" guidebook comment on this being the mountain's best protected route isn't really accurate (the Arch takes that honor), the Pulpit is definitely well-protected by Stone Mountain standards.    P1 -- starting at an arching, left-facing corner, climb the corner to its end, then straight up on good friction to the left end of a sloping ledge.  Clip a bolt above the ledge and traverse right to the end of the ledge (good pro along the way in a horizontal feature).  Climb straight up to another bolt, then follow a steep but featured shallow groove (crux) to a third bolt.  At the end of the groove, trend up and right past a fourth bolt to bolted anchors (hanging belay).  5.8, ~160'    P2 -- continue friction climbing straight up past two bolts, about 60'.  At the second bolt, traverse left following the path of least resistance until you're below the obvious anchors; a fixed pin that once was a landmark here is gone.  Easy climbing on scoops and actual holds leads you to the belay.  This is probably the only pitch where there's no real opportunity for gear placements.  5.8, ~120'    P3 -- diagonal up and right on easy ground to an obvious shallow left-facing corner; small brass and/or a pink tricam may come in handy.  Step up onto the corner and delicately traverse right for about 50' (no protection), crossing a shallow water groove that may or may not be dry.  Finish at a spacious and comfortable alcove known as the Oasis -- a nice spot for a lunch break if no other climbers are coming up behind you.  5.8, ~150'    P4 -- from the Oasis, climb up and right to the parallel dikes that form Grand Funk Railroad; a small overlap before the dikes offers a possible gear placement.  Follow the Grand Funk dikes up to that route's P4 belay anchors; clip the anchor for pro, then leave the dikes and continue more or less straight up to a large flake (the Pulpit).  This pitch is a rope-stretcher.  Belay at anchors above the flake.  5.8-, 180'    P5 -- continue up on easier terrain to the top; an overlap maybe halfway up the pitch can be used for pro to increase your comfort level.  This is another rope-length pitch; if you're climbing on a 70m rope, you might make it to the No Alternative rap anchors over to the far left, but only if you forego placing pro.  If your rope is a 60m, don't chance it; head straight up to a tree island and anchor in the trees, then make your way climber's left to the No Alternative anchors.  5.3, 180'","{111607851: 4, 111722665: 4, 107270055: 4, 105886712: 4, 110535430: 4, 106095990: 4, 106064884: 4, 107435282: 4, 107320693: 4, 111277008: 4, 107595718: 4, 107277859: 4, 200444961: 4, 106077771: 4, 107290177: 4, 109113775: 4, 107753484: 4, 106655109: 4, 107324126: 3, 107599789: 3, 108119334: 3, 107453284: 3, 106726952: 3, 109633459: 3, 108686410: 3, 108661995: 3, 106901183: 3, 107074538: 3, 111886470: 3, 111239574: 3, 200143564: 3, 200459640: 3, 108212790: 3, 109151172: 3, 112254411: 3, 107559644: 3, 108370856: 3, 107219076: 3, 107978251: 3, 111504934: 3, 107563513: 3, 12023: 3, 110944243: 3, 107494770: 3, 112414163: 3, 109407862: 3, 106423825: 3, 106401915: 3, 105907433: 3, 106488744: 3, 106525658: 3, 106171212: 3, 107661795: 3, 107346687: 3, 105967115: 3, 107671600: 3, 106056907: 3, 106030214: 3, 105794964: 3, 105955017: 3, 106919775: 3, 106058175: 3, 107288223: 3, 105964643: 3, 107636562: 3, 106792700: 3, 107796938: 3, 108361107: 3, 107267683: 3, 106870556: 3, 107417154: 3, 106083305: 3, 106712274: 3, 107408896: 3, 105798243: 2, 111797672: 2, 107989551: 2, 111803330: 2, 108402770: 2, 106961703: 2, 105930639: 2, 105830665: 2, 108152984: 2, 109293680: 2, 12084: 2, 15023: 2, 109316466: 2}"

The climbing leading to the crux can be a little heady at times but isn't bad. The remainder of the pitch is a little runout but the climbing is only moderate.    The second pitch does not have any fixed protection but there are a few spots where some pro could be placed near the top of the pitch. Head up and slightly left towards the Oasis. Stay on the right side of the raised section of rock with a pine tree on top of it. The climbing through this area is only moderate but the lack of protection does make it dangerous. When nearing the pine, there are some thin, loose flakes to the right that should not be used for holds or pro as they could break off easily. Continue up and cross over to the left above the pine tree and into the safety of the Oasis. I usually choose to climb the second pitch with zero pro but there are a few spots where additional protection is possible, especially with the use of slings.

From there, a 30-40' runout section will get you to a shallow overhang, where you can thankfully place a cam before pulling the balancy move onto more friction to a short finish at bolted rap anchors on the Tree Ledge.","{112514908: 4, 106712274: 4, 106961703: 3, 106605044: 3, 111329070: 3, 106081626: 3, 109940623: 3, 109907430: 3, 106488744: 3, 107074538: 3, 106520944: 3, 112349543: 3, 112415495: 3, 109765597: 3, 107270055: 3, 106870556: 3, 112505050: 3, 110944243: 3, 106401915: 3, 107034760: 3, 107016978: 3, 111722665: 3, 111504934: 3, 109701612: 3, 109586477: 3, 107606573: 3, 200616950: 3, 110489156: 3, 110215865: 3, 106630015: 3, 105943486: 3, 111803330: 3, 111277008: 3, 106089041: 3, 107910870: 3, 106792700: 3, 106225416: 3, 107728622: 3, 106056907: 3, 105967115: 3, 107007035: 2, 107559644: 2, 12023: 2, 111950536: 2, 111941074: 2, 110652445: 2, 112320574: 2, 200557621: 2, 112846784: 2, 107563513: 2, 108474420: 2, 106095990: 2, 112254411: 2, 108121087: 2, 109771641: 2, 13937: 2, 107318184: 2, 106423825: 2, 106011891: 2, 106441036: 2, 106552384: 2, 11836: 2, 12084: 2, 107574703: 2, 106941307: 2, 106989253: 2, 106097293: 2, 105794964: 2, 105979386: 2, 105854062: 2, 105886712: 2, 107575582: 2, 105936209: 2, 106819472: 2, 106534265: 2, 106904274: 2, 107632893: 2, 106389733: 2, 109633459: 2, 109730916: 2, 108281071: 2, 107148964: 2, 108113821: 2, 106879805: 2, 107686628: 2, 109585732: 2, 107555213: 2, 110422165: 1, 105930639: 1, 111979834: 1, 108361107: 1, 107661795: 1, 112197849: 1, 107223178: 1, 107288223: 1, 107219464: 1}"
Wahoo Start,109433949,Trad,105887506,5.9,120,1,3.0,1.0,"This route starts with Peer Pressure and splits off just past the first bolt. The bolt is easily seen from the ground and is located on top of a small, left-facing corner with big jugs. There are multiple options for getting started up to the corner, all of fairly equal difficulty, but there is a downward angling dike leading up to the corner that works best. The crack in the corner is too shallow for most gear placements so don't bother. A few minor moves will get you to two very large jugs stacked on top of each other that eliminate the need for footholds, or protection. The bolt is just above the jugs. This is where the climb gets interesting. Step out to the right on a small but obvious foothold, preferably with the left foot. Pinch a nice crystal just above you with the left hand and reach way out to the right for another nice crystal that will allow you to stand on the foothold. Smear your right foot over a pea sized crystal and crimp your way up, placing your left foot on the crystal that you originally had your right hand on. If you can pull it off without slipping, the climb now turns easy. Now, head to the top of a big flake on the right with small pines growing out of it. Don't bother with cams, the climbing is easy and there is a bolt on the wall just above the flake. From the right side of the flake make a fairly easy traverse over to the belay rings for Dream Waves/Dixie Crystals. At about the midpoint of the traverse it is necessary to step down several feet, however, the friction is great and there are several good holds. This route is an alternate start for routes using the previously mentioned belay station. The two bolts provide protection just where it is needed and no additional pro is needed unless you just feel safer with it. An interesting traverse all the way to the Tree Ledge can also be made from the belay rings.",{107074538: 3}

I started just to the right of the groove on some decent holds and climbed up until there was a flake to my left. I stepped across the groove to the flake and placed two small cams so that I would have some protection before the bolt.    It is also possible to start at the crack that is usually used for Father Knows Best and climb to the left at the top of the crack. This way looked a little easier and allows for cam or nut placements in the small crack.    Once I placed my cams, I stepped back across the groove and headed straight for the lone bolt. Keep in mind that this bolt is even with the first bolt on Father Knows Best and due to the slope of the ground, this route is a little bit taller. A running belay is a must on this route. I did not need it but it was nice knowing it was there. There is no more protection at all past the bolt and no way to escape. I carefully followed the dark rock up to a large block on the tree ledge and moved right to use the belay rings above Father Knows Best. The climbing is a little stiff and just as difficult or more than Father Knows Best. Do not attempt climbing this route if you are not comfortable with the grade or the long runout.
