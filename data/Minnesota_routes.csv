Barn Dance,105826242,Sport,105813072,5.9,0,1,1.8,8.0,"Before there were bolts, setting up a climb at Redwing was a major engineering operation involving rappels into choss and requiring hundreds of feet of webbing. This was the route we climbed at the end of the day to pull ropes off many of the other climbs. We usually climbed it in the dark with hiking boots, too worn out from laps on Barn Burner to even bother switching to climbing shoes.     It is still a fun climb, and a safe, but challenging lead for the novice 5.9 leader. The climb runs left of the bolt line on Roof Burner, climbing the left corner of the roof, moving directly up and sharing the Roof Burner bolts. At the last bolt, there is an intimidating but fairly simple (5.7) left angled upward traverse to the Barn Dance anchors. From here, you can toprope Dead Dog Face if you so desire. From the last bolt you can also move right instead to finish on the Roof Burner anchors.     Alternately you can use the bolts on Dead Dog Face, but the last bolt takes you a long way off of the Barn Dance line.     Some feel the crux is pulling the roof, others find it in the dirty pockets following the roof. In either case, the holds are there, you just have to find them...     FYI, there is an alternate finish to the Roof Burner Bolts that is longer and also probably 5.9.  It seems many people are climbing that as Roof Burner, but they are not the same route.

Likewise, this route doesn't fit with most people's usual ideas about a high-quality rock climb- it is short, often seeping, and was originally climbed as an eliminate. However, the route offers super high-quality movement involving technical lie-backing up a shallow dihedral, and is a welcome addition to the stock of 5.10+/5.11- climbing at the Bluff.  As an eliminate that totally avoids the large flake of Way Knarly (see beta photo) the difficulty is around 5.11a/b. Using the flake beginning around the third bolt, the difficulty is around 10d.  It would be possible to extend this line to the anchors of Way Knarly, but the rock is of lower quality and often wet above the two-bolt anchor at approximately 30 feet.","{109623432: 3, 107247400: 0, 200131859: 0}"

The first move is a little bit of a stem up a slightly overhanging crack, and then moves over a quick little bulge (at about the 8ft mark) to easier ground up a hand/offwidth size mud choked crack. It continues straight up the crack feature, and ends in a dirt slope to the left of the slight overhanging feature over Syncopation. While the climb is relatively easy, gear is not reliable and should be approached with caution. Be prepared with a full set of cams, and put them where ever you can. A larger cam or two might be a good idea. Also a few small nuts could be put into the broken up face to the right of the crack, between it and Syncopation. Also, you will need to either do a double rope rappel from a tree on the top, down-climb, or walk off, as there are no anchors.

Kelly's Arete,105825378,Sport,105813066,5.12a,30,1,2.9,29.0,"Easily overlooked because of its longer, more popular neighbors to the right on the winter wall; Kelly's Arete offers superb, delicate climbing up the arete just to the left of Jam and Jelly.  Start up the crack until you can reach left and clip the first bolt.  At this point it is possible to move out onto the arete proper and begin the real climbing.  A good sidepull allows a long reach to clip the second bolt before beginning the crux, one of the best sequences you'll encounter at the bluff.  Reaching from a small left hand undercling, the right is bumped up the arete until a decent pinch is found.  Smearing the right foot against a ripple in the rock, the left is brought up to a good edge parallel with the undercling.  This position seems tailor made to generate an uncontrollable barndoor swing when the left hand is released, but with a deep dropknee you can release your hand just long enough to make an enormous reach to a slopey pocket up high.  A few desperate bumps and you can reach a decent hold around the arete to the right, leading to easier but still technical moves to reach the chains.  Unfortunately, clipping the third bolt is very difficult and comes right in the middle of the crux sequence, necessitating a horrible heelhook.  Some have chosen to skip the third bolt and climb through the crux before clipping.  This should be done with caution though, as a large fall is risked on a very short climb, and a grounder could occur.  Perhaps clipping the second bolt with a locking biner instead of a draw would help slightly, and obviously an attentive belayer is a must!  However you choose to do it, Kelly's Arete offers some of the bluff's most aesthetic climbing and should be high on everyone's ticklist.","{110271502: 4, 106507389: 4, 108071729: 4, 109877052: 4, 106335773: 4, 106715529: 3, 108998429: 3, 107977403: 3, 111680701: 3, 106136048: 3, 105996719: 3, 106415660: 3, 106153855: 3, 105849172: 3, 107074129: 3, 105872949: 3, 105887100: 3, 105871367: 3, 105926739: 3, 105952525: 3, 106140344: 3, 105919485: 3, 105828100: 2, 107247400: 2, 106558554: 2, 110166994: 2, 106047496: 2, 105966977: 2, 14216: 2}"

Mississippi,105826224,Sport,105813066,5.12c,60,1,3.6,43.0,"Mississippi (former ""Mississippi Burning"") is the classic Red Wing hard route. Very technical, crimpy, and pumpy; it climbs like a series of difficult boulder problems with hard moves coming all the way to a potentially bitter end. Like many of the harder routes at the bluff this one seems much harder until you figure out all the little tricks. Down low a long lockoff to a fingerlock sets you up for the first crux; either a big reach out left to bump off a very poor gaston or a wild three foot deadpoint all the way to the great incut edge up high. A few more tricky moves brings you to an excellent rest just left of Barnburner. The next fifteen feet of intense climbing takes you through a big stab out left for a pocket, powerful laybacking, and finally the crux of the climb: a traverse left to a decent rail. For those fortunate few over about 6'3"" or with a ridiculous ape-index, the rail can be reached all the way from the decent holds out right. Everyone else must bump using a slopey sidepull/pinch, a perpetually slimy crimp, and some worthless footholds with the difficulty inversely proportional to your height. The sustained nature of this section makes it very tiring to link because of the difficulty of clipping the bolts. A better option is to clip high and downclimb back to the good rest, then climb all the way from the jug to the rail without stopping, then clip the bolt at your knees. This way saves precious energy but requires a little more psyche as you contemplate the whipper while crimping the life out of that slimy edge! Once through the crux, it's not over yet. Another difficult boulder problem from the rail finally gets you to a hold worth writing home about. Ten more feet of moderate climbing leads to the anchors and, for most, the exhilarating experience of clipping the chains pumped out of your mind.

There are certainly some harder climbs at the bluff, but none personify so well the nature of hard climbing at Red Wing; incredibly crimpy, super technical, and very temperature dependent.  The first 50 feet are incredibly sustained, with no real letup until you reach the jug at bolt six; from there to the top is relatively easy 5.10 climbing with ample opportunity to depump before sneaking through the band of choss on top to reach the anchors.  The bottom two thirds of the route consists of three very difficult boulder problems, each one harder than the last, linked by easier but extremely technical terrain.  The first powerful, crimpy boulder problem gets you to the second bolt and the bottom of the distinctive seam/crack that diagonals up the lower part of the wall.  The seam consists of super techy 5.11+ that may seem impossible until you find the right sequence of microscopic footholds to see you through.  At the end of the seam, the next boulder problem tackles a powerful gaston and match on a slopey rail to reach the large pocket which is much worse than it looks.  Make the difficult clip from the pocket, then move left to reach the ""rest"" at a four inch long, incut crimper.  I would not consider this a rest on any other route, but you take what you can get and this is far and away the best hold between the ground and the jug at 50 feet.  Shake out as best you can before tackling another ten feet of awkward, technical 5.11 climbing to reach the ultimate crux of the route and the hardest individual moves, right after the fifth bolt.  There are numerous sequences for the last boulder problem, but they invariably all use the same razor sharp 1/4 inch crimper, tiny iron oxide gaston high and right, and some combination of worthless ripples and pockets as intermediates to reach the flat, positive crimper that finishes this V5 sequence.  Bearing down on the sharp holds enough to stick the last moves as your forearms reach meltdown is, needless to say, a good test of pain tolerance and tenacity.  Two more big reaches will bring you to that ""thank god"" jug out right and the end of the difficulties.

Do some face moves that are very protectable to a horizontal flaring crack that leads to the hand crack. Before the traverse there is a really nice cam placement and then start the awkward traverse right, I think I might have got a hex in on the traverse.    Now your at the bottom of the hand crack.

Climbing on gems like this is why you traveled all the way back here. Only con is that it will seep for a while after a heavy rain, so if you find it dry, jump on it!  After some excellent 5.12 climbing to get things warmed-up, the crux involves wrestling into the flare, engaging some trickery, then dynoing out of the flare to a sloper and figuring out how to match the rail. Keep it together for the next sequence to pull on the slab, and enjoy a victory lap on slightly runout, occasionally crunchy lichen slab to the top out.  This route was originally bolted by Josh Helke over ten years ago and named the Organical project. Josh has long since left the northlands and established the highly successful Organic Climbing company. Like any entrepreneur who takes some risks, Helke took risks on this rig by bolting a lose block and which came down with the bolt still attached in a terrifying, thunderous crash. Fortunately, no one was hurt, but rumor is a black bear was severely startled and moderately traumatized when the block came down while it was sun bathing and rummaging through a bag of trail mix left by climbers. You can still see the fallen flake with the bolt attached on top of the boulder below the climb.   The first ascent was done in a bug shirt, which was thrown down in the double knee bars just before firing the crux. After flying back to MN from Boston for a Memorial Day trip, Bob Omann and I were not about to bail even with plague level sand flies. When I hollered in celebration at the anchors, I was in turn startled to see the Canadian customs officer on top who was hiking on a day off. After enjoying some whiskey he had on hand, we all hiked out together. Bob had been dead baiting for lake trout at the trailhead while we climbed and when we arrived, the rod was gone. Bob spotted it 10 feet off shore, swam out, and just as the rod dove down he snagged it, nearly getting pulled into the depths. After some screams, grunting and slipping in the mud and 20 minutes of fighting latter he landed a massive trout and there was much rejoicing.

The Bow Hunter,109356291,Boulder,109255860,V2,12,1,2.0,3.0,"Once upon a time in 2012, I was visiting Sandstone for my second or third time with two buddies.  One of them had never been there, the other had been a few times with climbers who regularly went there.  The latter gentleman was driving.  He parked in front of the locked gate at the end of the dirt road that now, in 2014, is open to the climbing community.  At the time, this was still private land.    We hiked down to the boulders, spent the day climbing, and returned to his car to find a massive truck parked inches from his bumper.  We were blocked in.  We called out for a while and several minutes later, a man in camouflage and blaze orange approached us from the woods.  He carried in his hand, a bow.    The hunter was not happy that we were there and proceeded to tell us that he had permission from the land owners to hunt there and that we were not allowed.  We explained that it was our understanding that climbers had verbal permission from the owner to be there, but if we were wrong about that, we would not return.  In this conversation, the hunter said the land was for sale and that he would buy it and not allow climbers to return.    He drove off and we made our way back down the road worried about what had just happened.  I reached out to the MCA about the situation and a series of events was set into motion.  In 2013, the climbing community banded together, worked with the non-profit Parks & Trails Council of MN, and helped PTCM purchase the land preserving climbers access.    If we had not run into that hunter that day, if he had not been so angry and threatened us with the idea of purchasing the land for himself, what a different story it might have been.    In the fall of 2013, I began exploring Eldon on my own looking for things that seemed unclimbed.  This problem was my first attempt at developing something in this area.    In honor of that man, it is named The Bow Hunter.    Sit start on crimps below the roof, work up to the base of the left side of the roof, use crimps to work out to the nose, then mount that sucker.

The Fall of Ascomycetes,114985890,Trad,105814857,5.11b,50,1,2.7,3.0,"Fun engaging climbing with some confusing options regarding top and bottom half.   For a long time, only the top half of this climb had been done (from the hanging bolted belay). Although a first pitch had been identified, it had not been free climbed.  In 2018, Kurt Hager and Rob Pilaczynski did the first top rope ascent of the whole route from the talus and then Alex Ristow did the first lead of the whole route shortly thereafter.  What is quite confusing about this climb is that the first “pitch” of this climb doesn’t join the second pitch at the belay station its actually above the belay (see photos). So its one pitch either way, just depends where you start I guess. The second “pitch” is the same as the second pitch of Mital’s Roof which does have a first pitch directly below the bolted anchor and seperate from the first ""pitch"" of this climb.  I swear I felt the whole upper flake flexing at times so it seemed like it would be pretty spooky to lead.  Also you are either going from old shitty bolts or doing it from the talus which is R rated. So any way you cut it, it’s a pretty serious/scary lead.  I have personally only done the top pitch, so not sure about details on TRing the bottom, but it seems you would need a few directionals since it is not plumb line.  If you do only the top pitch, simply lower/rap to the bolted anchor (definitely don’t trust your life to those old bolts) and climb the corner to the top.

Johnny Tsunami,119649001,Trad,105814857,5.11d,130,2,4.0,2.0,"Starting on a cozy ledge just a few feet above the frigid water of Lake Superior, chimney up the water polished rock and out above the lake, eventually committing to an overhanging hand and fist crack on the right side of the chimney. Once at the horizontal roof, traverse out right through a finger crack with some key feet.  Pull the lip continuing up the steep finger crack dihedral to its end where you can traverse left to a decent sized ledge ending the first pitch. The second pitch climbs the much easier but still engaging dihedral to the top. Rock quality is poor for the first 40 ft of the second pitch and is PG-13. Climbing is 5.9ish. The entire first pitch including the hard climbing protects very well. .Some fine print on this logistical nightmare:This route is a lot of work before you even start climbing.  Whether you are TRing or leading, you need to get to a belay ledge that is 2 feet off the water and 20ft in from a plumb line rappel under a big roof. For TR you HAVE to have directionals (or you could fall into the lake) so you horizontal/down aid while rappelling, clipping pro for directionals. If leading it makes sense to do 2 pitches and end the pitch at the mid route ledge as your rope drag is getting pretty heinous due to the roof and subsequent traverse to the ledge. Originally led as one pitch with some double rope shenanigans.Best Logistics for Top RopingTR solo is a must due to, rope stretch with low crux, mega rope drag, and lack of communication with the top.  Rap down the upper dihedral (no directionals needed) to the obvious ledge. Move out right to the steep/slightly over hanging dihedral. Place a .3 at head height and rebelay/clove hitch this piece to reduce rope stretch through the low crux. Continue placing a couple more directionals down this over hanging dihedral. Once you reach the horizontal roof you will need to aid across it and eventually down the steep fist crack clipping your rope to pieces for directionals as you go. If someone else is TRing after you, leaving pieces in place makes it much easier for subsequent climbers. Doubles .3-3 needed for directionals. Best Logistics for LeadBoat approach: Yep this is the easiest way. There is a small parking lot off of Highway 61 about a half mile north of Palisade where you can walk a canoe or raft down to the lake and paddle south. Rappel approach: Getting to the belay ledge for leading is a bit easier than for TR since you don't need to place directionals and can go on the left side of the roof which is a little smaller. There are some slight variations to this, but this will likely be the easiest. Rap down do the obvious ledge at the bottom of the dihedral. Set an anchor here and pull your rope. Then do the following1. Fix one end of your rope to the anchor and start rappelling hard left. 2.Place a .75 in a horizontal crack on the left side of a small dihedral at the same level as the belay ledge you just left and clip your rappel line to this as a directional (you will be able to reach down and get this from the belay ledge later). 2.Rap down until even with or slightly below some obvious jugs on the left side of the chimney and the fixed nut (see pics). Tension traverse in using side pull crimps and eventually the good jugs to reach a fixed nut with a carabiner on it. Easiest to PAS to the nut and then pull slack to clip your rap line. 3. Lower down level with belay ledge while swinging in. or tension traversing in the chimney. Have some cams ready to place for your anchor.  Set anchor on the ledge using .1-.4 cams. You have used less than 25m of rope to get down there, so you will use the remaining part of your rope to lead up the right side of the roof. Once back at your anchor, end the pitch and untie the fixed end and your belayer can pull the rope down through the fixed nut to retrieve your rope and you can reach down to clean the .75. You could also double rope rappel in and pull your rope if you want a much more committing experience. Also definitely use a gri when tension traversing in, its a 2 handed affair. Your second should probably TR solo although from the mid route ledge you may be able to top belay. .Seasonal Note: The roof crack seems to stay pretty wet in the spring even if it hasn't rained for several days. Bone dry in the fall though. Difficulty:I’m pretty torn on the grade. On one hand it isn't very technical, but it's a burlfest that doesn’t let up. So please let me know what you think when you get on it. Wind/WavesThe belay ledge is only a couple feet off the water, so if there is a NE wind, with even medium sized waves, you are going to get wet. Its all a part of the experience!","{106307305: 4, 112147018: 4}"

Once on route proper the climbing remains straightforward through crack systems up to a slabby off-width where a natural chock with two pieces of worn nylon webbing are tied with water knots. Top out of that short but strenuous crack to a stance with two crumbling but sturdy, stubby  pillars.     P2) From the belay disappear around the corner to the left on a small but easily traversed ledge, with great exposure to your right over looking the lake. A relatively easy series of ledges leading up and down  to the ominous dark chimney / off-width climbing ahead requires some route finding skills and commitment.
