Once over the lip, breath and relax, while collecting yourself clip a bolt, and contemplate the crux sequence while trying to find the holds. The slab holds the real crux and feels exposed while being safely protected. After a short section of climbing that is harder that it feels like it should be, you can relax. Clip one more bolt before the anchor. Some chalk on this one really helps as the upper crux section tends to attract pine needles.

There are three variations to this start, but most people opt to enter from the right on big, chalked holds.  After clipping the bolt (gear can easily substitute), move up on a few slopey holds before hitting the jams.  What's great about this climb is the variety of jams ranging mixing fingers, hands, fists, and even a little OW to gain a good rest, but the choice remains mostly yours as several sizes are often available depending on what suits you.  If you can fight off the pump long enough, one hard move starting the leftward traverse marks the end of the difficult climbing which ends as the crack turns the corner.  If, TR'ing, you can end here or finish up on Green Corner or try the arete above.    Though the climb has always been dry when I've seen it even when others are soaking, the crack and face tend to be a little dirty, so either bring a brush or find solid jams because they may slide out unexpectedly.

The topo sketch they have is not much more detailed, and so to the best of my knowledge, I believe the route is supposed to finish somewhat to the left of the smaller overhang under the pine tree at the top.  I didn't find protection on this part of the face and tried going up slightly to the right where the options for gear seemed better.  I think that might actually be another route though (Blue Angel, a 5.8) and the protection wasn't that great either.  I backed off and finished the second pitch of The Chimney instead.  If anyone has more definitive information on this route, please message me and I'll update this description.  Alternatively, I hope to get back on this and give it another shot.

With the extremely sparse information surrounding Pollen, my best guess is that this is indeed a more difficult variation, and that the original veers off to the left after the start. This could obviously be wrong, but regardless I will document in much more detail this climb, because I think it is simply fantastic and is easily my favorite in the reservation.  This climb begins with a sit start on the hole in the wall. From there, it progresses through a few easy moves until the right hand leverages a deep three finger sidepull, allowing the left hand to swing up into the crux hold. This hold itself is quite good, comfortably allowing three fingers on the left hand. I, however, found that in order to successfully match this hold I needed to only catch it with two and stack them on the left side. This allowed for the match and top out. The footholds are good the whole way up. Most holds are deep but will only accommodate 2 or 3 fingers, making this climb feel very unique for the rock type.  Beta video HERE.",{200760577: 3}

It is a 20 foot climb with a nice flat landing, but a big boulder does loom directly behind the route.  The start involves working your way up onto the flake with the thin seam. You end up standing on this seam. Directly above and to the left, there is a crimp rail. Work your way up to that rail. There is also a nice sidepull/jug out left that can be used to gain the position to be able to pull the mantel move required to get you on top of the crimp rail. This is where the ""heady"" business starts. Use the large flake above you as an undercling, and smear your feet on the blank face. Make one last big move to the top lip.  Caution: The large flake at bottom is not the most solid piece, and also the top-out hold gets thinner on its right side. Try to work your way up to the more solid feeling piece up and left at the top.  Options: There are some options for a good additional start to this climb.
