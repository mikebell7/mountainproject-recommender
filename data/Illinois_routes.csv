Once you establish moving upward, it only gets easier to the top.","{200231434: 4, 200694135: 4, 112273728: 4, 200293932: 4, 107040811: 4, 200446503: 4, 200169290: 4, 111925488: 4, 106809240: 4, 200254731: 4, 112304915: 4, 200338585: 4, 112350123: 4, 110607462: 4, 200095788: 3, 200346291: 3, 110968389: 3, 112173761: 3, 200101945: 3, 7041384: 3, 108373400: 3, 200480811: 3, 110685425: 3, 110329286: 3, 200452529: 3, 200213045: 3, 200619051: 3, 111690225: 3, 200300892: 3, 200682079: 3, 200693229: 3, 112003012: 3, 200500647: 3, 200387274: 3, 200473323: 3, 200093542: 3, 111859893: 3, 200628407: 3, 112816136: 3, 111127829: 3, 107734618: 3, 109285215: 3, 110524227: 3, 112002095: 3, 108046773: 3, 110959609: 3, 107521255: 3, 111708751: 3, 110642863: 3, 110927013: 3, 111820110: 3, 112142545: 3, 106751248: 3, 112260466: 3, 110998676: 3, 109607267: 3, 112794950: 3, 111882068: 3, 111100213: 3, 110301945: 2, 11178: 2, 110985244: 2, 108417901: 2, 108034204: 2, 105822471: 2, 108894743: 2, 106020029: 2, 109744782: 2, 109052547: 2, 112245126: 2, 108043082: 2, 107612754: 2, 107799943: 2, 200446012: 2, 111981168: 2, 200188896: 2, 110850356: 2, 110853696: 2, 109228346: 2, 106744745: 1, 109230058: 1}"

The distance between any two markers is approximately 10 ft. Start at the metal gate on Hart St and traverse east to the Wolcott Ave. There are two major boulder problems as cruxes. However, the real challenge is linking 255 feet of crimps, slopers, gastons, underclings, side pulls, and small footholds without getting pumped.
